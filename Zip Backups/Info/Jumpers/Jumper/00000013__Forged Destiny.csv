Labour Caste,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Also called NPCs (Need Protection Caste). Blacksmiths, Tailors, Farmers and more make up this caste. The Labour Caste is the working people’s caste, the bottom of the social/cultural ladder that provides for their betters and are protected by them in turn. Many from the other castes look down upon the Labour Caste, thinking of them as helpless and in need of protection, hence the name NPC. Most Labour classes have an A rank in Resilience. Start somewhere between lvl 11-14.,,
Hero Caste,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,Knights, Archers and Mages are examples of the classes found in the Hero Caste. The Hero Caste is highly valued as the protectors of mankind and only 5 percent of the population are in the Hero Caste, with another 30 percent belonging to the Soldier Caste. Possessing generally higher stats then the other Classes, especially focused in the combat stats where at least two will usually be A-Ranked. Their only real weakness is their generally low Resilience rank, making them susceptible to the Charisma of Nobles. Start somewhere between lvl 15-18.,,
Noble Caste,,0,,-1000,,True,,False,,Those of the Noble Caste fill the roles of Ambassadors, Scribes, Counts and Dukes. They are the ruling class and act as vassals to their king, ruling over different areas of the land or helping with administrative, logistic and legislative tasks. Most Noble classes have low potential in the physical stats but an A rank in Charisma. Start somewhere between lvl 13-16.,,
Human,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Pretty self-explanatory. You’re a standard human.,,
Faunus - Snake,,0,,-500,,True,,False,,Faunus, men and women with traits from animals, in this world are not discriminated against, at least never solely because of their race... As your status as a Faunus won’t change how people treat you and in most cases will be entirely beneficial, night vision or an extra limb to utilize your strength for example, you’ll have to pay for this option. Now go ahead! Be a bear-faunus druid, an owl-faunus scribe, a beaver-faunus builder or whatever else you may want!,,
Age,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Choose any age between 15-20%%%%If you buy Graduated, choose between 21-100,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Choose Freely%%%%1. Kingdom of Vale%%At the center of the world lies the Kingdom of Vale, a standard fantasy kingdom with mountains, plains and forests. Apart from the capital, home to Beacon Academy and the royal palace, there are several rural villages and coastal towns, connecting Vale to most of its trade partners by sea. The most traditional of the kingdoms, at least when it comes to the Caste system and the Grand Treaty, Vale could be said to be the standard that the other Kingdoms deviate from.%%%%2. Kingdom of Atlas%%Atlas is the northern continent of Remnant and as such suffers harsh and long winters. It was originally named Mantle, but was renamed Atlas after the Mage Wars one hundred and twenty years ago. Atlas’ major exports are dust, ore and minerals from their rich mines, while they import mostly food and fur for clothing and the topography is mostly mountainous in nature, though it evens out towards the shore. The kingdom is ruled by mages, a Magocracy, instead of Nobles. Mage-type classes, any class capable of using magic, are considered elevated from the Hero Caste and only those with the gift are applicable for positions of political power. To protect the mages are the Sentinels, an extra caste of sorts, who share a bit in the mages’ political power and can command other Heroes and Soldiers. The Archmage rules the city of Atlas, a king in his own right, while the kingdom is run by the Mage’s Circle.%%%%3. Kingdom of Mistral%%Situated on the continent to the east of Vale is the theocratic-monarchy of Mistral. It’s a place where religion and monarchy is intertwined, the God King of Mistral being both ruler and the head of the religion. Seen as the voice of God, or an avatar, the king is an object of worship for most of his subjects. Mistral’s culture is focused upon honour and loyalty, to the temple and the royal family both, and everyone has their place in society and are supposed to stick to it. Heroes here are well respected, even more so than in the other kingdoms, for the role they are expected to carry out as stalwart defenders of humanity.%%%%4. Kingdom of Vacuo%%Long ago, before their king made a pact with a terrible demon, this place was known as the Empire of Ashari, a rich and fertile land. Now it’s the Kingdom of Vacuo, a meritocracy be necessity, where which Caste you belong to means much less than elsewhere. The kingdom spanns a great desert, a major city, over twenty different wandering tribes and several coastal towns and forts. As most of the land is wild and untamed, Dungeons containing valuable treasure spawn here more often than compared to the other kingdoms. It is also home to the ruins of ancient kingdoms and a delightful variety of Grimm!%%%%5. The Mirage Islands%%What used to be a Pirate Kingdom, now the home of operation to the infamous Greycloaks. Life is cheap here and the population is divided into different crews and their respective captains, all competing for wealth and prominence. Three to five thousand people live here, compared to the other Kingdoms’ 100,000 to 200,000, and most want to kill each other all times of the day. It’s a lawless kingdom following the rule of the strong, if you hire a room here it would be considered rude not to try and kill you for example. Most goods are brought here through piracy.%%%%6. The College of Healing%%The College of Healing is a singular school attended by healing Classes from every Kingdom. It has its own treaties, like the Grand Treaty but more robust. Wealth from all four Kingdoms flows into it, along with the finest teachers and the most promising Soldiers to act as their guards. It is the place most Healer-Classes choose to attend, and also the reason why many of them are arrogant as few. Every student is told exactly how important they are, how far the Kingdoms will go for them and made fully to believe that they are irreplaceable, which reality mirrors as even a King would think twice on ordering a healer around. Depending on if you are one of the healer classes, perhaps a priest or shaman, or if you are of the Soldier/Labour Caste you will serve a different purpose here, your age will also indicate if you are a student or a teacher.,,
Class - Doomsayer + Paragon,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Choose a class fitting of your Origin, examples in the Notes section. Your Class also comes with a passive ability (examples in the notes) unique to you, though unless you buy a certain perk you can’t choose what this passive is. If you buy the Fifth Kingdom Item and your origin is the Noble Caste then you can choose King as your class.,,
Hello Fair Maiden,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,First impressions are important, you wouldn’t want to say the wrong thing and come of as a bumbling fool now would you? With this Perk you will be able to get a good read of someone’s personality by looking at them and focusing for a moment. Using this, and your now seriously impressive social skills, you will almost always be able to make a good first impression on the person you are talking to.,,
The First Quest,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,You are the very definition of beginner’s luck. When it comes to dealing with situations you are unfamiliar with your luck greatly increases and what abilities you have that relates to the thing you are doing are somewhat enhanced, meaning even someone incompetent can get a mediocre result. This luck isn’t all powerful, though; it just means fortune will favor you, and it will leave you after this first encounter; you’ll have to rely on your own abilities in future situations.,,
Aesthetics Rank S - Noble Caste,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Here comes the token good-looks perk of this jump. Choose a style, examples will be given below for each Caste but you can pick and choose freely no matter which Caste you are.%%%%Labour Caste - Your beauty is warm, your so called imperfections a part of what makes you beautiful. Unruly hair, freckles, calloused hands. You are the perfect example of ordinary beauty taken up to eleven, the farm-boy who became king or the merchant’s daughter who became the champion of her people. When normal people look at you, they will recognize you as one of them, even if your good looks surpasse all norms. Your beauty invokes love and fondness.%%%%Hero Caste - An electrical, fantastical, sensual appearance befitting a Hero. Your beauty stems from how it stands out compared to others. Traits such as blood-coloured hair, eyes of steel-grey or a body of impossible proportions all mark you as someone else, something else, a creature separate from the existence of the common man or woman. Wherever you go you attract attention not just for how good you look, but also from the way your appearance ensures everyone that you are anything but ordinary. Your beauty invokes lust and awe.%%%%Noble Caste - Cold is your beauty. No imperfections remain, your countenance made up of smooth hair, perfect teeth and flawless skin, your voice beautiful like chimes in the wind. Your beauty is that of the normal person but without any imperfections remaining, a face and body crafted by someone striving for the ideal of beauty itself, a goddess or god of beauty given flesh. Your inhumanly perfect looks attract attention in the way they represent your place above the common man, a beauty that they could never reach, and few are those who could bring themselves to mar it, to strike against such perfection. Your beauty invokes adoration and subservience.,,
Strange Knight,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Judging people by the things they can’t control is horrible you know? Thankfully enough, that won’t be a problem for you. You are able to walk through life without ever falling prey to the dark call of bigotry. You’re bereft of all biases, able to take in and understand stereotypes without having them rule your actions or cloud your judgement. All your decisions regarding other people are based upon your own objective knowledge of the situation and what common sense you possess.,,
Name and Occupation,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,In this world, everyone has their Name and Class hovering in the air above their heads, for all to see. What this perk does is that it allows you to see peoples names and ‘classes’, the role that fits them best, in future worlds too. A wizard focused on fire magic might show up as a Pyromancer and someone born with exceptional physical and mental abilities might have the class of Paragon hovering over their heads. Also, just to note, do remember that you are the only one who can see this, meaning illusionists and the like won’t know to hide it. Even a shapeshifter disguising themselves as your friend could be discovered with this ability, as their true name hovering in the air above them gives them away.,,
Graduated,,1,,00,,False,,True,,No longer a child, this means you’re around lvl 25-30 for Labour Caste classes, 50-70 for Hero Caste classes and somewhere in between for Noble Caste Classes, depending on your new age and circumstances. Labour Castes pay 100, Nobles 200 and Heroes 300 CP for this, seeing as so many Heroes fail their First Quest and are knocked down to the Soldier Caste as well as the fact that the relative gap between a young and old Hero is much greater than that of Labour Caste members.,,
Alleged Skills,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,With this you gain a strange ability unseen in this world, perhaps a remnant of the gods and the power of faith? Whatever its origin you possess the ability to gain new active skills as long as people believe you have them. For example, if you use oil and a torch to surreptitiously light your sword on fire and enough people see this you might gain the skill “Flaming Sword”, allowing you to replicate this feat in the future without using either oil or fire. This skill works better if it would make sense for you to have the skill and if more people think you have it. A for all appearances high-leveled knight who is witnessed by hundreds using what looks to be a skill common to his class could easily gain it while a Blacksmith claiming to be using a knight’s skill and getting one person to see it would have a harder time. With some trickery and an audience, you could go very far indeed!,,
Hybrid,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,A Hybrid. Multi-Class. Dual-Spec. Though none of these quite fit they are what can be used to describe your condition. You have somehow gained the ability to switch between two different classes. Your Level, Stats and Ranks stay the same when you change class (though your Ranks have probably been increased, combining the strengths of both classes) but your Passive Ability and Skills relating to the class change. This second class can be from any of the Castes but will probably be somewhat connected to your first class, and your Path will decide its skills (for example a Blacksmith becoming a Swordsmaster would have abilities related to equipment instead of slashing through people or Grimm). Keep this secret, Jumper, for you are probably yet so far the only one in the world with this ability, though there might be some like you in Vacuo who have undergone a certain journey to accomplish this...,,
Prestige Class - Doomsayer + Paragon,,1,,-14000,,True,,True,,Prestige Classes are rare classes, only a few appearing every century. They are the legends told of in myth, great leaders and warriors who shaped the world with their will. Apart from having generally higher development rank than most other classes, a Prestige Class will often come with powerful passive and active abilities, the Champion having its stats boosted while fighting alone for example, that makes it easier for them to slay enemies and level up quicker. As Prestige Classes are so rare, enemies will have a harder time dealing with you, your abilities probably being unknown to them, and people might mistake you for another caste entirely.%%%%For 800 CP you can instead become a Paragon. Said to be the perfect class, a Paragon has an A-rank development for each stat. [Exclusive to Hero Caste Origin],,Purchased twice for each class
Labour Caste - A Respectable Fool,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Determination, courage and ferocity-the fortitude to fight against the very will of the world itself. You possess all of the mentioned in spades. This allows you to easily power through hardship after hardship, to persists doing menial tasks all your life if you must but also the will to rise above it if you wish. While this doesn’t help you make good decisions it will help you stick to whatever path you chose, come hell or high water. Truly, you are a respectable fool.,,
Labour Caste - Tools of the Trade,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,No tool is ever truly useless and every skill has their place. Now, whatever abilities you might have, you are a master at using them creatively to achieve a goal. Burn someone’s face off with that pesky Blacksmithing skill you have or use it instead to create a layer of molten armor between you and the fire attacks of your enemy, using your immunity to the heat of your own forging to counter them. Adapting what abilities you have to fit the situation has never been easier and coming up with innovative solutions on the fly is second-nature to you.,,
Labour Caste - Hero of the People,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,A true hero of the people is what you are! “What people?” you ask!? Well, that depends on a number of things. What this perk does is making it easier for you to gather the support of any group you belong to, to become an object of adoration and inspiration to those who belong to the group. A folk hero for your people. Any actions you take that could be seen to benefit the group in any way, either directly pushing their cause or indirectly helping them, will be told and spread amongst the group, the greater the action the faster this process is as well as the recognition you receive. Do something truly great, something like saving the king of your kingdom while being of the serving caste, for example, could have your status in the group elevated to that of a legend, maybe even someone to be worshipped. The kind of groups this perk covers are things like the castes here and while the group as a whole might see you as their champion, do note that individuals can still find reason to hold you in contempt and plot against you.,,
Labour Caste - Blessed by Fate,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,The very world has recognized your will to live and thrive and now seeks to make it so. Fate and chance seem to bend to your needs, making even extremely improbable situations commonplace, finding a magical amulet that allows you to disguise yourself as another class just after you set your mind on living the life of a Hero for example. With this, you could go from being a weak example of a non-combat oriented class to being stronger than most Heroes your age in less than two years, and survive the experience.,,
Hero Caste - What Makes a Hero,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Your mind is perfectly adapted to deal with the life of a Hero. Used to taking command and dealing with stressful situations, you have all you need to keep things from spiralling out of control. Furthermore, living a life of fighting and killing both nightmarish monsters and other people won’t traumatise you and you’re able to make hard decisions when needed. Just watch out, striving ever towards the ideal of the perfect Hero might very well get you killed one day...,,
Hero Caste - Passive Ability,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Each Passive Ability in this world is unique to the person possessing it, their semblance so to speak. It is decided at birth and by entering this world you would gain one, though not one of your own choosing. With this, though, you can freely decide what your passive shall be. If you’re a Thief that likes tricking people, your passive might be ‘Silver-Tongued Rogue’, allowing you to substitute your Dexterity for any and all Charisma checks. A Monk striving for harmony could have a skill that allows them to remain balanced in emotion at all times, unable to experience emotional extremes for more than a moment. Whatever it is, it should not be much more powerful or diverse than the examples offered here.%%%%If bought with Hybrid, you can buy this again to choose your second passive as well.,,Doomseeing:%%Able to see all dooms of the target: past, present, and future%%%%A Chance:%%No matter the task, there is always a possibility of success, no matter how small it may be
Hero Caste - Tier+ Class,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Amongst all different classes there is one universal truth. Some are just plain better, they could be said to be a ‘Tier’ or two higher than others, having generally higher development potential. To avoid forcing your hand when picking a class, or for those who strive ever towards greater strength, there is this option. Whatever Class you are, all of your Stats receive one rank up, going from AS or DC and the like. This can only be bought once.,,
Hero Caste - The Path of the Jumper,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Every Class has different ‘paths’ that they can follow. A Warrior in heavy armor and with a shield and sword might find themselves developing skills such as ‘Shield Strike’ or ‘Steel Wall’ while one in leather armor and wielding a two-handed sword could gain ‘Mighty Blow’ or ‘Cleave’. The more a Hero sticks to one path and the further along it they travel the more abilities related to it they gain, and the harder it becomes for them to focus on something else without cripelling their fighting ability... For you, this is no longer true. Not only do you develop skills and abilities related to your current path much quicker than before, but if you change your path you will not lose what you have already gained or have a harder time learning something else, essentially meaning you’ll always be able to travel down all ‘skill-trees’ your class offers you. Your path even seems to predict the future for you sometimes, as you’ll consistently develop skills right before they are needed.,,
Noble Caste - Opportunistic,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Like a shark smelling blood in the water you have an unnatural sense for sniffing out opportunities to advance any goal you can think of. You’re also especially gifted with feeling and controlling the flow of politics, who is in favor with the King or not and whose bastard just moved back to the city or so. This will serve you well in your new profession.,,
Noble Caste - Always Calm,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,A Noble has responsibilities dealing with things on a level far beyond the common man’s troubles. They most always remain calm and keep up their Noble appearance. This has led to you developing a perfect poker face, able to remain unflappable in any situation, always seeming to be in control and in the know of what is going on.,,
Noble Caste - Someone of Importance,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The thing that separates you from the masses is that you are actually important. People can see this just by looking at you, the way you move and act and just your general aura screaming of a person of great power and influence. This means that you’ll almost always be seen as too important to be killed, held alive in case someone can pay your ransom or you can help those that bested you reach their goal, or maybe just for curiosity of your origin? That is-if they can even bring themselves to raise arms against you, your superiority and right to rule already being felt intrinsically by those lesser than you before you fracture in your charisma. Only people of similar or more importance will ever think much about killing you, unless you give the person in question a lot of really good reasons and motivation to kill you, and even then they might find you more useful alive as a tool to be used by them.,,
Noble Caste - The Gap Between Us,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,When two forces of equal strength clash they cancel each other out. When one of the forces is stronger though, it can push the other force back and suppress it. As a Noble you are used to standing above most others. Whenever you have an advantage in Stats or ability over someone this perk increases the advantage you would have and makes you very aware of it. Having more Constitution than the Strength of the Warrior bearing down on you would make his attacks fall even weaker upon your frame. Being better at swordplay or smarter than your opponent would make it even easier for you to outclass them. With a high enough Charisma you could probably force someone to step into a fire, or an army to lay down their weapons, if they could all hear you that is. This perk doubles the advantage you would get and when facing those much weaker than yourself, they truly stand no chance.,,
Here Rests My Heart,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,A home of your own, where you can rest your weary heart from the troubles of the outside world. It’s state depends on your Caste but it will be superior to what most others of your Caste can enjoy.%%%%Labour: a small and homely cottage, perhaps close to a lake.%%%%Hero: a larger house with several floors, bedrooms for family and guests, an armory, trophy hall and training areas both inside and outside.%%%%Noble: a mansion surrounded by a large well-maintained lawn with fences and hedges, probably staffed by unusually high leveled cooks and other NPC:s.%%%%King: a palace, fit for a king. Its theme can be decided by you but it will be a magnificent and glorious building able to house hundreds of people if need be. Everything the other houses can be said to have this can and will surpass several times over.,,
Whisper Stones,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Communication crystals that can connect to other such crystals over a distance of approximately one kilometer, good for worlds without telephones or going inconspicuous. You gain 8 to begin with and the knowledge of how to create more from stones or gemstones. The quality of the stone (or gemstone) dictates how far it can work, with the possibility of surpassing the range described here.,,
Class Catalogue,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This nifty little item is a catalogue of the different classes known to the kingdoms. It contains information of their stat distribution, skills, typical behavior, natural enemy/prey, classes they work well with, notable figures of the class and some personal information about them, etc. It will update to contain information on new classes you encounter as well.,,
Status Card,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,An old scroll (no not that kind of scroll). The parchment seems ravaged by time but still holding. The scroll saves the Statuses of people touching it, skin is required. By touching it and willing so you can show their name, class, level, stats, ranks, passive abilities and skills, what they were at the time they touched it.,,
The Pauper’s Envy,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,What you receive here is nothing less than a full set of equipment fit for a Hero of high level, about 3-5 armor pieces and a weapon or two (the amount deciding the quality). Examples of what could be found; a pair of boots that enhances your speed and also creates a small tornado around you in the air when you run that provides protection against projectiles and small foes or a sword that freezes enemies on contact (how much depending on how hard you hit them). The weapons and armor are also generally of a very high quality. If you forgo all other weapon pieces you can instead choose a staff (or other weapon) made out of Ironwood, allowing far superior spellcasting (or skill usage) than most other staves.,,Staff selected
Dungeons on Demand,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Small glass globes, containing a swirling and twitching darkness inside of them. When thrown to the ground, a Dungeon will appear. You can, before throwing them, decide how dangerous the Dungeon will be, up to 10 levels above your own that forms the number in the middle of the globe. They can be filled with either Grimm or monsters inherent to your current world. You start with five of these and will gain five more weekly, they can be stocked so don’t bother wasting all just because. Throwing several in the same spot will increase the amount of floors in the Dungeon, without changing its general difficulty. Just like the Dungeons of this world, they will disappear after the Dungeon has been ‘cleared’.,,
Instrument of Bestowal,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Taking the form of a crystal ball this item can be used for very little here. The reason for that is that its abilities require something this world doesn’t have, class-less people. With this, you can give people in future worlds classes that fits what role they want to fill or the one they are best fit to fill, if they won’t pick themselves. Not everyone will have the potential to become Prestige classes, be aware of that, and while this does make their Name and Occupation (their Class) hover in the air above their heads, only other people with classes like the ones bestowed by this item (and you) will be able to see that.,,
Labour Caste - A Familiar Weight,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,The tools of your trade. The smith’s hammer, the butcher’s knife, the farmer’s scythe, a tool fitting of whatever Labour Caste class you bought here, or one freely chosen amongst them if you’re from another Caste. It will never break and will shift over time into a more beautiful example of its origin, though a simpler look is always possible if you want it. If bought with Summon Establishment, this is upgraded with the ability to shift similarly to that Item.,,
Labour Caste - Item of Disguise,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,An item of your choice that lets you assume a different class name in this world, comes free of any demonic taint! The item is very unassuming and most people will easily gloss over it, finding it to be of no note. In future jumps this lets you assume the guise of another part of society, change your clothes and look to match a soldier, a banker, a farmer. This won’t change your appearance too much, people who know you would still be capable of recognizing you, but to those unfamiliar with your face you would appear as just another person of the class/role you’re disguising yourself as. Can change your apparent race to that of another humanoid if those exist in your current setting, though your general features will still remain and your abilities won’t change (you’ll just look like Orc-Jumper or Dwarf-jumper now).,,
Labour Caste - Summon Establishment,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,It’s very annoying that you always have to sneak away to get some smithing done right? With this Item that won’t be a problem anymore. It can take the form of any establishment fitting of the Labour Caste classes found here, appearing as a smithy, a shop-stall, an Inn, etc. Able to be called into the world at will, containing all you could need to fulfill the role the establishment has shifted to fit, food and wares will have to be procured by you though as only tools and other objects needed to practice your craft appear (and will disappear when you dismiss this). It will change its look and the quality of what is summoned as you progress along the particular path you want to use it for, being a better blacksmith will net you a better smithy, but can always assume a simpler look if you wish it so. It can be called into the world anywhere as long as there’s enough place for it and can be dismissed immediately when you so will it, fading as a mirage. If it’s destroyed you can simply dismiss the pieces and summon it again later.,,
Labour Caste - Rare Materials,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,In this Jump you gain a heap of rare materials that your class could utilize, if your particular class is not one capable of creating items or building things then you gain lots of extremely-valuable trade goods instead. Every time you go to a new Jump you can designate this item for a role such as a Tailor or a Blacksmith and then get a large amount, enough to make a couple of armor sets and accompanying weaponry, of the rarest possible materials that the role could work with in the setting, whether that be ning-indestructible metal from outer space or the fur of a legendary beast lost to time. You can choose to have this split itself between different kinds of materials if you wish it so, gaining some of the mentioned metal and fur but less of each than if you picked only one of them.,,
Hero Caste - Guildhall,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,The perfect place for a Hero to rest after a long and trying Quest. This Guildhall is large enough for eight people to live comfortably together, one bedroom each, and will always bestow everyone in it with warm feelings of home and comfort. Tensions rarely linger here, conflicts being resolved fast without too much drama, and people also seem to recover from physical wounds quicker as well. In future jumps this building can become an add-on to the warehouse or be brought into a place of your choice in the outside world, with the land around it being owned by you.,,
Hero Caste - Magical Map,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Map shows your surroundings, ten kilometers in every direction, and whatever Dungeons that exist in the area. It shifts to mirror changes in the real world and can be tied to certain items or people to have them show up as markers on the map, works by touching the map to the object or person and reciting a short incantation. Marks other locations of great treasure in future jumps.%%%%If bought with Fifth Kingdom, you get an additional map that shows the entirety of your kingdom.,,
Hero Caste - Amulet of Progression,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,A strange, totemic, amulet that seems to hum with some mysterious energy whenever you or someone else touches it. It has one very simple, but also quite powerful ability to help you on your travels here. It will triple the experience (Exp) you gain, from any source. When you forge something in your smithy or kill a beast this amulet will activate, humming once again, and magnifying the experience you gained. It also gives you a weak but noticeable sense for where to find sources of great exp for your current class and path, whether that be a mine filled with rich and rare minerals or the burrow of terrible monsters. Listen to this sense with caution...,,
Hero Caste - Starmetal Weapon,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,A weapon of your choice made out of Starmetal. The material that makes up this weapon was brought to Remnant by a man making a wish by a demon. Naturally the demon twisted his wish and killed him with it, but the material remained. The material is crystalline in appearance and looks cold to the touch while also being both incredibly sharp and nearly indestructible. It’s a perfect weapon for a perfect fighter and no other weapon like this exists on Remnant, at least not yet. With this, you might even be capable of killing a god, or the demonic equivalent of one...,,
Noble Caste - Fine Clothes,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,If you're going to be a Noble you might as well look the part. With this purchase, you will receive dozens of tasteful outfits, all expensive beyond compare and looking the part, for different occasions. Wearing one of these is a perfect way of flaunting your great wealth and power, while also showing your great taste in clothing. The outfits are self-cleaning and repairing and in any future jump you travel to, you will gain new similar outfits to be added to your collection, fitting of the setting.,,
Noble Caste - A Royal Message,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Taking the form of a necklace this item could help your voice reach an entire city at once, such is the sheer volume of your speech when you put it on. A king could address all the people of his city at once, or command his and the enemy army to stand down. So powerful is your voice that this could be used for offensive purposes against people close to you, just talking normally being enough to have them grip their heads in pain. If you don’t want to deafen anyone, know that you can willingly control the volume of your voice, anywhere from your usual to the maximum capabilities of the necklace as described above.,,
Noble Caste - Jumper’s Vault,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Containing the loot of several dungeons, this vault holds treasures fit for one of your wealth and status. The inside of the vault is inscribed with thousands upon thousands of runes, covering every available surface and protecting it from any intrusion. For most the only way to enter the vault is through the front door and only with the key that you possess. The loot it contains will shift to fit the current setting but it will never downgrade from what can be found here, which means you will at least always be in possession of several powerful magical items and artefacts, and the runes stay.%%%%If bought with Fifth Kingdom, this is upgraded to contain as much loot as Beacon’s Vault, more than enough to outfit a sizable army.,,
Noble Caste - Fifth Kingdom,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,Perhaps, when the first King created the four kingdoms and established the caste system to protect the people of Remnant from the Grimm he created a fifth? Maybe this kingdom grew over the years from small independent settlements and tribes? Or maybe it existed before the others, separated from the rest. Whichever way it is, up for you to decide, this kingdom exists now and you are its leader, its King, even if you happen to be a Labour Caste member. In future Jumps this kingdom can be imported similarly, the culture dependent upon your own wishes.,,
Guild Members,,3,,00,,False,,False,,This option allows you to import up to three companions for free or create new ones, to join you in this world. By paying 50 Cp each, you can import or create additional companions. All companions that join you in this world thanks to this option will receive 1000 CP and can take Drawbacks for additional CP. The Drawbacks ‘War on Remnant’ and ‘Evil Incarnate’ can not be taken by Companions.,,
New Allies,,3,,-500,,False,,True,,Someone in this world caught your eye? By picking this option you will gain the chance to take them with you on your journey, though you’ll still have to convince them to come with you. You will be guaranteed to meet with them multiple times during your time here, your fates being intertwined so to speak. Be careful not to pick anyone too dangerous now...,,
Level One,,4,,00,,False,,False,,If you wish, you could choose to start your journey earlier, at the date of your birth in this world. You would be Level 1 and will leave the jump when you usually would have.,,
Canon Character,,4,,00,,False,,False,,If you choose the right Class you can choose to insert yourself into the place of a canon character! Remember that for some, like Jaune, this brings extra danger (as he is currently under the curse of his own wish and is destined to die).,,
Golden Age,,4,,00,,False,,False,,If you want to start your journey in this world earlier, so be it. Rescue a young druid from his traditionalistic tribe, go to combat school with a certain elementalist or fight side by side with the king of Ashari against the invaders of his lands. You may, if you want, extend your time in this jump so that you will leave at the time you otherwise would’ve. Though do note that depending on how far back you start, this might be hundreds of years.,,
Noble’s Bastard,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Labour Caste only%%%%The nail that sticks up, that’s you. You’re the bastard of some Noble family from whatever Kingdom you live in. The family see you as a terrible embarrassament and you were banished from the city/village they hail from. Other Nobles, allies or enemies of your family, will seek to use you to their needs if they learn the truth of who you are.,,
Soldier Caste,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Hero Caste only%%%%You failed your first Quest (or the equivalent for it in your home Kingdom) and were knocked down to the Soldier Caste. Apart from the stigma of not being good enough to be a Hero, if a war breaks out you will be expected to fight in it, which, in all fairness, might be an excellent way for you to gain more exp...,,
Troublesome Responsibility,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Noble Caste only%%%%Whatever area you rule over seems to be cursed with bad luck. Crop harvests each year suffer from bad weather and animal attacks, buildings are frequently damaged or destroyed and Grimm and banditry seek out your village(s) like moths to a flame. Ignoring your responsibilities will reward you with the ire of both your people and your king.,,
Prejudice and more Prejudice,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,If something is stolen, it’s the Thief’s fault. If someone dies, surely the Assassin is behind it. Knights in shining armor? Everyone knows they’re all arrogant and bloodthirsty glory hounds. Whatever Class you have, people always seem to base their first impression of you upon the negative stereotypes associated with your Class and the Caste it belongs to. This impression can be changed, especially if you're dealing with understanding people, but for most this would take something definite like weeks of interaction or saving their life once or twice.,,
Exp Addiction,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Arrogance, overconfidence, bloodthirst. All of these are easy to fall into with an affliction such as yours. You crave the feeling of gaining Exp, of levelling up and feeling yourself grow stronger. Better than food, sex or love-killing something and feeling its strength become apart of you is now your greatest vice. Watch out what you do with this Jumper, the fastest way of gaining experience is by killing other people after all...,,
Debt to TRE,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Or whoever fits the bill best, depending on your personal strength and starting location. You are in debt to someone. It will take you, whoever you might be, serious work to rid yourself of the debt and no matter who you are, ignoring it will come with consequences. The person or organisation who owns your debt will also do what they can to ensure you stay in debt.,,
Stagnation,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,One of your Stats has a Rank of X, meaning it never increases despite how much you lvl up. This means you will have a score of around 5 in one of your stats, a large disadvantage than only growing the more you lvl up, compared to your peers that is. After this Jump is over you will receive a stat increase equal to what you missed out on by taking this Drawback.,,
Greycloak Wanted,,4,,6000,,True,,False,,The Greycloaks, a shadowy organisation causing chaos and death all over Remnant, are now interested in you, trying to capture or kill you for one purpose or another. Perhaps they think you hold the secret to making a wish of the demon without it using it to kill them. Maybe their leader wants to use your talents for her own machinations. Or, it could also just be that you pissed them off. Whatever it is, expect them to start out with only sending a couple of members after you but know that they will escalate if they see they aren’t making much progress.,,Retail Rocker
Dark Secret,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Perhaps you are a Labour Caste member who sneaked into a combat school, disguised as another class. Perhaps you broke the Grand Treaty and have people hunting you down. Either way you have a secret that, if found out, can have grave consequences on your everyday life. This Drawback ensures that circumstances will line up so that the secret will be in danger of being discovered multiple times each year, both by those close to you and by your enemies.,,
Forsaken,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,A truly terrible fate has befallen you Jumper. What awaits you in this world is now complete isolation for all who recognize you, which in this case now means more than 90% of the civilised world. You have committed some great crime against one of the kingdoms, or more, and no amount of atonement can ever lift your judgement. You will be ignored by everyone, they won’t sell you food, allow you to rent a room for the night or help you if you’re attacked by Grimm. If you try to enter settlements and make a ruckus of yourself, the kingdom will send their strongest Heroes to hunt you down, to either execute you or throw you out into the wilderness again. A fate such as this could drive anyone mad...,,
Maddening Whispers,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,For some unexplained reason, you have a mental connection to the wish-granting demon mentioned far above. Your every wish can be granted to you if you so want it, but if you wish for even one thing, it will mean the end of you, no matter what clever word-games you try to come up with. Your mind is constantly barraged by whispers of the things it could grant you, and your dreams filled with visions of the things you could have. Every loss, every setback you will have to face while the demon offers you to make it right. Try to endure ten years, or more, of this Jumper. Good luck.,,
Believe in Destiny,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,No matter your circumstances you are now destined for greatness. Fortune, death and danger come hand in hand as you’re thrown from one continental disaster to the next. Wherever you go, plots to overthrow the government are suddenly put into action and dangerous beasts who have slept for hundreds of years awaken to take their toll on humanity. With this, you’ll know no peace here in this world and though the opportunity for greatness is but yours to grasp... you’ll have to fight tooth and nail to survive the experience, and all the attention your rise will surely attract.,,
War on Remnant,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,The Grand Treaty is broken, dead, dust in the wind. When a war starts, and I assure you, they will, you can be sure that the opposing sides will bring their strongest heroes into the conflict. There will be bloodshed, the heroes of these wars slaughtering their way through each other and those weaker than them, and while humanity’s greatest defenders are busy killing or being killed... the Grimm will be sure to take care of the rest, the negativity generated by these conflicts seeing their numbers rise as never before.,,
Evil Incarnate,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,What fool could have done this? The dark goddess Salem, origin and master of the Grimm, now walks amongst you. Someone wished her into existence in hopes of killing her for her strength, and they failed. All of Remnant is now in danger and if the kingdoms can’t put their differences aside and work together to face this threat the world might very well be lost, maybe even if they do...,,
Classless,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,The one thing that sets this world apart from so many others and you don’t want to take part in it? Really? Okay then, you are now classless, no words hovering in the air above you. You are the only human or faunus in this world that has this condition and as such people will fear you. By many you will be seen as an anomaly, maybe even an abomination, a Grimm in the guise of a human stalking the land maybe? Others might find their thoughts drifting in even darker directions, thinking of what different class-less humanoids they have seen, thinking you a servant of Salem or a thing like her. The good note is that you will receive all the benefits of your class and any class-related perks after this jump is over and that you can still use powers and abilities from other worlds here, just not take part in the class system. Maybe you can convince people that you are a god?,,
“A Mage and their Sentinel”,,5,,5000,,False,,True,,Requires: Location-Atlas, Origin-Hero Caste, Class: Any Magic or Melee Class.%%%%This is a story of love, whether that be the romantic kind or the love you hold for the friend closest to your heart. The person you will meet here will truly become your closest ally, someone who understands you and who you are perfectly, but I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me first explain something about the society in Atlas. As mentioned above, it is a Magocracy, where mages make up the ruling class, substituting the role of the Nobles. To protect the mages, other members of the Hero-Caste assume the role of Sentinels. Sentinels stay close to their mages’ side and protect them from danger from danger while they cast their spells or just go about their daily lives, essentially specifically chosen bodyguards. By becoming a Sentinel the Hero’s role in society is elevated above other unchosen heroes, how much depends on the political power of their Mage.%%%%Depending on what class you are, you will either become the Mage or the Sentinel in this relationship. You start on the day of the choosing, either choosing yourself or being chosen depending on your class, and your task in this scenario is simple. Whether it be rivals seeking your companion’s heart, grand conspiracies threatening the organizations you belong to or simply monsters seeking to tear your bond apart through the finality of death, you will face seemingly countless challenges to your bond. Despite all of this the two of you must rise to prominence as the greatest pair of a mage and sentinel in all of Atlas.%%%%Reward: Sentinel/Mage Companion%%An actual mental bond between the two of you, just as the myth goes, allowing you to always know where your Sentinel/Mage is. It allows you to feel what they are feeling and makes it possible for you to send thoughts to each other, essentially having a mental conversation. The friendship the two of you share also becomes a fundamental part of the world, unchangeable by the wills of others. Plots to turn the two of you against each other, abilities that manipulate the mind used to force you two to fight, all of these and more are like ants trying to move the mountain that is your friendship.,,
~With Kindness~,,5,,5000,,True,,True,,Requires: None%%%%The world can be a nasty place. You know it, I know it, we all know it. Many suffer and amongst them there are a few who suffer more than most others, the Forsaken. Fallen from grace, these individuals have betrayed their kingdom, committed crimes so great that no atonement could ever wash it away. To be forsaken is to be forgotten, stripped from the pages of the history books and cast into ignominy.%%%%One such individual is Tyrian Callows. He served his kingdom, Mistral, dutifully for many years as the bodyguard of the queen and a defender of the people, helping everyone no matter which caste they belonged to. Eventually though, he made a mistake, more of his charge’s fault really but that didn’t matter to the kingdom. The queen died and Tyrian was forsaken. The people he had saved time after time turned their backs on him as he laid starving, dying, in the streets. For years he was subjected to absolute isolation and this drove him mad. Eventually he would strive for what his twisted mind thought of as salvation, and once again would be betrayed and suffer at the hands of those he trusted.%%%%This is his story, or it would be if not for you Jumper. Taking this scenario allows you to start your journey in this world a couple of years earlier, and to stay until when your jump would otherwise have ended if you wish. Your task is simple: find Tyrian, show him kindness and give him a new purpose in this life, let him find his salvation in serving you. Do this and you will have his absolute loyalty and eternal gratitude. Many will turn against you if you do this though, it being a strong taboo to interact with the forsaken, much less take them in. You and him will be the nails that stick up and many will seek to hammer you down, most of them being Mistralian nobles and heroes. Survive through the jump and make sure your new friend survives with you to receive your reward.%%%%Reward:%%For completing your task you will be rewarded two-fold. First of all you’ll be able to take Tyrian with you as a Companion. Tyrian is of the Paragon Class, a scorpion-faunus and an all-around brilliant and high-leveled combatant from his life of servitude to Mistral. For the things you have done for him, he would gladly follow you to the end of this universe, or the next...%%%%Your second reward is this: in future jumps you will be able to easily find and recognize people akin to the Forsaken in this world. Outcasts, those abandoned, exiled, these people will often be purposelessly adrift in the world, seeking redemption or salvation from any who could give it. Your ability to resonate with these people, to get them to trust you and to win their loyalty has skyrocketed. You can give them a better life, whether that be through helping them find their way back to society or by having them join your retinue. These people will always at the very least remember you fondly, as the person who changed their life, and many will hold a deep-rooted loyalty for you even after decades of not interacting with you if you show them your kindness.,,
Godslayer,,5,,5000,,True,,True,,Requires: None%%%%With this Scenario, you take on the ambition of someone else in this world, mirroring their goal but with a chance for a greater reward. The goal that this person has, and the one that you will now share, is to force the goddess of the grimm, Salem, to fully incarnate in the world, becoming something that can be slain for exp, and then to kill her. Whichever way you choose to do this, forcing her into this world weak and vulnerable through a perfectly constructed wish or by picking a certain Drawback, you will face additional troubles. While before only you and one other shared this wish the world has changed to accomodate for dozens of hopeful god-slayers. All from different walks of lives (Nobles, Heroes, NPCs) and all with different motives and approaches to their task, these people will compete with you for the grand price.%%%%For taking on this additional danger, when before you could have done much the same without the threat of so many others hounding your steps, you will receive a very special reward when you run the dark queen through!%%%%Reward:%%Apart from all the Exp you will gain from killing the strongest being in existence, you will get something to help you replicate this feat in future worlds. A special, multi-dimensional, rune that can be applied to any weapon you hold in your hand (while you still hold it) and which allows the weapon to kill anything. A killing blow dealt by this will ensure that the target stays dead no matter what regenerative or other unnatural abilities it has to stay alive/revive itself with. You will still need the strength and skill to deal a blow capable of killing the creature before you, their natural defenses still being as strong as ever, but when done with this weapon, they are assured to not recover or rise again.,,
Demonic Pact,,5,,5000,,False,,True,,Requires: Can’t pick the ‘Evil Incarnate’ Drawback%%%%For embarking upon this path, your rewards will be numerous, Jumper. But is it truly worth the price? You have turned your back on the light of the world and embraced its darkness, swearing yourself to the service of the Demonic Goddess Salem. Your task will be to help her complete the wishes of those who summon her, though after Salem has twisted their words to the absolute worst meaning for them and humanity as a whole. For ten years this is your task, and despite your or others interference with the world or Salem you will have to constantly answer these wishes (at least one once a month).%%%%You will eventually become recognized as a servant of the demon and will have heroes grouping up to hunt you down, and perhaps other perils such as a certain group of lawless criminals taking an interest in someone with a direct connection to the strongest being in the world. Survive for ten years and your toiling will result in a reward..%%%%Reward:%%You are able to curse places, centers of a lot of negativity, to cause them to start spawning Grimm. These Grimm will follow your command when you are close but will otherwise hunt down people and kill them. These areas will spawn more Grimm the more negativity that has permeated them, a battlefield where thousands died being a prime place to curse for example, but new negativity will also give a temporary boost to the spawn-rate.%%%%Your second reward is the ability to assume a form like the one Merlot got through his wish, able to transform all the Grimm in an area about as large as a mountain into black mist that seeps into you and empowers you. This new form, one you can decide the shape of each time you do this, will hold the combined strength of all Grimm absorbed and can also be healed by absorbing more Grimm, its max-size is decided by how many Grimm you absorbed. When you let the form go you will return to human, without any wounds that might have been dealt to your Grimm form, and any leftover Grimm-mass can be transformed into new Grimm around you.,,
To Break Free,,5,,5000,,False,,True,,Requires: Labour Caste%%%%God knows they want to break free, that toiling Labour Caste placed at the bottom of the social ladder...%%%%Or, at least they would if they knew the truth behind the rigidness of the Caste System. The reason why Nobles enforce the idea that Labour Caste members, or NPCs, need to be protected and kept away from danger is that danger is a great source of potential exp and leveling, and a levelled Labour Caste will have a high Res-stat, allowing them to resist the charisma of the Nobles. While Heroes are strong, their often abysmal Res-rank means that even at a high level the nobles can still control and manipulate them.%%%%This is many times to the detriment of all, for example why should Nobles be the sole voice in matters of agriculture when they know not the intricacies of farming? Why should your Caste exist only to provide things the other Castes need or want? For the Labour Caste it’s time to break free of the chains imposed upon them by the caste system, to deliver unto this world a new Dawn! Your purpose in this scenario is simple in concept: abolish the caste system, destroy the current world order and create a more equal world. Be the very person the Nobles feared Jaune to be.%%%%Reward:%%You are able to sense systemic oppression, injustices and inequality, perfectly understanding the system and the reason for its fault by encountering it once, encountering being meeting a member of the oppressed group and talking with them about it for example.%%%%Furthermore your ability to rouse opposition against such a system races past the line of the supernatural. Even if the oppressed people were kept apart and with a history of living under the system centuries long, your words would light a fire in their heart and that fire would spread through word of mouth quicker than what should be possible. Even if your revolution had no way of communicating between groups or giving out commands they would act like an expertly organised group, subconsciously sharing strategy and plans.,,
Whispers of the Past,,5,,5000,,False,,True,,Requires: Necromancer Class%%%%Many of the Classes that exist today, the Archer, the Mage, the Warrior, are all remnants of bygone times, those that survived thousands of years of natural selection in this cruel world. The weakest classes, the Tier 3’s so to speak, died out over the years, failing to pass on their lines. Sometimes though, it wasn’t the harshness of the world but humanity itself that led to the extinction of a class...%%%%Such is the case for the Necromancer class. For unexplained reasons, maybe just fear and superstition or possibly something as grand as a war between the living and the dead, the kingdoms banished or killed all belonging to this class eons ago.%%%%Your task in this world will be to find the tribes of Necromancers that survived outside of the kingdoms and to gather them, to unite your people. This first part of your quest will take you all over the world and will require much from you, both in surviving the harshness of the lands outside of the kingdoms and convincing the Necromancers you find to give up the safety of their solitude and join you.%%%%When you have gathered as many Necromancers as possible your next task comes into play. You’ll have to convince the Kingdoms, or at least one of them, to lift the ban on necromancy and welcome those you have gathered back into civilization. This can be done peacefully, but raising an army with the help of your comrades and marching on the capitals is also an option.%%%%When you have managed this it is up to you to ensure that no one threatens your people’s new sanctuary, whether that be another kingdom declaring war on the one that houses you or any shadowy organisations working to eradicate you all. Do this and you will receive your Reward...%%%%Reward:%%Depending on which route you picked you will gain different Rewards.%%%%Peaceful - As a reward for making the Necromancer class, once hated or feared by all, accepted in society you will find it much easier to replicate this feat in future worlds. Getting society as a whole to accept and stop discriminating against groups of people is something you will always be able to make good progress with, your message spreading and finding support almost faster than you can handle. Whenever you try to ‘save’ a group such as this, fate will stand behind you, especially strong if you already have perks that alter destiny and chance in your favor.%%%%Conquest - By choosing the road of conquest and domination you will receive a fitting reward. Your Necromantic powers, the skills and abilities of your Class, are all greatly enhanced (a x5 multiplier added after accounting for your lvl and stats) and you also gain an supernatural sense which helps you find the corpses of powerful individuals, an internal compass that points you towards their resting place, though it doesn’t make you aware of any protections guarding them...,,
