Beta,,0,,-500,,True,,False,,The local iteration of you was one of the Beta players, and already has a wealth of knowledge and experience with MMOs, VR, and SAO in particular.,,

Flourishes,,1,,00,,True,,True,,This doesn’t make you any better with their practical usage, but when using a weapon or tool, you know how to make it look good­ especially when you draw or holster it.%%%%Good for drawing attention.,,
In a Game,,1,,00,,True,,False,,While you’re in the game Sword Art Online, regardless of if you purchased the relevant perks, things like Switch!

Sweet Sword,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,An ornate, nigh­indestructible sword. On the plus side, it’s not going to break or even need maintenance. On the negative side, it’ll be really hard to improve it.,,
Sturdy Shield,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,What the hell is this thing made out of? On it’s own, it’s an excellent shield, withstanding great force. Wielded by you as a shield, it uses your own acquired immunities and applies them to itself twice over.,,
