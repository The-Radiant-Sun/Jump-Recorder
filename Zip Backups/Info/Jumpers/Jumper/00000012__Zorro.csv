Universal Drawbacks,,6,,105000,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,4,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Time and Place,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The time of your arrival is sometime in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the place is California, the town of San Gabriel where the story of Zorro is set.,,
Age and Gender,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Roll 1d15+25 for your age. Your gender remains as it is. If you want you may pick either for 50 CP.,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You’re a complete unknown on the scene, with no previously existing enemies. No preexisting friends either, though.,,
Hidalgo,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Much like a certain Don you might know of, you’re the scion of an old, established spanish family having found fortune in this country. A decent chunk of wealth and respect at your back, and quite possibly much more to come if you play your cards right.,,
Priest,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Or you might have dedicated your life to religion, a long time ago. Whether or not you secretly help out folk heroes oppose oppression and cruelty is up to you.,,
Administrator,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Or you might be a part of the colonial government, answering to the Governor of Alta California. Maybe you’re a part of the soldiery, or the governor’s own office... the details are yours to determine, really.,,
Drop In - That Spanish Beauty,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Well, maybe not spanish, strictly. But you are a phenomenally good-looking young man/woman, all broad shoulders and dainty features, enough to be a figure of dreams and imagination after a single look.%%%%The exact details of your complexion and stuff is up to you, of course, but however you look, you look great.,,
Drop In - Outlaw,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Really? I suppose Zorro was a bandit. So now you’re too! You have all the skills and talent needed to be a phenomenal criminal of various shades. From banditry to thievery to cattle rustling and a host of other similar professions, you have all it takes to be one of the greatest outlaws of the day and age.%%%%Your skills with guns and cattle and all the other prerequisites for the art are similarly magnificent, as is your ability to intimidate and coerce people. Outlaws aren’t nice, y’know.,,
Drop In - The Legend,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,There can be a dime a dozen would-be swashbucklers, seducers of women, bandits and whatnot. But there was only one Diego de la Vega, El Zorro. There’s a reason for that, a certain je ne sais quoi, if you’ll forgive using french in a spanish context.%%%%You have that same thing now. There’s something about you, some air or charisma or talent that makes your actions and your words, everything you do take a degree of dramatic flair that’s simply unmatched. You do things in ways no one can quite match, and even when you don’t it strikes people as such all the same!%%%%In a very short time you find stories about your deeds spreading like wildfire, growing with every retelling until you could gain the fascination of whole civilizations, your tales having gained a life of their own. Furthermore, you can control this, picking which stories get to be dominant and which remain obscure and unknown or just turning the effect off for a while.%%%%In future jumps too, you can import this Legend ready-made, deeds of previous jumps inserting themselves as old stories in the backdrop of a setting, along with new ones springing up around you day by day.,,
Drop In - Secret Socialite,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,This day and age is rife with secret societies and organizations of all shades and stripes, above and beyond what you would imagine even from a 21st century that is a conspiracy theorist’s delight. La Justicia, the Knights of Aragon, those are just two examples, one for both sides of the equation.%%%%And now you can join the number! You have all the talents and skills needed to be a part, or even a founder of such organization. You swim in the waters of intrigue and scheming. You know how to recruit people to your cause, how to get them to truly believe in it, how to set up secret bases and passphrases, and all the rest.%%%%It can be of any kind you like, from the freedom and goodness supporting kind that’s La Justicia or a force aimed simply at accumulating power, like the Knights. But you know just how to talk people into either, from young hotheads ready for mystery and adventure to established statesmen wanting to further their power and influence.,,
Hidalgo - Seducer,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It can be of any kind you like, from the freedom and goodness supporting kind that’s La Justicia or a force aimed simply at accumulating power, like the Knights. But you know just how to talk people into either, from young hotheads ready for mystery and adventure to established statesmen wanting to further their power and influence.%%%%Marriage, pre-existing commitment, ‘love’, nothing seems to be able to prevent you from getting into the pants of anyone you set your mind to, and worse, none of your partners ever seems to mind when you make new ones!%%%%It’s really rather disconcerting.,,
Hidalgo - The Nobleman’s Education,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Well, you do need this, no need to bother pretending otherwise. You now have all the elaborate skills and manners needed to be a members of even the highest courts in Europe. While you’re focused on Spanish for obvious reasons, you speak at least half a dozen other languages, always know which spoon is for what, and never forget the right way to dree or treat people of varying social stations.%%%%In the event that you’re in a situation you don’t know the right menners in, you find that you can learn very, very quickly. It takes you days and weeks to master new languages, and hours to perfect complicated dances is the level we’re talking here.,,
Hidalgo - Heir of the Wolf,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The woman who became Regina de la Vega, mother to Zorro, was first Toypurnia, Daughter-of-Wolf. She united dozens of feuding native american tribes and led them in an attempt to oust the spanish colonists, all through the sheer force of her will and charisma.%%%%You have that same charisma now. It’s almost supernatural, the way you can take command of just about any situation. People tend to view you as a larger-than-life figure, and instinctively prefer you for any given leadership position.%%%%You rise rapidly in any hierarchy you’re part of, though the rate tends to slow down the higher you rise. In addition, you have a natural flair for command and leadership too, being able to direct raids and battles with a deft hand few can ever match. This doesn’t quite extend to leading armies, to be honest, remaining limited for the most part to only whatever numbers you can reach personally, even if it’s just standing in front of a crowd and rallying them.%%%%But in that number, you can incite almost a fanatical devotion with your presence and actions, having almost a supernatural gift of animal magnetism.,,
Hidalgo - Swordsman,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Ah. Well, you didn’t think we’d leave out this, did you? Simply put, you’re right at the edge of being utterly superhuman, when it comes to your body. Your physique is exemplary, such that you could win Olympic golds in not one but all categories with even the barest training.%%%%Speaking of which, the place this shows the best is in fighting. Despite the name, you’re an absolute demon when it comes to unarmed as well as armed combat. The martial arts of the far east may be unknown to you in California (or they might not), but you would have a superb talent for them all the same.%%%%You can master in days and weeks what it normally takes people years to get proficient in, particularly when it comes to any form of swordsmanship. You start out a genius with every form of blade used in Europe in this time, along with every form of unarmed combat, mounted or otherwise. Seriously, you’re deadly.,,
Priest - Priestly Skills,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,So religion has it’s problems, but you can’t exactly deny its importance in things, can you? Which is why you should know what you’re talking about. You’re an expert now not only in the myriad traditions and rituals of Catholic Christianity, but also the various traditions and symboligies of the Native American tribes in this part of the world.%%%%You know what totem symbolizes what, how to behave in various situations ranging from a christian funeral to a tribal campfire and everything in between. In addition, you have a similarly vast skill at understanding new traditions and religions, whenever you’re encountered with them.,,
Priest - Beyond Suspicion,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Most priests are, really. At least until they aren’t. You haven’t reached this mark just yet, let’s just say. It might be your job or just the way you act, but people in authority simply never consider you a threat, even when you actively are one.%%%%Regardless of whether or not you’re working with their enemies, until someone gets incontrovertible proof of you acting against them, people always tend to trust that you’re an uninvolved neutral party, and even more amazing, they tend to respect this neutrality! When you actually are uninvolved, or just trying to help, the effect is even stronger, like even hostile armies or pirates would be more likely to leave you in peace than anything else.,,
Priest - Soothe the Natives,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,It takes a special calibre of man to keep tempers down in an ongoing process of colonization. On one side are the natives, barely understanding what’s going on. On the other are the colonists, far away from home and irritated and distressed about it, not to mention entitled and often actively wicked.%%%%So you being here is probably for the best. You have a gift that borders on outright mind control, when it comes to making peace and bringing about calm and harmony. Not only can you bring parties to the table simply with your genuine appeal and sincerity, you have an immense gift for bringing about deals that leave both people, if not happy, at least equally unhappy.%%%%While this is not an assurance that you can always find a way to move peacefully or that the bargains you reach will even be fair, you can always connect to people’s hearts and convince them why it’s best for them to take the path of peace instead of picking up the sharp things and the guns.,,
Priest - Art and Education,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Are really rather vital for this profession, aren’t they? Good thing you have both, and in spades. You are a phenomenal artist, first and foremost. Be it drawing, painting, singing or writing, you have the ability to take all the passion and emotion you’re supposed to repress and pour it into the art, creating works that would be feted as wonders of humanity for centuries to come.%%%%These years have many masters worth the name, but if you put in an effort you could easily be among them, a Picasso much before his day. And that’s just the art. You also have the education and knowledge that would be required to be a good priest, with a solid mastery not only of Latin but also of many Native American tongues, along with an exemplary knowledge of the sciences, history and all the rest, flawed as it might be.%%%%Finally, you’re amazing at both improving yourself in these things and passing all of this along. You can teach years worth of knowledge in weeks, and learn just as quickly. You could take uneducated brats by the dozens and turn out smart young men fit for the spanish court, all in a month.,,
Administrator - Terrifying Practices,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Seriously, who keeps a head in a jar and drinks from it? What the fuck? But that’s the kind of thing you do now, apparently. You always seem to know just how to terrify your enemies into complying with whatever your needs or demands are.%%%%Be it conducting massive genocide or just threatening it, or even something innocuous on the surface, you have a cold, harsh menace about you that you always know just how to maximise with your actions.,,
Administrator - Money Manager,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Gold. That’s what California’s all about, isn’t it? Good thing you’re a genius when it comes to managing it, then! You are what we call in scientific terms ‘absolutely genius’ with all things money. In California it means multiplying cattle numbers and crop yields, in France it might mean managing your investments, but whatever the market might consist of, you remain able to beat its pants off.%%%%Everything from being a wealthy landlord to a corporate CEO or accountant, or even managing money for a nation as a King’s Treasurer or Finance Minister is in your ballpark, and you’re nothing short of stellar at it. Money multiples under your care, seemingly getting attracted like you’re a giant gold-affecting magnet or something.,,
Administrator - Corruption and Treachery,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The tools of statecraft. Never forget, and always be good at them! Which you are, thankfully. Be it blackmailing someone, kidnapping their friends to get them to vote your way or just conspiring to steal a nation from someone with his own money, when it comes to the dirty side of politics there’s no one better than you.%%%%You can spot games of intrigue from miles away, and manipulate and fiddle with the people involved like they’re pieces on a board and you’re the player. You can raise secret armies, fund secret research to make advanced weaponry, conspire to being about new kingdoms, all in a day’s work and all to an extent hardly anyone can imagine matching.%%%%No matter what your overall goals may be, if it involves realpolitik you could teach Machiavelli a thing or two.,,
Administrator - Planning and Command,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Or you could do it the right way, one supposes. Many people can have some of the components needed to be a good ruler. Some can command the military, some can work with the traders to keep money flowing and food on tables, others have a vision and a talent for building the nation.%%%%You’re one of the very few who can do it all, and do it superbly. When it comes to being a ruler and statesman, you’re one of the very finest of all time. From diplomacy with foreign powers to building both cities and institutions, your mind works on a level hardly anyone else can comprehend.%%%%You have everything it takes to rule a land and people and bring about peace and prosperity. You can command armies and navies with the best of them to execute even the most daring or complicated strategies. You have a gift for planning and infrastructure, and most of all for the logistics of it all where you’re actually the best.%%%%You can unite varied and multicultural people, and you know how to develop a mass of villages and towns all with separate languages and customs into a Nation. It doesn’t even matter what form of government you operate in, you’re equally brilliant at them all.,,
Drop In - Pistol,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Whoo, nice! Well, not that nice. This is pretty much just a simple pistol of the kind you can find in this day and age in this world. It does have some advantages, specifically that no shots from it ever miss the target, and that it never needs any maintenance... or new bullets, for that matter.%%%%Oh, and in future jumps is evolves according to the world, becoming whatever local equivalent to an ordinary pistol there is, be it a more advanced pistol, a blaster or even a wand. It automatically gives you the skills needed to not blow your own nose off or something, but nothing further.,,
Drop In - La Justicia Badge,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Or rather, a generic badge of identity for any secret society. Well, it’s generic until you use it. This badge proves you as a member of any one of the secret societies running around here. Once used, it becomes a badge for that specific society, inapplicable on the others barring extraordinary conditions.%%%%You get one more in every future jump, all operating under the same rules.,,
Drop In - Goldmine,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Well... there’s not much else to say here. While not quite what you see in Mask of Zorro, this is a fair-sized mine, already being worked by a generic NPC force. It produces somewhere in the vicinity of fifty kilograms of gold every month.%%%%It can either be pure gold or gold alloys or a mixture of them, up to you. It can even be the alloys that don’t exist naturally, somehow. So... yeah. Go nuts.,,
Hidalgo - The Hero’s Gear,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The mask, the sword, whip, the pistol and the morse. You have them all, and all of the very finest quality. The pistol doesn’t have any of the features of the Pistol above, but ammo does refill every few hours. The horse never needs to be fed, but enjoys it, and has been trained to obey you... except when he’s feeling temperamental. Responds to Tornado.,,
Hidalgo - The Title and Name,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Don Jumper, is it? Well, now it is. You have your very own aristocratic title, along with considerable estate and wealth to go along with it, in the forms of several thousand acres of land, a trade empire of some sort, or some combination of both.%%%%This is yours without question if you’re a Hidalgo or an Administrator. It might be a church or Monastery land that you control if you’re a priest, or an inheritance you receive shortly after arriving if you’re a Drop-in.%%%%Either way, the lands are very productive and rich, and the businesses also turn enough of a profit to leave you enviably wealthy by the vast majority of people. In future jumps too, you receive the equivalent in titles and/or wealth under one of the factions in the setting, enough to make you among the most powerful men in your chosen country.,,
Hidalgo - The Hacienda,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,And this is the coup de grace of it all, of course. Your very own mansion in the spanish style, with a few additions. It is, of course, almost obscenely huge and well-appointed, with expansive gardens, dozens upon dozens of rooms, multiple ballrooms, dining halls and all the other vagaries of the far-too-rich.%%%%The cellar has one of the finest collection of wines in the world and the kitchens are staffed with an NPC crew that could have served the King of France without anyone raising a bother. In addition to all this, however, there is a network of secret rooms, passageways and tunnels throughout the mansion that would allow one to pull quite a lot of shenanigans, along with a secret barn nearby in a cave.%%%%This barn has everything you need to feed and store a horse, and plenty of space for you to put just about anything you want in. The hideout is also highly unlikely to ever be discovered, radiating a sort of ‘SEP’ effect that’s broken only once someone knows exactly what they’re looking for.,,
Priest - White Owl’s Bag,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A bag of herbs and medicines and other, similar supplies that can be cured to heal most all wounds and injuries. While there’s nothing quite magical in here, it can seem so at times, with how the mixture of the herbs serves to fix just about everything that can be wrong with the human body.%%%%That is, while there’s no cure for diseases considered incurable on 21st century Earth, like cancer and the like, the vast bulk of other diseases could be fixed by something or the other in here. And once per jump, you can heal someone who will definitely die otherwise, using the contents of this bag.%%%%Comes with the skills to use everything inside, but they stick around only so long as you have the bag.,,
Priest - The Sealed Confessional,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Necessary for any self-respecting priest. This is a very special space, though. Different from any other confessional you might know, one would wager. See, the special feature of this place is that the secrets shared in here are truly sealed, above and beyond the honor system.%%%%Anything a person tells another inside the confines of the room remains between the two of them until the person saying it gives permission to the other person. They can’t speak it, they can write it, and no telepaths can hear it when they think it. Except, that is, for one exception. You can tell anyone anything you are told.%%%%So, that should be fun, eh?,,
Priest - The Church,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Well, you might as well put the confessional here! Or not, depends on you. Anyway, this Church is a pretty decent sized, well-built church, with all the usual things churches have... and a few things extra.%%%%First of all, the Church is an automatic no-violence neutral ground. As in, violence simply isn’t possible inside the walls of the church, not of any kind. It also encourages people to calm down and make peace wherever possible. Not through outright mind control, mind you, but it does exert an effect to lower tempers and make alternative options feel better.%%%%In addition to the above, the outside of the Church is entirely indestructible, no matter what, so no cheating that way. Also, you can’t enter the place at will. Oh no. There need to be, at least, two parties at the door that are hostile to each other, be it you or another, or two people you allow, or some other combination.%%%%There can be more, but not less. And you can’t send any of them out and use it as a bunker. Actually, that last bit is the important one. If you find any way you feel will work towards using the church as an indestructible base... it just won’t work.,,
Administrator - ‘Soap’ Collection,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Or rather, Nitroglycerine. A train full of it, all for you to use however you will. This is high-end explosive, especially since it never breaks down or explode without you having intended it to.%%%%The crates full of it are in your warehouse, and they refill themselves every week or as soon as they’re empty, whichever is longer.,,
Administrator - The Position of Authority,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Well, you can’t do anything without it, can you? This is a legitimate, official position at the highest levels of government, second only to the Governor’s in the level of power it gives you. You could move vast amounts of money, or order about armies or change landscapes with simple orders.%%%%In future jumps too, you receive a position close to the top in one faction’s government, be it in the army or the civilian side, close to the top. You could be a Cabinet Minister, or a General or an Admiral second or third in command of the whole Army or Navy, that sort of thing.,,
Administrator - La Ciudadela,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,The prison for the dissidents. This is your own personal prison for whatever enemies you may wish to store inside. All but impregnable from the inside or the outside, this place has everything a prison might need. High walls, an army of NPC guards extraordinarily good at their jobs, and all the other nice goodies that a good prison is made of.%%%%In addition, there are certain extra features to this place, too. Specifically, it’s power scales directly to your own, meaning that it’s exactly as impregnable and indestructible, at all times, as it needs to be so you would be able to break into it or destroy it with your very, absolute most effort. It adapts on a real time basis, all without changing all that much visibly.%%%%In future worlds it automatically updates to be par with the top prisons of the setting, before applying the scaling effect. Which does in fact downscale to, right alongside you at all times.,,
Import / Creation,,3,,-500,,False,,False,,You know the song and dance, I trust? Create a new companion loyal to you or import an existing one. They receive 600 CP to spend on stuff and all the freebies and discounts.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Take along someone local, for 100 CP!,,
Luckless,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Not quite as bad as it probably looks, but still. You’re the victim of the chinese curse. Things just tend to go badly for you more often than not, as if someone up there had their finger on the balance. Doesn’t mean nothing good happens to you, but it does mean that a lot of bad does. Which in this day and age... well, you know.,,
Dandy,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are one. And a really bad one. A complete fop and wastrel, you enjoy nothing more than lying around drunk, except going to parties and hunting trips and all the other thing other dandies and fops enjoy.%%%%While you can do some work every now and then when you get your head out of the clouds, well, ‘every now and then’ is a lot lesser than you probably think.,,
Powerless,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Your standard power loss drawback. Nothing from outside this jump enters it with you. No powers, no items, nothing.,,
Pirates!,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Or bandits, depending on your distance from the shore. Wherever you go, you seem to attract the scum of the earth. They attack your ship, try to waylay you on long journeys and try to stab you in the cities.%%%%No matter how many you get rid of, more keep showing up.,,
The Unexpected,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The Spanish Inquisition. Yeah, those guys. Except not the real one, the pop culture version. This one doesn’t announce itself, and the trials have no connection to reality or reason. Also, the man leading it is convinced he becomes a jumper with all your powers and items if he successfully burns you at the stake.%%%%Worse part is, he’s right. Also, they got a summary of all your powers and skills, and have at least the beginnings of ways to counter them. So... run?,,
The Hated,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Ah. Your very own Rafael Moncada! Or was it Montero? Rafael, at any cost. You have your very own nemesis, a virtual mirror image of you! He has twisted copies of all your purchases from this jump, and can develop any powers or abilities you use against him.%%%%While he’s not got any immortality or ‘return’ to life abilities, nor any ability to endlessly scale to your level, he does have some pretty strong plot armor which, coupled with his aforementioned ability to develop any powers you use against him, could make things pretty interesting, eh?,,
