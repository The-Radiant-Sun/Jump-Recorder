Universal Drawbacks,,6,,105000,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Origin,,0,,00,,False,,False,,There are three different origins that you can choose from: Worker Cell, Defender Cell, and Invader. Age and Gender are irrelevant, so you can choose whatever you want for those, and, if you don’t want prior memories, you can freely choose to make any of the origins into Drop-In origins. For native cells, this will mean that you are a cell that just got injected into the body, with no memory of the prior body that you were taken from. For Invaders, you simply come into existence at the point when you are invading the body.,,
Worker Cell,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are one of your average cells, tasked with some duty to keep the body running. You could be a common red blood cell, tasked with delivering nutrients and other supplies around the body. You could be a cell that works in the stomach lining to help with breaking down food to provide those nutrients. You could even be a tiny little platelet tasked with helping patch up parts of the body when they break. Any “non-combat” cell is a potentially valid choice.,,
Defender Cell,,0,,00,,True,,False,,You are one of the cells tasked with defending the body from threats, either internal or external. You could be one of the many variations of white blood cells, or maybe a T-Cell, or an antibody-crafting B-Cell. Regardless, you are going to spend the next decade in a nigh-endless war to defend the body from all that would try to break it.,,
Invader,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You aren’t a cell of the body at all. Instead, you are some foreign invader, intent on proliferating and tearing down the body. Oh, you could certainly try to live in harmony within the body, but good luck convincing the immune responders that you aren’t a threat. You can take the shape of a single bacteria, whether foreign or symbiotic, that could be found within the human body. If you choose to be a symbiotic bacteria, you can choose to gain discounts and take Drawbacks as if you were a Worker Cell instead of an Invader, if you want.,,
Tourist,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You aren’t a cell of the body, or even truly a cell at all. Now, your body is actually the body that you are inhabiting, and you are an avatar of yourself within it. Confused? Just don’t think too hard about it. Your “city-body” self will go about everyday life like you would normally, and your true self will exist as an onlooker within the confines of the body modelled on you. You won’t be immediately marked as an invader and you don’t have any specific tasks to do, unless you take a drawback for them, so you are free to run around and explore.%%%%This is automatically a Drop-In Origin, and you do have one important limitation: The well-being of your body and your true self are linked. So if you get damaged down here, it will end up affecting the larger body, and if your larger body gets damaged, you’ll suffer that damage as well. Also, Perks that you possess will not apply to this body, so things like immunity to damage or disease will only apply to your avatar, not to the body as a whole, and such immunities won’t prevent you from experiencing damage when your body is harmed.,,
Adorbs,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are utterly adorable. You have the appearance of a child, though you do keep your physical powers, just in a far cuter package. You could get a raging monster to pause to admire how adorable you are.%%%%In future Jumps, you can toggle this to assume a cute, child-like appearance.,,
Cell Division,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,Mitosis. A very important process of splitting off new cells from old ones. And now, it is something that you can do as well.%%%%Once per month, you can split off a duplicate of yourself. This will take about eight hours to do, and while you are doing so, you can shape what they will be like. Their mind will be based on your own, though you can accentuate certain factors, and they will be unshakeably loyal to you. Their body will be based on your current form, though you can mix in features of alt-forms that you have.%%%%You can choose to divide perks or powers that you have between yourself and a duplicate, either giving them an entire perk or splitting a perk or power between the two of you. Split powers may grow back over time, though it will take quite a while.%%%%You can have up to twelve duplicates at a time, and they will recombine with you at the end of each Jump, granting you their memories and returning all powers to you. They also recombine with you if destroyed, though some memories may be lost in that case.%%%%You can recreate specific duplicates again at a later date if desired.,,
Cell Division + Cancer - Unrestricted Cell Growth,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Twelve duplicates at a time? Not any more.%%%%There is now no limit on the number of duplicates you can have at a time, no time limit on how often you can split, you can split off three duplicates at once, and it only takes about an hour to split off a duplicate.%%%%You share a mental connection with all of your duplicates as well, and if you happen to die while you have a duplicate, there is a chance that you could swap over to one of the duplicates and morph them into yourself instead. This does come with a risk of memory loss, so it is probably best to just avoid dying altogether.%%%%Additionally, it is possible for you to turn your duplicates into completely independent beings, which won’t necessarily be loyal to you, but could be taken as Companions if you have a method of doing so.,,
Cancer,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,Why be satisfied with the limits that your position in life have placed upon you? Thanks to some quirk, your chains have truly been broken, and your limits no longer exist.%%%%You can grow and grow, practically without limit, expanding in strength and power. Your body is constantly mutating and changing, and thanks to this perk, all of those changes are optimized towards making you better. Whether improvements to your muscles, mind, or some esoteric power you’ve picked up on another world, you will now never stop changing and becoming better.%%%%Level caps or their equivalents are removed, and your ‘stats’ can always improve. While in this jump, your body may feature some large growths and may end up looking distended or grossly mutated when you use this ability often.%%%%However, after this Jump, such mutations will only appear if you choose. Powers and perks that you have picked up in other Jumps can improve over time. These ‘mutations’ will generally make the powers more versatile, and only very rarely will they become more powerful. Such mutations take time, and you’ll likely only see one or two powers mutate in any given Jump.,,
Worker - Will Boost,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,There is a job to do, and you are the one to do it. No matter how boring or thankless a task may be, you can always muster up the will to get it done. This doesn’t truly eliminate boredom, but it does allow you to set it aside and not let it wear at your mind while you do the job in front of you.,,
Worker - Rules and Regs,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The body only works when everybody know their job.%%%%Now, and in future jumps, you will automatically gain a comprehensive knowledge of the rules and regulations that apply to any job or position that you happen to hold. You may still need to take a bit to remember relevant rules, but you are guaranteed to have the knowledge available to know what you should do in a given situation, at least as far as the rules are concerned.,,
Worker - Navigation,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,There are over 100,000 miles of blood vessels in the average human body, not to mention all the lengths of nerves, digestive tracts, and other organs. And when you are a tiny cell, those distances seem even longer. With so many routes to take, it is extremely easy to get lost. But not for you.%%%%You have a flawless sense of direction, and you can practically sniff out what the shortest route is to get from your location to your destination. This doesn’t guarantee that you won’t run into problems on the way, but you can be sure when the path you are taking is the shortest path to get where you want to go.,,
Worker - Tireless,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, and yours seems to be working in overdrive. You now have nigh-boundless energy and stamina to do your job, able to go for days on end running whatever tasks you have been assigned without rest. When you do reach the point where you need to take a break, you’ll find that a 10 minute break leaves you as refreshed as a week-long restful vacation.,,
Worker - Memory,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Red blood cells aren’t the only helpful worker out there. Memory cells are vital at helping cells remember what they need to know, and now, you could fulfill that function as well. Not only do you have a perfect memory, with indexing, but you also have the ability to share your memories with others at a touch, and you can take in memories the same way.%%%%,,
Worker - Memory + Jolly Cooperation - Inherited Memory,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You now can access a sort-of ‘group memory’ from whatever group or organization you happen to join. This consists of the commonly shared memories of members of the group, and extends backwards to when the group was founded. This memory isn’t quite perfect, and the older you go, the more the memories will have faded, especially when you reach memories from before any of the current members were part of the organization.,,
Worker - Jolly Cooperation,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Cells have to work together to get things done, but when they do, they are able to produce amazing results. You now provide a passive boost to the productivity and output of any group or organization that you are part of, and this boost is heightened with regards to projects or tasks that you are working on directly.%%%%The more members are working together towards a specific goal, the bigger this boost gets.,,
Worker - Activation,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Some cells need a little bit of help, bringing out their full potential. That is where the process of activation comes in. You now know how to ‘activate’ those around you, unleashing their dormant potential to grant them a tremendous boost in power. This boost requires that you present the target of this ability with either an enemy to fight or a task to perform, and the boost itself will only function with regards to that enemy or task.%%%%On a basic level, this boost consists of a tremendous boost to physical strength and power, capable of taking a nerdy weakling and turning them into a ripped shonen protagonist. It also comes with a large boost in skill related to either combat, when directed at an enemy, or the specific task the target has been given. In cases where the target possesses some other latent abilities, they too are activated by this, but again, only when directed at the specified enemy or task. This boost is temporary, and the target will eventually revert back to their prior state.%%%%They will also revert if they spend too long trying to fight a different enemy or complete a different task. Once per day, you can use this ability on yourself.,,
Worker - Activation + Cancer - Unrestrained Potential,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Who needs direction? Certainly not you, nor anyone who you are going to be using this ability on.%%%%Now, when you ‘activate’ someone, you don’t have to give them a specific task or enemy. You just pump them with power, and let them loose. You can even push extra power into them to help them push past their own limitations. Sure, this comes with some danger of them getting damaged when their bodies can’t handle the strain, and if you push too far, they could collapse from the overload, but hey. Small price to pay for power.%%%%And if they do manage to survive being pushed past their limits, they’ll find that those limits have been moved higher when they end up reverting back to their old form. Oh, and you can ‘activate’ yourself now as often as you want, though you’ll have to watch out for the same overload problems as everyone else.,,
Defender - Combat Experience,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The human body is constantly under attack by germs and viruses. So, there is no time for any of its defenders to panic while fighting to protect it.%%%%You now have combat instincts engraved into your body, allowing you to react quickly and precisely in combat and other high-stress situations. Comes with high levels of physical conditioning, and the ability to suppress those instincts if you want to appear less-threatening.,,
Defender - Natural Killer,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Those defending the body from threats are not honorable. They can’t afford to be. They have to be ruthless killing machines, and now, you could be among the best. You have an eye for weakness, being able to take just a glance and figure out the best way to kill whatever happens to be in front of you. You also don’t have to deal with pesky things like squeamishness.%%%%You can still care about life, but when something needs to die, you can set that care aside and do what needs to be done with a smile on your face.,,
Defender - Favored Enemy,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Antigens are molecules that are presented to defending cells to provoke an immune response. Now, when you are presented with an antigen (or other traces, evidences, or signs of an enemy), you can lock onto that enemy and give yourself a boost in performance while pursuing or fighting with them.%%%%You will find it easier to track down the enemy you’ve locked onto, and you’ll have a moderate boost in strength, speed, and skill when you’ve engaged them.,,
Defender - Cell Traversal,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You don’t have time to go the long way around while pursuing a virus, so you need to travel straight through a cell wall. With this, you can squeeze your way through any gap that you are able to fit at least a portion of your body through, even if it is just a finger.%%%%This power acts quicker when you are actively chasing someone or something.,,
Defender - Antibody Creation,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Preparation is the key to victory, and now, you can prepare a solution to any enemy you face. A solution in the chemical sense, anyway.%%%%You now know how to synthesize a special liquid that can be attuned to a specific enemy, acting like an acid on them when they are exposed to it. You can modulate how potent of an effect it has, from dissolving away at them, to merely giving burns, to even just targeting their clothes and equipment.%%%%This liquid does take some time to make, generally around half an hour to an hour, but it can go much quicker if you have access to some DNA or other similar chemical identifiers. With time and experimentation, you may find out how to have other effects aside from just acid, such as knocking them unconscious or sealing away their abilities for a time.,,
Defender - Antibody Creation + Lucky Defender - Premade Solutions,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You now have the ability to create special ‘blank’ solutions, which are apparently unattuned to any given enemy. However, when you carry these ‘blank’ solutions with you, and you get drawn in to face a surprise enemy, you’ll find that they are attuned specially to that enemy.%%%%You’ll have to make more ‘blank’ solutions afterward, as all prior made ‘blank’ solutions would have been attuned specifically to that surprise enemy.,,
Defender - Lucky Defender,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,It isn’t easy to defend someone you know when you are both living in an area the size of a human body. It takes time to get anywhere, so there is no guarantee that you’ll arrive in the nick of time to save the day. Except now, there is.%%%%You’ll find that when your friends or people you know are in danger, you can get urges that will help you to arrive just in the nick of time, sometimes even allowing you to seem to teleport with how quickly you’ll be able to traverse distances to get there in time. In addition, you can more generally find yourself winding up in positions to help defend random people.%%%%This doesn’t make it so more people need defending than before, it just helps bend probability a bit to ensure that you are in the right place to help.,,
Defender - Consumption,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,One of a white blood cells most iconic behaviors is the ability to eat invaders whole, both as a method of stopping them, and as a method of gaining information about them to help recognize future threats.%%%%Now, you can consume pieces of an enemy (or just some random being, animal, or thing) to gain information and knowledge about it. This includes both information specific to them, and more general information about their group, race, civilization, etc. If left alone, the information gained is somewhat random, but it can be focused on specific insights that you want to gain.%%%%Any body pieces will do, though flesh and blood works best. For those who are a bit squeamish, more metaphorical methods can work, such as eating a photo of them or a voodoo doll designed to look like them, though these methods result in much, much less information (your body will process non-food items consumed for this purpose just fine, treating it as “generic food”).%%%%In addition, if you don’t want to actually eat whatever it is, you can substitute holding it in your hand and absorbing it into your body through your palm instead. This still transfers the absorbed mass to your stomach, so you can get full from doing this, and it takes as long as if you were eating it bite-by-bite normally.,,
Defender - Conspumption + Cancer - Unrelenting Hunter,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Why stop at information? You can now gain not just information and knowledge, but also abilities and skills from those that you consume.%%%%Your body will have to evolve and adapt to use those abilities and skills, and particularly strong-willed individuals may leave traces of their personality and thoughts behind to bother you, but it still a great way to gain a bunch of strength. You do have to consume the entire individual to gain their skills this way, but like before, you can absorb them via your hand if you don’t feel like getting your teeth dirty.%%%%As a side benefit, you can metabolize absolutely anything now, whether you are eating it for use with this ability or not, and the limits on the amount you can eat have been broken. No worries about getting fat.%%%%You can also absorb things via your palm much quicker, taking only about 10 seconds to absorb a whole body.,,
Invader - Enviro-Protect,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You don’t have the luxury of being brought up nice and safe in a warm body. No, you’ve had to endure the wildly hostile environments that exist outside of a human’s skin, and you’ve evolved protections to help defend you. You can now endure extremes in temperature, pressure, air quality, and other such environmental concerns without issue.%%%%This protection focuses specifically on environmental factors, not deliberate attacks, so naturally extreme heat won’t bother you, but someone trying to set you on fire will still cause you to burn like normal.,,
Invader - Hovering,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,If a bacteria or virus wants to really be successful, it needs to be airborne. You can now throw yourself into the air, loosening yourself from the bonds of gravity to float through the air.%%%%While you can move yourself about, it is more of a gentle glide than anything else. If you want to move faster, you’ll have to find your own methods of propulsion.,,
Invader - Stealth,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,What good is it to make it into a nice body, when the alarm just gets raised right away? No good at all, which is why you’ve become a master of stealth. You excel at remaining unseen and finding out-of-the-way locations to hide in. As a bonus, you won’t trip automated alarms or sensors, so if someone is going to raise the alarm, they’ll have to do it manually.%%%%Once the alarm is raised, however, this protection disappears, so don’t think they can’t track you down once they know you’re here. Best to just stay hidden.,,
Invader - Natural Weapons,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You never know when you’ll have to fight against some uppity white blood cell, so you need to have weapons close at hand. Or maybe, close in hand. Whether it is a set of claws, a stinger, poison gas sacs, or something else, you’ve got some kind of natural weapon that you can use to defend yourself. You can retract or conceal these natural weapons easily, rendering them effectively undetectable until you bring them out again. At the start of a new Jump, you’ll have the option to alter what form these natural weapons take to fit your new body, but they do have to be natural. No adamantium claws or laser cannon eyeballs.,,
Invader - Minion Maker,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,If you actually go out yourself and cause a mess, you are liable to end up getting dog-piled by a bunch of goody-goody defender cells. That’s why you need to infect some cells to make into your minions and have them go do your dirty work instead.%%%%Now, if you spend about four hours concentrating and interacting with someone, you can brainwash them into becoming your minion. It is possible to break this time up over several ‘sessions’, but doing so will increase the time required as the power wears off a bit in-between. Also, it may take longer to wear down those with above average willpower.%%%%Minions you make will retain their old personality, except for the fact that they will be loyal to you and want to follow your orders. Giving them an order that conflicts with their old personality can cause some internal conflict that might break them free eventually, and if you don’t interact with them at least once a week or so, the conditioning will start to degrade.%%%%However, aside from that, they will faithfully carry out your orders as best they can. Minions do not count as Companions unless you pay to somehow take them with you.,,
Invader - Minion Maker + Immuno-Confusion - Mayham Sowing,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Even if you can’t make someone into a full minion, doesn’t mean that they can’t work for you. Now, just by interacting with someone for five minutes or so, you can implant a thought or urge into their head that they will want to act on in some way.%%%%You can’t control how they will act on it, and they can simply choose not to, but either way, they won’t realize they are being influenced by you.%%%%This power is more effective when used to try and incite actions that will cause chaos.,,
Invader - Immuno-Confusion,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,What is better than tearing through your enemies and watching them fall before you? Watching them tear each other apart as you turn them against each other, of course. The human immune system is typically a well-oiled machine at fighting against invaders, but if you throw a few wrenches in the gears, it can end up being its own worst enemy.%%%%You now excel at sabotaging attempts to stand against you, turning defenses aimed at you against themselves, and just generally ensuring that attempts to defeat you do more damage to those opposing you than they do to you.%%%%Whether it is dodging at just the right moment to have someone stab their ally, or arranging things so some automated defenses kill the defenders, rather than yourself, you’ll find it basically instinctive to act to make your enemies sabotage themselves.,,
Invader - Adaption,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,There is an eternal arms race between the bacterial and viral forces seeking to infiltrate the human body, and those pesky defenders trying to keep them out. And now, you are at the bleeding-edge of that race. Any time that you are exposed to a danger or damaging influence, your body will immediately start adapting to be able to counter that threat, eventually rendering you immune to damage of that type.%%%%This effect also extends to your mind and soul and any other vector for attacking yourself, though it works fastest on physical threats.%%%%These adaptations aren’t eternal, and if you never face damage from a given source for several years, the immunity may begin to fade as your body adapts to face more current threats, but regular dangers will soon prove to be no danger at all to you.,,
Invader - Adaption + Cancer - Unreal Evolution,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Why wait until you are attacked to adapt? Now, so long as you are aware of a threat, your body, mind, and soul will start adapting to neutralize it, and do so much, much faster than it otherwise would. It can even adapt ways to reflect the threat back towards the source or gain benefit from it rather than damage.%%%%It is true that you’ll have to keep an eye out, so that you don’t accidentally ‘counter’ a pat on the back with a reflexive spiky shell or something, but the safety that is provided from being able to adapt to threats before they actually attack is more than worth it.,,
Tourist - I Belong,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You might be new to this neighborhood, but you’ll find you can fit in soon enough.%%%%Whenever you move somewhere new (or when you start a new Jump), you’ll find that you can easily and quickly pick up on the local customs and mannerisms, to the point where people will probably assume that you are a local before too long.%%%%As long as you don’t do anything to specifically draw attention to the fact that you are new or not from around here, you’ll be easily accepted as belonging wherever you happen to be.,,
Tourist - Explanitory Lables,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,When you are looking at thing from a cell’s eye view, things may seem unfamiliar, even if you were trained in biology and medicine.%%%%Now, when you are examining something, you can get a small pop-up describing the type of object you are looking at, or the race / species of the person you are examining, as well as a few common facts about that object type or race / species. Covers about the amount of information that you might expect from a brief encyclopedia entry.,,
Tourist - Status Report,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,It is important to know how your body is functioning, especially when you are living within it. You can now mentally access a set of ‘status reports’ on the physical status of your body.%%%%They are written from the point of view of your cells, and will report on how well your body is running at the current point in time. Very useful when you want to diagnose why you are feeling sore or what exactly this strange lump on your arm is.,,
Tourist - Friend Finder,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The body is a massive place, especially when you are the size of a single cell. The chances of you managing to meet up with the same cell are astronomically small. Now, however, the odds will lean in your favor.%%%%Circumstances bend to allow you to find people you know much, much easier, with you often finding friendly faces ‘just happening’ to have been walking by in the same area where you are.%%%%Can be toggled on and off at will.,,
Tourist - This City is Me,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are living in a massive city-scape that represents your personal body, and now, that connection goes even deeper than it would before.%%%%You now have a sense of proprioception with relation to the large cityscape, allowing you to detect generally what is happening, as well as helping with navigation in the wider city. Even better, you can use this connection to apply some of the perks and powers that apply specifically to your body to the cityscape around you. For example, a regeneration power could lead to the infrastructure of the city healing itself, and a shapeshifting power could allow you to manipulate the layout of the city somewhat. These powers will be diffused and weaker than they are when operating solely upon your body, but they will still be significant enough to have a noticeable effect.%%%%In future Jumps, you can take a day to synchronize this power with a new city, though the power will break if you move beyond the city limits.,,
Tourist - This City is Me + Anthropomorphic Incarnation,,1,,00,,True,,True,,When you bond with the city, you’ll find that you’ve awakened certain spirits within it, tied to the various locations and infrastructures within the city itself.%%%%These spirits are invisible to the general populace, though they can reveal themselves if they so choose, and they are able to interact with and manipulate the location or infrastructure that they represent.%%%%Within this jump, they may be the spirits of different organs, such as the heart or lungs. In future Jumps, they can be spirits connected with parks, museums, or public buses, as examples.,,
Tourist - Anthropromorphic Incarnation,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Having cells acting and interacting like humans can help with understanding them and learning more about them, and this sort of understanding can apply to other things as well.%%%%You can now reach out and focus on some inanimate or non sentient object or living organism, and transform it into an anthropomorphic version of itself. They will gain a human form and basic human levels of intelligence, but will have thoughts, emotions, and priorities that revolve around their normal form and function. An anthropomorphized car may want to transport people and things around, while an anthropomorphized tree may simply want to sunbathe. You can choose instead to have the anthropomorphic form appear next to their normal self, in which case they must remain in very close proximity to their normal self.%%%%This power can allow you to communicate with and come to understand the target of the power better, and it is possible for changes in their behavior to be implemented if you are convincing enough.%%%%You can only target one thing at a time with this to start with, causing prior targets to revert to normal when you target something new, though you may be able to expand that number slowly over time.%%%%These anthropomorphic incarnations are not ordinarily capable of being taken as Companions, unless you would be capable of taking them as a Companion in their normal state without this perk.,,
Tourist - Your Cells at Work,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are a body made up of cells, within a body made up of cells. You now have the option to have your body function like the city-body within this jump, having your cells be anthropomorphized and all possessing roughly human level intelligence. This means that your cells will work together, and that they are both capable of having a far greater impact while performing their various duties, and are capable of much greater levels of co-operation and creativity when working together to accomplish what they need to accomplish.%%%%You are also capable of forming an internal Avatar to communicate with your various cells, which will be recognized as being an ultimate authority within your body.%%%%If you have the Tourist Origin, you will be recognized as having this authority among the normal cells within this Jump. This authority, and the ability to communicate with and coordinate your cells, can allow you to have your body operate in non-standard ways, so long as you can convince your cells to do things they wouldn’t normally do. They will push back if your actions would be deathly harmful to your body.%%%%You can split your focus evenly between your normal body and this Avatar without any degradation in mental function on either end.,,
Tourist - Your Cells at Work + Cancer - Unrealistic Biologies,,1,,00,,True,,True,,It is not only your body that has humanoid cells now, is it? Now, you can either choose to have a general global effect that leads to all other living beings having humanoid cells, or an effect caused by deliberate interaction from you. In either case, those affected by this will act normally, for the most part, and the differences will not be openly discernable from a macro-level perspective.%%%%Their cells, however, will experience the alteration in capacity that your own cells have gained, though to a much lesser extent. When you are in fairly close proximity to someone who is affected by this power, you can form an Avatar of yourself within their body, and interact with their cells. You won’t have the same absolute authority as you would within your own body, but you can work to either help improve their cells, or undermine their body’s performance.%%%%Other beings capable of shrinking to a cellular level can also enter bodies and interact with these humanoid cells.,,
Nutrients,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,A simple box with a label of ‘Nutrients’ on the outside. Within, you will find 60 cans, each labeled with the word ‘Nutrient’. Each can contains a brownish slop with a vaguely meaty taste that, when consumed, provides all the nutrition that a human body (or closely equivalent race) needs for 1 day.%%%%Those that need more or less nutrients than a human in a day will have to consume an equivalent ratio of cans to gain the same effect. Refills each week. Anthropomorphized cells count as humans for the purpose of these cans.,,
Cell Maker Machine,,2,,-5000,,False,,True,,A tall glass cylinder filled with a mysterious greenish liquid, with a scientific control console attached to the base. There are attachments in the console that allow for the machine to be hooked up to a living being. When hooked up, the will begin to grow a clone of whatever is hooked up to it within the liquid.%%%%Growing a human (or anthropomorphized cell while in this Jump) takes approximately 1 week. Those with greater or lesser mass will take a proportionally shorter or longer amount of time. Increased and decreased biological complexity will also alter the rate of time to completion.%%%%The final clone will end up greatly resembling the donor in personality, knowledge, and mannerisms, though it will understand that it is a clone.%%%%If the process was interrupted and restarted, it is possible for editing errors to creep in.%%%%Only wholly biological abilities are manifest in the clone.,,
Worker - Uniform,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,A clean, professional looking uniform, which can change color and style to fit whatever your job happens to be. Durable, stain-proof, breathable, and very comfortable, it also has a neat trick of being able to change color to match your mood if desired, becoming brighter when you are happy and energetic, and darker when you are tired or sad.%%%%It also can help provide a boost of energy to you from time to time to get the job done.,,
Worker - Delivery Boxes,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A stack of a dozen collapsed cardboard boxes and a set of mailing labels. When the boxes are put together, they are capable of holding roughly three times the volume their exterior dimensions would suggest.%%%%If one of the mailing labels is placed on the box, a red-uniformed delivery person will show up shortly thereafter to take the box for delivery.%%%%Delivery will be same day within a city range, same week within a country, and same month on a planetary range, and is completely untraceable and not interceptable up to the point where delivery is made.%%%%These boxes and mailing labels replenish once per month.,,
Worker - Handy Map,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,A map of the human body, this not only showcases the various veins and other routes a cell can take, but also updates in real time to reflect damage and injuries, blockages due to clots, and other obstacles.%%%%In each new jump, you can choose to either synchronize the map to a city or to a living being.%%%%When synched to a city, it will provide a real-time updated map of the city’s streets and other transportation routes. When synched to a living being, it will show real-time updates about their health and general status.%%%%The map can be synchronized to a new city or living being once per year in future jumps.,,
Worker - Memory Library,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A massive set of bookshelves, containing countless memories stored in book form. Each book represents the memories of a single individual, stored in the form of a diary written from their perspective.%%%%When someone reads these diaries, they will be able to immerse themselves in the memory, essentially reliving it as if they were there.%%%%To start with, this library contains the memories of several thousand cells, going back a few generations. Blank books are provided on one of the shelves, and allow for new sets of memories to be added. To do so, the donor will have to sit down and start writing down their memories. This process will happen supernaturally fast, with a year’s worth of memories being transcribed in just around ten minutes. The process also sharpens the memory of the donor, refreshing old memories to allow them to be transcribed accurately.%%%%The donor can choose to leave out certain memories or to lower the level of detail provided, but they can’t falsify their memory of what occurred, even by psychic or supernatural means. They also won’t have to worry about their hand cramping from writing down the memories.,,
Defender - Weapon,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A simple melee weapon. Traditionally a knife, but any sort of melee weapon can be substituted. This weapon will never break, rust, or become dull, and if separated from you, it will appear back in its sheath or holder unless you deliberately handed it off. Even then, you can call it back to its holder with a thought.%%%%Wounds that this weapon causes bleed far more than they should and have a greater effect on the target than they normally would.,,Glaive
Defender - Detector,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A simple radar-like device that can detect the presence of germs and foreign invaders. By default, it emits a pinging sound when they are close, getting louder and more frequent as they draw closer. It can be modified to send alerts in other ways, and has been upgraded slightly to provide indications of direction and distance on an attached screen.%%%%In future jumps, it can be modified to detect other threats, such as specific species, the presences of weapons, etc., though it can only detect a single type of threat at a time, and its range and accuracy of detection increases the more specific the thing is it is designed to detect.,,
Defender - Antibody Shooter,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,A large two-handed gun, capable of spraying large blasts of liquid antibodies. Comes with an auto-synthesizer and bio-scanner, allowing it to lock onto a specific target and scan it for weaknesses, and then synthesize an antibody specifically designed to attack those weaknesses.%%%%It takes some time to scan and synthesize, on the order of several minutes minimum, but this time can be decreased if data is prepared and fed into the bio-scanner ahead of time about the biology of the target.,,
Defender - Sneeze Button,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A small handheld remote with two buttons on it, red and green.%%%%When the remote is pointed at an individual or object and the green button is pressed, a ‘mucus bubble’ will rise up around the targeted individual or object. This bubble is very sticky and durable, but can be broken out of given enough time or force. When the green button is pressed while aimed at someone or something trapped in a mucus bubble, a ‘sneeze rocket’ forms around the bubble, before launching straight up into the air and exploding with the sound of a massive sneeze, causing the trapped person or object to be hurtled off into the distance.%%%%When the remote is pointed at a location and the red button is pressed, a sneeze rocket descends down from the sky and crashes on the target location, exploding with the sound of a massive sneeze and causing a large wave of overpressure to blast outward. Both buttons will go dim after being pressed, and can’t be pressed again until they light up again.%%%%The green button takes roughly 1 minute to relight, while the red button takes roughly 12 hours.,,
Invader - Cell Mask,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A simple ceramic mask depicting a fairly average looking face. Those viewing someone wearing this mask will see the wearer as being an ordinary cell, no matter what their actual body shape may be.%%%%Physical interaction can break this effect, though accidental bumping may be ignored. Similarly, if the mask is removed or broken, the effect will break. If someone sees the wearer putting on the mask, they will be immune to the effect of the mask for the next day.%%%%At the start of each new jump, you can select a different common race in that jump, and the mask will now make the wearer appear to be a member of that race instead. Note that the mask will not let you mimic a specific individual, it only gives you a generic appearance of your chosen race.,,
Invader - Capsule Net,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A net of tightly woven fibers, that can be used for both defense and capture.%%%%The net can be controlled mentally while held, allowing the wielder to stiffen it to the consistency of high-grade steel to block physical attacks.%%%%The net can emit a bit of acid in this state, burning at people or objects that touch it, aside from the wielder.%%%%The net can also be expanded and have sections broken off and thrown to engulf targets, causing a minor smokescreen at the same time.,,
Invader - Allergens,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,A sack full of strange white lumps. These lumps are concentrated allergens, capable of disrupting the normal flow of the body by causing a tremendous overreaction within the immune system.%%%%When an allergen is tightly squeezed, it will burst out into a mist that will spread out into the local area, causing an increase in both violent behaviors and accidental collateral damage. This effect is especially potent on those who would normally be defending the area.%%%%This mist will fill the local organ within the body, and in future jumps, will cover several city blocks worth of area, and will last for several hours.%%%%The bag contains around 20 of these lumps, and refills at the beginning of each month.,,
Invader - Virus Hat,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,A red hat with white patterns and designs on its surface. When placed upon someone’s head, they will rapidly turn into a zombie-like figure, desiring only to cause havoc, attack others, and spread more of the virus. The virus spreads by budding off small lumps from the hat, which then rapidly expand into more floating hats, which will seek out an attach to people, continuing the cycle.%%%%Particularly strong, willful, or healthy individuals can resist the infection for longer, and if the hat is removed soon enough, victims can be saved.%%%%If all the zombies and hats are destroyed or otherwise neutralized, a new hat will appear in your possession within 1 month.%%%%You can program specific behaviors into the hat before releasing it, such as causing the hat to target only specific types of people, leaving specific people alone, or engage in certain simple behaviors such as congregating in large packs or specifically destroying technological items.%%%%You can also set a time limit, causing all the hats to self-destruct after a certain time has passed, and once it has been deployed, you can initiate such a self-destruct just by placing your hand on one of the hats.%%%%Finally, you can customize the appearance of the hat, changing its color, shape, and form, though it still has to be something that attached to the victim’s head in some way.%%%%You are always immune to infection by these hats.,,
Backup,,3,,00,,False,,False,,Cells need to work together, and now you can call in your friends to help you. For 50 CP, you can import a single companion, and for 300 CP, you can import a full set of 8. Each of these companions will have 600 CP to spend and a free Origin. Companions cannot take the Tourist Origin.,,
Steroid Bot,,3,,-500,,False,,True,,A strange robotic figure. It is programmed to end violent conflicts by unleashing overwhelming violence against them until they cease. Useful as a potential weapon, but it is possible that you could find a way to reprogram it to be a little less indiscriminate.,,
Platelet Crew,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,A full crew of frankly adorable platelets. They take up a single companion space, and are perpetual children. These two dozen or so platelets are cheerful and eager to work, and they can accomplish some amazingly big tasks when working together. They have the effects of Adorbs and Jolly Cooperation.,,
Other Cells,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,If there is another cell or bacteria that you have befriended during your time here, you can take them along as a companion for 100 CP. They will have the effects of both of the 100 CP perks for the Origin that best fits them. As a note, you can befriend and take Parasites or helpful Bacteria, and they will get the 100 CP perks from the Invader origin.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,You can take a total of 800 CP worth of drawbacks,,
A Familiar Body,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Rather than being within the body of a generic human, you can be in an entirely different body. You could choose to be in the body of one of your Companions (in which case they would spend the decade living a life on an ordinary Earth), or in the body of a generic member of some other race that you have come across in your travels. Experience what it is like to be a cell in a Vulcan or Kryptonian body.%%%%In such a case, all cells are still anthropomorphized to appear to be human, and they don’t gain any particular special abilities aside from those listed in this document. If you have taken the Tourist Origin, then this option is restricted to your personal alt-forms, and you cannot select to have a Companion take the place of the body.,,
Half Dose Clumsy,,4,,1000,,True,,False,,You have a tendency to fumble with things and may occasionally drop them, but you aren’t especially clumsy otherwise.,,Retail Rocker
Clumsy,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are somewhat accident-prone, often tripping over your own feet or knocking over a stack of boxes as you move by. Can be somewhat dangerous when you are running away, and may end up causing your fellow cells / bacteria getting annoyed at you. Can be taken at normal and half dose by Companions.%%%%,,
Double Dose Clumsy,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You are so clumsy that it would be hilarious if it wasn’t happening to you. It seems like every action you take leads to a chain reaction of errors and issues, like you are constantly setting off Rube Goldberg machines of disaster.,,
Half Dose Lost,,4,,500,,False,,False,,You aren’t necessarily getting lost, but you do usually end up taking longer and less-efficient paths to get anywhere. This can be handy when you want to sightsee, but problematic when you do need to get somewhere in a hurry.,,
Lost,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You were headed for the throat, but somehow ended up in the lungs. And when you try to back-track, you instead ended up in the spinal cord. Every so often, you will find your attention wandering as you travel from place to place, resulting in you getting mixed up and turned around.%%%%You can generally find your way in the end, especially if you can get someone to help guide you, but you’ll be repeatedly late and side-tracked while you are here. Can be taken at normal and half dose by Companions.,,
Double Dose Lost,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You might as well give up on going anywhere deliberately. Unless someone grabs your hand and physically drags you somewhere, you are only likely to end up someplace by accident. And even in that case, there are good odds that they will end up getting turned around as well.,,
Half Dose Rigid,,4,,500,,False,,False,,Your first instinct is always to follow the rules or your Invader instincts, but if you focus, you can decide to do something else instead. Still, in the heat of the moment, when you don’t have time to think, you’ll find yourself falling back on the rules more than anything else.,,
Rigid,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Cells have structure and rules that they have to follow, and you are more rigid than most. You are extremely strict and by-the-book. You will always feel a need to follow the rules, and don’t handle surprises or unexpected situations all that well.%%%%In the case of Invaders, this takes the form of following your instincts, even when it might be smarter to try something else. You can stop yourself from following an obviously self-destructive rule, but even then, you’ll feel a strong pull to do what you are “supposed” to do. Can be taken at normal and half dose by Companions.,,
Double Dose Rigid,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You might as well be a robot, because when there is a conflict between what you want to do and the rules / instincts that are set for your kind of cell, the rules / instincts are going to win. You can do your own thing when there aren’t specific rules to follow, but when the time comes that you are called on or need to act like the cell you are, you’ll do so in the way that cell would act.,,
Half Dose Rage,,4,,500,,False,,False,,Your rage is confined to one specific trigger. This can be anything from hearing people laughing or seeing a germ hurt someone. The rest of the time, you can be perfectly kind and pleasant, but when you see your triggering event, you’ll immediately fly into a full rage.,,
Rage,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Cell Smash! Something about the world you find yourself in just makes you so angry! Maybe it is how you are expected to do the same job, day in and day out. Maybe it is the fact that all these germs just keep coming in and attacking the body. Maybe it is all these goodie-goodie cells running around, stopping you from taking whatever it is that you want. Whatever the case may be, you have a hair-trigger temper, and you’ll find yourself lashing out without thinking at whoever happens to be around when something sets you off, and you’ll find that you keep getting enraged by things, even when they aren’t directly related to the source of your rage. Can be taken at normal and half dose by Companions.,,
Double Dose Rage,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Just go ahead and change your name to Berserker. You are practically mad with rage, charging forward screaming and lashing out at those around you. This could be useful if you are a defender that can be kept pointed at the enemy. It is much less useful for a hair follicle that is just supposed to make sure a hair grows properly.,,
Half Dose Fluid Soaked,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,The fluid that you end up getting soaked in is water, and so it is less disgusting, but it can still be annoying to be getting soaked so often.,,
Fluid Soaked,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It is almost like you are a water (or general bodily fluid) magnet. From blood to pus to urine, you’ll find yourself fairly often ending up getting soaked in some sort of fairly disgusting fluids. This can be fluids from the body itself, or fluids from your fellow cells (as you can all apparently bleed). Regardless of the source, you are guaranteed to find it at least a little bit nauseating. Can be taken at normal and half dose by Companions.,,
Double Dose Fluid Soaked,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Frankly, you’ll be spending more time soaked than not now, and no matter how often it occurs, you’ll never be able to fully suppress the nausea and disgust it causes. What is more, some of the fluids may end up actually being somewhat dangerous, like stomach acid, so you’ll have to react quickly to either avoid the spray or clean it off quickly.,,
The Smell,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Bodies smell gross, and you are having to live inside of one. Now, the body will be constantly giving off all kinds of odors, most of them noxious, and you will have to live with it. Gives no points if you lack or remove your sense of smell. Gives 100 CP to companions who have a sense of smell.,,
Half Dose Greedy Glutton,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,While you are certainly hungrier than normal, it isn’t enough to drive you completely mad. You’ll just find yourself needing to eat more often than you otherwise would, and so you’ll need to find a way to account for the extra food you’ll go through.,,
Greedy Glutton,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You need more! You aren’t satisfied with just the normal amount of nutrients that a cell normally needs. No, you are far, far hungrier, and you’ll feel compelled to do whatever it takes to get those extra nutrients, up to and including killing other cells to steal their own nutrients. Hopefully, you won’t get driven that far, but you are at the very least going to be a nutrient-based kleptomaniac. Can be taken at normal or half dose by Companions.,,
Double Dose Greedy Glutton,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,No matter how much you eat, you will always feel a gaping hunger inside, demanding to be filled. If you ignore it, you will waste away, so you have to eat, but it will never end up satisfying you, and you’ll continue being driven to greater and greater extremes to try and satisfy the gnawing hunger in your belly.,,
Scrapes, Bruises, and Bumps,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Worker, Defender or Tourist only%%%%The body that you are in seems to be far more accident-prone than most. The infrastructure of the body is constantly getting damaged, and you seem to always be at ground zero when it does. So, you’ll need to get good at dodging away from massive pits forming, veins rupturing, and other catastrophic damage that could result in you getting killed or flung out of the body. Grants 150 CP to companions with the Worker Cell or Defender Cell Origin.,,
Inverted,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Invader Only%%%%All of the bodies around you seem to be unnaturally resistant to injury, making it much much more difficult to actually invade their bodies. Even typical weak points, like the mouth, are much harder to get into than normal. Grants 100 CP to companions with the Invader Origin.,,
Half Dose No Downtime,,4,,1500,,False,,False,,You have a set of tasks to complete, but the deadlines are much more flexible, giving you time to rest for at least a bit. You still won’t have time to have a ‘life’ outside of completing the tasks, but you at least have a little bit of room to sit and breathe.,,
No Downtime,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Cells don’t have time to take breaks or go out and see the sights, and now, neither do you.%%%%You will be given a set of tasks to complete. If you are late on any of them, it counts as a failure for this jump, and the timing on them won’t give you much, if any, time for things like sleep.%%%%When you complete a set of tasks, you’ll immediately be given a new set, and you’ll have to keep up that pace throughout your entire time here.%%%%Even if you are an Invader, you will somehow still be given a list of tasks to complete, relevant to you.,,
Paranoia,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,There are germs everywhere! Everywhere you go, you are seeing enemies and monsters. Unfortunately for you, this is pretty much just all in your head. Many of those you see as enemies are actually your fellow cells. If you are a Worker Cell, they’ll be looking at you oddly for running away from them. If you are a Defender Cell, they’ll be screaming at you to stop attacking them.%%%%What’s worse, you also keep mistaking enemies for friends, wandering up to actual hostile bacteria as if they were your fellow cells. For Invaders, you have much more of the latter than the former; you can never seem to recognize which cells are Defenders out to attack you until they already are, and you may end up mistaking harmless cells for a mass of Defenders trying to take you down. You might even mistake some of the Defenders as being your fellow bacteria, here to back you up.,,
Half Dose Paranoia,,4,,1500,,False,,False,,You may mistake friendly or neutral cells for enemies, but at the very least, you aren’t going to be mistaking enemies for friends.%%%%If you recognize someone as an ally, you can be sure that they are who you recognize them as.,,
Half Dose Autoimmune Response,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You will still set alarm bells ringing in the immune system, but it is now more of an inconsistent glitch than a constant problem, and defender cells will be a little more willing to talk things out rather than just attacking. Only a little, though, you’ll still probably have to avoid an attack or three before you can get them to listen. Unless you are an Invader, in which case they’ll still attack like normal.%%%%You only have to spend a fifth of the jump inside a body if you have this Drawback as an Invader.,,
Autoimmune Response,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Something about you just sets alarms ringing. Literally. You will register as an invader to the defenses of whatever body you are in.%%%%For Workers and Defenders, this means that you are liable to get attacked by the various defenses, and you’ll have to either avoid them or try and talk your way out. Be careful, because most Defenders are the type to attack first and ask questions never.%%%%For Invaders, this means that the defenses of the body will be even more sensitive to your presence, and they will be supernaturally good at arriving at your location very shortly after arrival. If you are an Invader, you’ll need to spend at least half the jump inside a body if you have this Drawback.%%%%Can be taken at normal or half dose by Companions.,,
Double Dose Autoimmune Response,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Welp. It looks like every single cell, bacteria, and virus considers you to be an enemy.%%%%Every cellular organism, except for your Companions, will attack you on sight, from white blood cells to bacteria to cute little platelets. If they see you, they will attack.%%%%Invaders who take this don’t have any special requirement to spend time in a body, because they will still be being attacked, even outside of the body. Only take this if you enjoy fighting for your life against unending hordes for a decade. As a final note, they don’t lose their own intelligence when fighting against you, so it is possible for those attacking you to adapt and learn over time.,,
Blood Doesn't Bleed,,4,,5000,,False,,False,,Worker, Defender, or Invader only%%%%You are now a cell. Not an anthropomorphized cell, but an actual cell of whatever type you happened to choose.%%%%The world is now ‘realistic’, save for the fact that you can still think like normal. You’ll be limited to the capabilities of your realistic cell body, though you could find a way to use other powers that are not tied to having a particular form.%%%%Companions can get 200 CP if you take this Drawback.,,
Black Body,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Worker or Defender only%%%%Normally, you are put into a body that is in relative good health. Not perfect, but not bad either, the quintessential average human being. That is no longer the case here.%%%%You are now in a body that is on its last legs. Disease-ridden, addicted to a variety of bad-for-you substances, hosting a plethora of health issues, this body isn’t likely to live out the entire decade. So, you are going to have to work hard to ensure that the body doesn’t completely collapse on you, which is a tall order to ask from a single cell.%%%%Worker or Defender Companions will get a full 300 CP if you take this Drawback.,,
