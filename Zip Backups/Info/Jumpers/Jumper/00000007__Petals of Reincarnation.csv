Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You may freely choose one of the below four locations.%%%%Suburban Tokyo%%The ordinary streets of Tokyo’s outer suburbs. You wake up on one of the many concrete walled waterways. It may seem like a peaceful suburbia but only just a little ways away is the hunting ground of a notable Sinner, where the story of one young boy named Touya is about to kick off.%%%%Cave Entrance%%A little ways out of Tokyo is a large forest, within which is the entrance to a huge underground cavern. This is the secret hideout of the Forest of the Greats, which you happen to be standing just outside of. If you’re a Great, you could probably parlay your way into recruitment here but otherwise, making yourself scarce would be a wise choice.%%%%Castle%%Hidden in an unknown location somewhere within Japan is a large fortress, the main base of Kouu and his army of darkness. 300 Sinners live here, though many of them are roaming through the various cities of the world at the moment. Sinners are welcome here and Greats with the right loyalties or lack thereof could find eager employers here too. You begin just outside the gates that enter to the property.%%%%Hidden Base%%If you’re not already part of the secret organisation of Modern Greats, you’ll probably not want to end up here. The home base of the international task force that opposes all rogue Reincarnators, it’s hidden in a top secret location within Japan and filled with the best technology the world’s superpowers can provide, combined with the expertise of their very good technicians. If you’re a member, it’s a welcoming home. If not...those prison cells are awfully good at keeping even powered people inside.%%%%%%Your age is 12+2d10. Your gender is whatever it was before. Both of these may be changed to any possible result for 100 CP.,,
Woodsman,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Forest of the Greats is a Japan based, though with global connections, group of Great Reincarnators. Brought together by a now deceased man named Seiya, this group of around 20 people has an amazing amount of power and is currently led by John Von Neumann...or at least it seems to be so on the surface. You’ve been part of the group for a few years now, ever since it was founded in fact. You were there for the betrayal of one of the other founding members, a mighty Reincarnator named Kouu, and for the slow gathering in power to what it is today. The Forest works towards World Peace but you have noticed over time that there seem to be suspicious things happening, like the overwhelming focus on killing Sinners as a way to better the world.,,
Sinful Soldier,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Kouu was a former member of the Forest of the Greats. Some say the most powerful Reincarnator on Earth, at least now that Seiya has died. After he split from his original group due to their focus on killing Sinners, despite Kouu himself being a Sinner, he made his own faction. 300 Sinners united under a single banner, a place where they could indulge themselves against the foes he sent them against, secure in the knowledge that they would never kill an innocent again under his guidance. Kouu plans to eventually face his old companions once more, though what his exact intentions are have been unclear to this point. You were recruited into this army, either as a Sinner or as a Great, and have received a significantly high up commanding position. Whether or not you believe in Kouu or your comrades is a separate matter.,,
Independent,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Not every Reincarnator serves a faction. Many, especially Sinners, go it alone and pursue a normal life or their own personal desires. Some even join the group that is dedicated to opposing villainous Reincarnators, largely made out of Modern Greats. Some don’t even have a history in this world at all, despite how impossible it may seem. You may choose from any of the above options if you take this origin. You can be an independent Reincarnator that has a history in this world or one that is dropped in with no connections here or even a Reincarnator that is hired by the task force against other Reincarnators.,,
Woodsman - Honed to the Razor Edge,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Something about the look in your eyes can freeze people in their tracks. There’s an intensity to your gaze and your manner, one that both unnerves people and allures them. When you become focused on obtaining something, from victory in battle to seducing a lovely lady partner, your attempts to intimidate or attract those around you become far more successful. There’s an instinctive fear or desire for the sheer intensity that you give off during those moments, something that may even become addictive to a small degree.,,
Woodsman - Grim Will,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You may not normally think a person who cuts their own throat to have a strong will but when it is done on faith from an untrustworthy source and just for a chance at power? The situation looks a little different. You’ve got a will that is not just nearly unbreakable towards others, it allows you to decisively do any sort of disgusting or self-harming thing if necessary. You can slice open your own throat without hesitation if you believed it necessary or wade through all kinds of shit and filth in pursuit of your goals. You are even able to force yourself past any fears or phobias that you may still have, crushing your terror with sheer will.,,
Woodsman - The Devil in Sheep’s Skin,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You might be on their team...but whoever said you were on their side? Making people do what you want them to do and accepting it or even thinking it was their idea in the first place has always been your forte. While you’re a terribly charismatic fellow normally, it’s in dealing with those you are working with and allied with where you bring out your real talents. You’re capable of effortlessly manipulating those on your side, even to doing things they would find horrific if you have enough time to influence them. Even if they find out your intentions towards them, even such a thing as intending for them to die to feed your hunger for their powers, they won’t decide to act against you so long as you are not being immediately hostile towards them and may still help their cause. They’ll definitely be watchful and wary of you from then on but will either believe there is a chance to redeem you or that you may yet be useful to them and will not reveal your true intentions to others or attempt to punish you.,,
Woodsman - Halfway There,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You really are new to this, you’ve not even fully completed your Reincarnation yet. That’s not to say that’s a bad thing. In fact, you seem to have a shocking amount of power already and more room to grow all over. As you use your Reincarnator power, you’ll slowly go through evolutions that severely increase the power it offers you and likely grant you some visual alteration when using it as well. Depending on the power, it may be two or even three different stages before it reaches its maximum level of progress through this ability, with each stage granting a hefty power boost. Unlike normal, this will apply to any Reincarnator power you buy in the later Powers section, despite them normally being unable to grow further, and also to any other power that you may possess, including ones that cannot normally grow in this fashion. They are subject to the same limitations as Reincarnator powers are through this perk however.,,
Sinful Soldier - Befriending the Bully,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Why let a bit of a nasty past get in the way of a burgeoning new friendship? If you look on the bright side, a dark past just means a more developed and experienced adult! With your optimistic nature, I assume, this means that the nastier a person is, the easier you’ll find it for the two of you to get along. Someone being a jerk actually makes it a tiny bit easier to befriend them while a cruel, vicious dictator responsible for millions off deaths can become a close friend in just a few days of talking together. Of course, those nasty guys and girls rarely let someone spent enough time around them anyway.,,
Sinful Soldier - Spymaster,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Unlike the Forest of the Greats, you’ve been gathered alongside a large variety of Reincarnators, from the incredibly strong to the most basic and weak. That variety of experience and your own canny mind has taught you much about powers. Just by seeing a power used once, you are able to figure out everything about that power. You know all it can do, all its limitations and all its strengths. You even know connected powers to that one in lesser detail. If someone has multiple powers, you won’t learn anything about the ones they haven’t used in front of you but your ability to understand powers works just as well on recordings. On the other hand, your power does not tell you every possible use of the power in conjunction with other things or the environment, just what it can do alone, so be careful to not get overconfident.,,
Sinful Soldier - Developmental Block,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The struggle against your inner nature is one most Sinners will be familiar with. Their ancestor begins to affect them more and more as time goes on and as they use their powers power, forcing those dark urges to grow and grow. Except not for you. Not only do these urges not grow for you, you seem to be able to limit growth in yourself in any way you like. You’re able to forcibly stop the rising temptation to give in to the nature of a Sinner, grind to a halt the progression towards a Perfect Reincarnator state or even stop yourself growing in power, if you for some reason desired that to happen. At any time you can start your growth back up again in whatever you’ve limited.,,
Sinful Soldier - Simply Perfect,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,An old hand at the whole reincarnation thing, are you? You’re a genuinely Perfect Reincarnator, having become able to maintain the transformation for as long as you want. Unlike other Perfect Reincarnators though, you don’t need to have any visual changes in this state and can retain the powers despite having a normal appearance. You’ll still feel the urges of a Reincarnator however. Achieving this Perfect state has also shown you how to slowly grow other transformations towards a permanent state as well, making them last longer and longer as you use them more and more until you never need to shut them off again. Once they reach this stage, you can cancel any visual changes like you can with the Reincarnator form, though any other side effects will remain.,,
Independent - Slasher Skills,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf? Just about anyone who’s ever had you come after them. You’ve got an innate talent for hunting other people which was only built on to incredible levels by the years of specialised training you went through in the military to hone your skills. You can track fleeing men across entire countries and bait experienced soldiers into traps or the areas you want them to get into. You’re no better than before at sealing the deal but when it comes to finding and corralling your prey, you’re one of the best around.,,
Independent - Fists of Modern Fury,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Sealing the deal? Pshaw, you’ll do more than that. You’ve got the talent and skill to make yourself far beyond what even world class martial artists consider possible here. Barehanded against a squad or three of highly trained, fully loaded Special Forces operatives? They’d been scraping their remains off the wall, quite literally, whilst you’d waltz out of there whistling away. Not only are you a brilliant martial artist, your martial arts also manage to hurt people regardless of the weird abilities they have. It won’t bypass durability or the natural material of their bodies, so don’t try to punch some kind of slime person, but they can’t negate your martial moves with any kind of esoteric ability. They won’t be rewriting the past to get rid of any bruises you’ve given them or using supernatural shields to stop your kicks reaching them.,,
Independent - Getting Together a Team,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,With how big the world is, finding the very few capable of Reincarnating is a challenge. Finding those who possess the talents to one day have their own Reincarnators? Damn near impossible. But you make it work. For you, finding and even recruiting to your cause those who share the same traits or powers as you is an easy task. Even when they’re a one in a million or rarer occurrence, you can find people with similar or the same type of powers as you in just days and, so long as they’re not already affiliated with a rival group, easily convince them to give joining your side a go. Any trait you yourself have can be searched for in this way, from personality traits to types of powers to skillsets to even partner preferences, though it won’t be able to find anything that doesn’t exist in the world.,,
Independent - Natural Genius,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,If you were going to be as lazy and half-hearted as to give up all hope and rely on your ancestors for a free ride in life...well, you’d probably just have killed yourself a while ago. You’re no Reincarnator. You’re a natural, modern day Great Person. Whatever ability you may have gained from the Ancestor section is instead an innate power unique to you, always active and free of any compulsions to act in any way you do not wish to. It’s your power, not borrowed from someone else. Amazingly enough, despite already being the sort of person to one day be used as an Ancestor, you’re able to develop even more powers. By accomplishing great things, you can have those accomplishments turn into incredible abilities. For you, the greater the accomplishment, the greater the power you’ll receive from it. Strangling a few hundred people and becoming well known for it may just result in supernaturally strong arms while changing the entire world with your discovery and popularisation of easy electricity use may leave you able to tear apart entire cities with lightning bolts sent from your fingers.,,
Ancestors,,1,,00,,False,,False,,You’re descended from some great figure, who wasn’t exactly like they were in the history books. Those who accomplish great or terrible, or both, things in life gain powers to match their deeds. A Reincarnator, what you are now, is a modern day person who is able to summon the powers, appearance and even memories of that ancestor to use as their own. They do this with the use of Branches of Rinne, special knives that when used to slit the wielders own throat, summon a flurry of red petals from the wound and activate the Reincarnator state.%%%%Reincarnators begin in an incomplete form, only able to temporarily access a small portion of the power and appearance of their Ancestor. As they use their power more and more, they will unlock more of their Ancestors abilities and begin to appear more and more like them. However, this comes at the cost of urges. Urges that match the Ancestor. People who did Great Things will urge their Reincarnators to aspire to Great Things as well, taking on some personality traits of their Ancestor and possibly even forgetting their own original selves if they don’t spend time with their original lives. Ancestors who became known because of their Sins are more unfortunate. Known as Sinners, those who Reincarnate as one of these beings will uncover a drive to do terrible things to other people. This drive will only grow as time goes by.%%%%It should also be noted that most Reincarnators possess naturally superhuman physical abilities, moving at speeds at least as great as an Olympic sprinter with ease and being able to punch through stone or thick trees with little real effort.%%%%You are a little unique as a Reincarnator. While you are technically incomplete as a Reincarnator, you possess the full powers of your ancestor, meaning the only benefit you will see over time is a longer lasting and eventually permanent transformation. You also lack any urges, even if you choose a Sinner for your Ancestor. Even if you do become a Perfect Reincarnator, you’ll be able to drop in and out of that state as you will.%%%%The following list will detail all possible Ancestors that you may choose. More than one may be bought, though they must be activated separately and grown separately. You receive a 200CP discount on your first purchase, if this would reduce a power to 0CP or less you receive it for free.,,
Isaac Newton,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,One of the most famous scientists in history, the man who formulated the law of gravity, motion and other kinetic objects. Calling back to the way he was first inspired, Newton grants you the ability to create a limitless number of apples. You are able to control gravity within 4 metres of these apples, with enough force to crush people to gooey puddles or even partially bend space around them. Newton also makes his Reincarnators have heads that look exactly like giant apples.,,
Albert Einstein,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Another great scientist of the world, this time the man who created the theory of relativity and more besides. Einstein’s studies resulted in a power that allowed him to teleport between two spaces, now passed down to you. You are able to, by sticking out your tongue, teleport instantaneously between any two spaces. You’re also able to selectively take anyone or anything within a few feet of you with you, including only parts of people if you wish to cause some rather horrific injuries. However, you can only teleport to spaces you have physically been present in, the exact spaces mind, and that space significantly changing or being damaged will erase the record of you having been there and prevent you from teleporting there until you’ve physically moved there again.,,
Adolf Hitler,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The fearsome Nazi leader himself. The Great Sinner’s descendants inherit his ability to see into and understand the hearts of other humans with ease, as well as a unique ability based on the Hakenkreuz, the Nazi symbol. You are able to share with the senses of any living being in contact with this symbol, no matter how far they are from you. You can even simultaneously view and comprehend the sensory information of all beings wearing the Hakenkreuz at once. When this ability is active, your eyes will have the Hakenkreuz visible in each eyeball.,,
Charles Joseph Whitman,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,An American mass murderer who used a rifle to slay his victims, his descendants inherit a curious marksman based ability. By shooting when the second hand of a clock strikes the 12 spot, your shots will never miss, though they can be blocked. If a clock is not available, one can be summoned to float behind you as you wait for the clock to strike twelve.,,
Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,A Russian serial killer who mutilated and murdered over 50 women and children in his lifetime. The Red Ripper of Russia grants large clawed hands to his Reincarnators, claws that can split and bisect anything their bladed edges touch, no matter how tough or hard the material that is being targeted is.,,
Vlad III,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The man who inspired Dracula himself, Vlad Tepes, prince of Wallachia and renowned impaler. Befitting his favourite hobby, his Reincarnators gain the ability to create spikes from any nearby surface that extend and pierce anything the user wishes. Dozens of spikes can be created in an instant, strong enough to form a shield against many attacks too.,,
Simo Hayha,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The legendary Finnish sniper who stopped a section of the Russian Army in its’ tracks all on his own. Simo grants a range of abilities to his descendant. The first is incredible eyesight, enough to notice the glint off of a sniper rifle from hundreds of metres away. The second is a truly absurd degree of marksmanship, enough to not only kill men from miles away with ease but also to shoot sniper bullets out of the sky fired from almost a mile away just by seeing the glint of the sniper rifle that fired it. Your true power is to summon the White Hell however. By catching an enemy in the scope of a gun, you can force them into a pocket dimension that is an immense snowfield in the middle of a blizzard, making it difficult to see and hard to hear anything. Time flows much faster in this dimension, seconds passing on the outside even as hours long sniper battles rage within. Finally, you may summon a gigantic white sniper rifle, with fittingly large bullets, at will.%%%%Alternatively you may purchase Carlos Norman Hathcock, the White Feather, as your Ancestor for the same price. Possessing all the same abilities except for Snow Hell, he instead holds one that fits his time in Vietnam as a legendary American Sniper. Instead of Snow, Hathcock creates the Green Hell, a massive pocket dimension filled with a dense and stifling jungle that suits his style of sniping.,,
Albert Hamilton Fish,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,An American serial killer, child rapist and cannibal, also known as the Werewolf. His particular diet now manifests as an outright superpower. By feeding on human flesh, you are able to heal any wounds that you have and also grow stronger, quicker and bigger on a permanent basis. Even just a few corpses is enough to put you well into the range of horror movie monsters. Your senses also heighten as your other attributes described above grow, making you into a better and better hunter of men.,,
John Von Neumann,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Brilliant mathematician and creator for the first computer, Neumann’s mathematical abilities earned him a demonic nickname and they’ve become an equally demonic power in usefulness. You are able to understand the world in the form of maths, instantly computing problems that would take supercomputers weeks to solve, and thus figure out the most likely future possibilities of any scenario. Using this knowledge you can predict the moves someone will make in a fight and the best ways to respond to them, provided you have all the info. It’s great for gathering information on people but as it only deals with the numbers you know, you can still be surprised if you don’t keep yourself up to date on your enemies.,,
Musashi Miyamoto,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The famed dual wielding swordsman from Japan, though it seems that he became something altogether quite monstrous as he grew in age and skill. When activated, this power grants the user a transformed state resembling that of a black skinned devil. Possessing twelve arms, each with a supernaturally sharp sword, the state bestows superhuman strength and speed onto the user. Musashi is able to move faster than the human eye can track and cut with enough force that the mere air pressure of the blade’s swings will be enough to cut through castle walls. You also gain all the immense skill of Musashi at wielding the 12 katanas you now hold, making you a legendarily good swordfighter.,,
Hiroshi Funasaka,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,A legendary Japanese soldier from World War 2 who could survive injuries that would kill any other man and easily heal from them to get up and continue fighting in just days. Hiroshi grants two abilities to his Reincarnator.%%%%The first is a sort of Immortality, regenerating you from even fatal wounds so long as you have stamina left. Even being reduced to a charred skeleton would be healed in seconds, so long as some part of your body is left and your stamina yet remains.%%%%The second is that you can instantly create out of thin air any weapon that an infantryman might have in your current time, from grenades to rifles to submachine guns. There is no limit to how many or cost to creating them, save that they disappear once they leave your hands for a few seconds.,,
Bobby Fischer,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,World famous chess champion Bobby Fischer had his love for the game become something far more powerful. As his Reincarnator, you gain two main abilities.%%%%The first allows you to always be aware of every possible tactic and move in any situation, though not which tactic is the right one to make.%%%%The second allows you to summon an entire half of a chess set as giant golems. You summon the entire white side as golems that stand over twice as tall as an adult man and possess supernatural strength, speed and endurance. They share your vision and your thoughts, allowing you to instantly command any of them or all of them at once.%%%%If all 15 golems are destroyed, you are able to summon 4 more irregular chess golems- Nightrider, Grasshopper, the Buffalo and the Cardinal. Each of these is several times stronger than a normal chess golem and follows the same rules. Any broken golems will be able to be resummoned once the current battle has ended.,,
Hans Driesch,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The German biologist responsible for the first successful cloning attempts of animals. Driesch cloning experiments have gone much further here, manifesting in the ability to create vials that, when broken, create an exact replica of yourself. Each clone also retains the ability to create test tubes that will then result in even more clones once produced. The clones are no stronger than you yourself are normally but can be used to overwhelm stronger enemies with sheer numbers or as shields when needed.,,
Pol Pot,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The revolutionary who became one of the most brutal tyrants in all of history. Pol Pot passes down the ability to control rot to his descendants. Through your hands you can emit a black aura that rots anything it touches, from people to plants to even rocks and metals. The rotting aura can almost instantly destroy anything it touches. It has a maximum range of 50 metres for every use, though the aura does not instantly extend to this range and is possible to dodge, and each use must also be separated by a one second recharge time.,,
Hans Ulrich Rudel,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,The German bomber pilot of World War 2 who destroyed countless vehicles, including entire battleships, on his own and also survived many crashes without a scratch on him. A supposedly immortal man who passed this immortality to you.%%%%So long as you have stamina, you cannot be touched by any attacks. Any attack attempted against you will be met with an opposing force that utterly negates it, rendering you untouchable so long as your stamina, which drains as you are protected against attacks, remains present to fuel you.%%%%You also possess the ability to summon and wield any sort of weapon used by an aircraft in the history of the modern Earth, such as gigantic Gatling guns or barrages of powerful air-to-ground bombs.%%%%You’re also able to jump dozens of meters into the air with ease.,,
Gaius Julius Caesar,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,The great betrayed hero of Rome and one of its’ greatest generals.%%%%Fitting his reputation, you are granted a vast amount of skill at military strategy, easily enough to lead even tiny forces to victory against vast armies.%%%%You are also given even further enhanced physical strength, enough to destroy whole houses in single blows.%%%%You possess a support ability that grants you the highest possible level of skill with any weapon that you wield when you are holding it.%%%%Finally, your main ability is that of Military Summoning. You are able to summon any kind of weapon, armour or even mount that has been commonly present in an army you have commanded, even in great amounts. Blades of all different kinds, cannons, horses, great suits of plate armour are all the sorts of things that you are able to summon at first.,,
Jean-Henri Fabre,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,A famed French naturalist that loved to study insects, his long hours spent studying insects in the quiet have given a special stealth power to you.%%%%Being almost like absolute stealth, you are able to completely hide your appearance, smell, sounds and even presence from anyone else. While those with certain kinds of supernatural senses can still detect you, it is also possible to detect you by feeling you in some way, as your physical touch is not erased. If you were in a pool of water, you would still make splashes and ripples around your body for instance, even if that body could not be seen.%%%%However, you also possess the ability to create injectors filled with special insecticides that can instantly kill any biological being that they are injected into, though one must get extremely close to do so as the injectors are quite fragile.,,
Charles Darwin,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Brilliant scientist and father of the theory of evolution, Darwin’s power reflects his life’s work.%%%%You are able to take on the form and/or traits of any living thing on Earth, playing mix and match with the varied ecosystems of the world. The size of an elephant but the build of a gorilla, the punching fists of a pistol shrimp and the wings of a dragonfly. There’s no limit to what your creativity can achieve and nor do you seem to need to adhere to the normal biological limitations of what you turn yourself into, such as weight restrictions and the like.%%%%While initially limited to normal Earth life forms, you may add creatures from other worlds, even supernatural ones, by extensively studying and coming to understand comprehensively their biology.,,
Goemon Ishikawa,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,A famous Japanese outlaw, whose accomplishments were believed to be mostly mythical because of how fantastic they were. His legendary thieving skills grew into the dual power you now possess in this state. Goemon grants the user two powers, one in each of their arm, that become glowing black appendages when in use.%%%%Their Right Arm is the Arm of Thievery, able to selectively ignore any outside influences to steal things, allowing the user to phase their arm through objects and steal things within those objects before phasing back out. Taking all of someone’s blood without leaving an entry wound is as easy as stealing a section of a rock to hide within the resulting hole. This arm can also be used to steal powers from other beings, which are then utilised with the left arm, the Arm of Usage.%%%%This arm is the one through which all stolen powers are channelled, though the powers are only degraded versions of the originals.,,
Xiang Yu,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,A mighty warlord from the time of the Qin Dynasty in China, responsible for the deaths of countless thousands of people. This might and brutality manifests in a power made to conquer the very world itself.%%%%You are able to create immense amounts of a black aura that allows you to control anything that the aura touches. The ground that it touches can be crafted into a massive golem capable of moving and attacking on its own, the bodies of your enemies can be twisted into gruesome messes if they come into contact with your aura and so on. You may turn into your aura to render yourself intangible and almost impossible to hurt, given you can control the attacks that touch your aura.%%%%The aura is able to move much faster than you yourself can, making turning into it an easy way to travel long distances and even carry other people within the aura with you.%%%%The one limitation of the power is that it must be consciously used and thus attacks you do not react to in time can pierce through your defences.,,
Leonardo Da Vinci,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,The great polymath and Renaissance man himself, master of many disciplines and as it turns out, many powers too. You have become a Universal Vessel, capable of learning anything from anyone. Not only do you absorb months or years of information within days, you are also able to learn what shouldn’t be able to be learned, such as gaining powers by having the holders of powers teach you about their abilities. A few days or weeks of tutelage is enough to start to gain the ability, with it rapidly growing to match the original as you continue to receive their teachings. There is no limit to what you can learn nor how many things you can learn at once in this way, just that you are being actively taught them by somebody or something that possesses those powers.,,
Erwin Schrodinger,,1,,-10000,,True,,True,,An Austrian Physicist famous for his studies into Quantum Physics, particularly his experiments with felines. The Schrodinger’s Box experiment resulted in a particularly scary probability based power being passed onto you. At all times, you know the probability of success of all actions you may take in that moment and with a thought, you may choose to enforce whatever possible route you see. So long as a particular event is possible to happen, you are able to force it to happen. A firing squad would miss every shot at you, even if you stood still and let them take a hundred retries. Similarly, you could kill every one of those men with a single bullet even with no shooting skills of your own. If an action or event is impossible however, you will be left helpless with this power against it. Schrodinger also makes his Reincarnators have the heads of cats when they turn into him.,,
Branch of Rinne,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The curved knife used by Reincarnators to awaken their powers. By slitting your own throat with this blade, you’ll allow the petals of reincarnation to begin to flow out of the wound and bring out your inner powers for a short time. This wound will not actually hurt you and will heal up once you exit your transformation. Eventually, you’ll be able to stay in your transformed state for as long as you like though if you drop out for any reason, you’ll need this knife again. Thankfully the knife will always be in your hand when you need it to transform.%%%%For an extra 300 CP, you may purchase a case of twelve Branches that work for other people in other worlds. Each of these knives will either work if the user has an appropriately Great or Sinful Ancestor or simply fail to cut them if they do not, leaving them unharmed.,,
Woodsman - Comms Network,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A set of a dozen modern smartphones, all linked to each other. No matter how far each phone is from each other, they’ll always be able to communicate to any other of the set, though they may not be able to do so with outside phones or devices. The transmissions cannot be interrupted or jammed but it is possible to intercept them if you don’t take means to prevent that yourself. It’s also very easy to keep your attentions on your surroundings when using the phones.,,
Woodsman - Broadcaster,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A portable satellite, though it seems to have been upgraded from the original model to fly under its own power. This cabinet sized satellite is able to act as a telecommunications hub or a broadcast system for just about any sort of device you’d like. It’s got a range of about thirty kilometres and can fly about as fast as the average modern day car can drive. It’s surprisingly hard to shoot down too, swaying out of the way of all shots aside from those with supernatural accuracy or when there’s just no room to move. Communications sent through this satellite are impossible to intercept, hack or interfere with in any way.,,
Woodsman - Hidey Hole Fort,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,A huge cavern has been hollowed out underground or within the core of a mountain for you, set up to be a brand new base for you. Equipped with a very high tech surveillance system capable of keeping watch over an entire city, at least if it’s nearby, it’s also got the facilities to support the daily lives of around two dozen people at once with ease. Finding the base through any means aside from physically tracking people to it is also impossible, as is attempts to teleport or remotely view into the inside of the underground base.,,
Woodsman - Gathering of Greats,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,Jumper’s Great Forest has gathered to hear your commands. You are the head of a newly minted secret organisation of Greats, major figures from around the world that have the power to change it if used wisely. Your organisation consists of at most twenty or so strong beings, perhaps Reincarnators or perhaps even natural Great People of the modern day. They are very loyal to you and regardless of their individual beliefs, incredibly easy for you to manipulate into doing even actions they should normally find reprehensible. In future worlds you will be the head of a similar small organisation, consisting of ten to twenty powerful beings in each new world. They won’t be world changers on their own but working together and with good leadership, they can definitely manage to do Great Things.,,
Sinful Soldier - Seat of Power,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This massive throne is fit for a king or maybe just a Jumper. Just. The throne is of a design and material of your choice, so long as you don’t get too crazy, and seems almost completely impervious to damage. It appears instantly for you whenever you have need of a seat and no one else is looking, apparently the throne is too shy to appear when others might see the process of unveiling itself. It’s very comfortable, no matter what it’s made out of, and makes a fantastic shield in an emergency. Doesn’t hurt that it’s quite imposing.,,
Sinful Soldier - Sadistic Symbology,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,In this day and age, if you want to stand out, you’ve got to have a good theme going for you. If you’re covered in clashing colours, you’ll just be ugly. Taking this option doesn’t just let you make sure everything fits, it’ll keep making sure all your future stuff fits too. You’re able to restyle everything you own to fit a certain theme, such as a....German theme for instance, and continue to instantly restyle anything you come to own in the future to match too. You’re also able to plaster a symbol of your choice all over everything you own and even anything you touch that’s willing or unable to say no to you putting your chosen symbol on them. If you like, you can change the theme or symbol, but this means changing everything both of those are on too.,,
Sinful Soldier - Dark Castle,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,You’re definitely not going for subtle. You’re the new master of a great big castle somewhere out in the countryside, surrounded by deep forests. The castle is at the back of a large plot of land entirely encircled by high walls, apparently it’s impossible to enter from any point save the front of those walls. Once entered, there are two extra, smaller fortresses on either side of the plot of land that guard the only clear paths towards the great castle at the back. Any sort of remote observation tool doesn’t work here, even supernatural abilities fail, and it’s almost impossible to not get lost in the forest. Those who don’t want to spend hours slowly picking through its dense mass will need to travel along the heavily guarded paths through one of the two smaller fortresses if they want to get to the castle.,,
Sinful Soldier - The Bad Organisation,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,A new bad guy organisation has formed or at least it appears so to any outsider. Regardless of whether or not they are actually evil, you find yourself to be the new head of an up and coming ‘evil organisation’. You’ve got five powerful lieutenants, each a great power in the world such as a high class Reincarnator, and a few hundred low class soldiers. It wouldn’t be very nice to call them mooks but...it’s what they really are. They’re still Reincarnators, just very low level ones. At the very least, it’s a lot easier to recruit new low level soldiers to replace any you lose and you even find it quite easy to bring over existing nasty bad guys, though they might get a bit of a surprise if they find out you’re not as bad as your organisations reputation says you are. You’ll be the head of a similar organisation in future worlds, having five powerful captains and a few hundred low level powered soldiers to help out.,,
Independent - Soldier Do,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The latest and greatest in military clothing. This all black, full covering combat suit is the best money can buy when it comes to stealth and defence in the modern world. Built in armour that doesn’t hinder movement allow bullet proof vest like protection across the entire body whilst remaining just as firm against edged or pointed weapons. Softening most noises made in movement and even coming with a range of high tech eyewear for night or thermal vision, you’ve got everything you’d need for an infiltration mission, save for actual weapons. Aside from the weapon that is your body.,,
Independent - Killing Grounds,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,An obscure area is created new your starting location. It’s a Killing Ground, an area perfectly suited for your fighting and killing styles, about the size of a large clearing and almost impossible to find without hours of searching, even when it really shouldn’t be that hard to find. This area significantly improves your combat efficiency while you are in it and even makes for a fantastic place to hide any bodies, given how hard it is to fine.,,
Independent - Dark Complex,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,When will the Military-Industrial complexes expansionist policies end?! Given how much it’s about to benefit you, I wouldn’t worry too much. You’ve somehow come into the legal and authorised possession of an abandoned military complex. It’s got enough facilities and buildings to house a force of a few hundred men and even the armoury to supply them with weapons and a few decent vehicles. Beneath the complex is the real draw though. A prison built for those with special powers. As long as the prisoner is incapacitated before being placed in the cell, they’ll be completely unable to break out without outside help. There’s about twenty cells in all. You’ll receive a similar military complex in your name in future worlds.,,
Independent - The R-Team,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The modern world is well aware of the existence of Reincarnators, at least when it comes to the highest echelons of the world. They’ve put together a task force to deal with any troubles they may cause and put you at the helm of this new Special Forces group. The best of the best from around the world have gathered, including a few dozen modern day Great People with powers of their own, and the task force has the support of many countries from around the world, giving it a great deal of influence and resources to draw on.%%%%This support and the combatants serving you are given with the expectation that you will serve the world and, more importantly, the individual countries. It’ll be a balancing act to satisfy the whims of each contributing superpower and lesser country as upsetting them may see them withdraw their wealth and offered warriors from your group. That is, if you don’t convince the recruits that they’re better off with you than anyone else. You’ll find yourself at the head of a similar group in all future worlds, which may become an awkward position depending on the world.,,
Import,,3,,-500,,False,,False,,Few are those who fight alone in this world. It seems to be a natural tendency for Reincarnators to gather together in groups, perhaps the same can be said of you. For every purchase of this option, you may import one existing companion or create one new companion. They’ll gain a free origin, all associated benefits, and 600CP to spend on perks and Ancestor powers. They do not gain a discount on any Ancestor powers.,,
Canon,,3,,-1000,,False,,False,,But you may have already made friends here or at least been looking to make some. In that case, you can take this option for the chance of bringing someone along with you. Every purchase gives you the chance to take along a specific character with you as a companion from this jump. You’ll need to convince them to come but you’ll be helped along by a range of coincidences that cause you two to meet often in favourable conditions.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,You may take up to 600CP in drawbacks,,
Varied Interpretations,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Not every Ancestor passes down a human appearance to their Reincarnator. Despite how absurd it may seem given actual history, your ancestor was quite blatantly inhuman and you’ve inherited those traits. Your head might look like an apple or just be a cat or dog head. You might be some sort of misshapen, gaunt monster with a clearly inhuman shape or, if you somehow don’t have an ancestor to draw on, just be quite ridiculously ugly. You won’t be able to turn this inhuman appearance off either, even outside of your transformed state.,,
Born Without It,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Unlike the normal state of affairs, you seem to lack any qualifying ancestors to be a Reincarnator. You don’t even seem good enough to qualify as a Great Person in your own right. You’re totally unable to purchase from the Ancestor section or otherwise gain any new powers in this jump, though all your stuff from other jumps will still work. Maybe you could still make your way in the world with actual human ingenuity, instead of supernatural powers.,,
Red Blooded Misandrist,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Is it really fair to blame an entire gender for the actions of one man who hurt you a long time ago? Well, no one ever said hatred was a fair feeling. Years ago you were badly hurt and humiliated by a man and you’ve come to rather violently hate every member of the male gender since then, normally just going by insults and complete refusal to be near them but often coming to violence if they stay near you. Even if you are yourself a man, though at least you’re able to exclude your own self from this feeling. If you spend enough time around a good man and get to know and work with him for a few years, you could be able to overcome this feeling, but it’ll be a one at a time deal for most.,,
To Be Continued,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Closure is a right? You think you deserve a climax? Oh Jumper, you’re so naïve. This world isn’t obligated to let you have a satisfying finish at all. In fact, you seem almost cursed to never get a worthwhile ending, if you get an ending at all. Events seem to just trail off and never get continued when you’re a part of them, stories left unfinished and plots left inconclusive. Even when you do get an ending to something, like achieving victory in some task you set for yourself, you’ll always find it to be ruined in at least a small way. Just that little bit of the finish rendered unsatisfying for you to taint the whole experience.,,
Wheels,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Life’s a lot harder when you don’t have the freedom to move on your own. You’d better get used to it, since you’ve lost the use of both of your legs for the extent of your time here. An accident in your childhood rendered both legs entirely useless, though they do not appear damaged from the outside, and you’ll need to either be carried around or set in a wheelchair, unless you want to drag yourself around by the arms.,,
Dinner for Sinners,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Normally, you wouldn’t suffer any urges in your time here. Taking this changes that situation quite severely. Now that you have taken this, you’ll be dealing with a particularly nasty Sinner urge for the duration of your stay. The longer you stay here, the stronger the urge to indulge in all manner of nasty sins will get. Giving in will only briefly alleviate the urge and it will return even stronger once you’ve finished indulging. The longer it goes on, the worse the acts you’ll feel the desire to do.,,
The Jumper Hunters,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,A nasty public incident in the past revealed your true nature to the leaders of the world. Believing you to be a threat as great or even greater than that of the various Reincarnator factions, they’ve decided to have their combined Special Forces group, made of the world’s modern Great People, to go after you and bring you in for a quick interrogation and quicker death. Even if you yourself were previously a member of this group, they’ll still turn on you and the countries of the world will only escalate to more dangerous solutions if you turn or wipe out their task force. A life on the run from some of the greatest hunters in the world is probably the best case scenario.,,
Incomplete Jumper,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You really are new to this all. You’ve barely even started to awaken to your powers, to any of them. You’re not just an incomplete Reincarnator, you’re an incomplete Jumper now. Every one of your powers is severely reduced in ability and organised into sets based on the jumps you got them from. To use any of these powers, you must activate them like you would a Reincarnator power, slitting your throat to gain them back at a greatly reduced level. You can only have one active at a time and each set will slowly, as you use it more and more, grow back to its full power and duration. It’d take at least a few months of daily use to manage that for even a single power set however.,,
I Will Become Talented,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,There’s a lust within you, a dream-no, a desire to prove yourself. To whom doesn’t matter much, only that you prove yourself capable of all you do. Your constant desire to prove yourself to be the superior is an overriding force in your mind, driving almost everything you do. You’ll even go so far as to kill those who have willingly allied themselves with you for a chance at more power, more wealth and more influence. The world has become nothing more than a stepladder for you, with those closest to you turning into rungs for you to rise higher on. This drive will not just cause you to take advantage or harm those closest to you, it’s reckless onward momentum will often cause you to throw yourself into dangerous situations, made even more so by how you’ve driven away so many potential friends and allies.,,
