Universal Drawbacks,,6,,105000,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You awake in a small room in the Tavern of the Rising Sun. The owner Ogden greets you as you come downstairs, and the lovely barmaid Gillian serves you a simple morning meal. With everything that has happened recently, none of the townsfolk will question your sudden appearance, but being of service to Tristram will quickly endear you to the townsfolk.,,
Warrior,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Sanctuary is filled with soldiers, mercenaries, barbarians and many others who live by force of arms. Even demons can fall before well-crafted steel, and you need little else to carry you through the labyrinth.,,
Mage,,0,,00,,True,,False,,The Vizjerei and the other mage clans are the most well-known practitioners of magic, but there are others. Necromancers, druids, and isolated groups with their own unique practices are all able to sense the influence of Hell upon Sanctuary. That is why you have come here, to investigate the source of corruption within the labyrinth beneath Tristram.,,
Rogue,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Many more shady types have been lured to Tristram with the promise of wealth, or to strip the corpses of would-be heroes of anything valuable. Other merely make their way here disguised as one thing or another, the better to ply their skills without undue attention.,,
Drop In - Orb Drops,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,To save on potions, you've picked up a little trick that the rest of Sanctuary won't discover for a few more years. When slain, creatures will occasionally drop little blood-red or sapphire-blue globes. Representing health and energy, you can absorb the globes simply by passing withing arm's reach to heal yourself or recharge your reserves of MP, or whatever other supernatural energies you have access to.,,
Drop In - HP/MP,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,A long stretch of fighting can leave one exhausted and unsure if it's possible to continue. To better measure your chances of survival, you have a mental awareness of how hurt you are, and how much mystical energy remains within you to be tapped. It's not terribly detailed, but more than enough to tell the difference between a serious wound and a minor one (or a minor one that might become serious if aggravated) and how many spells you can reliably cast before hitting your limit.,,
Drop In - Item Drops,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Adventure is not its own reward - that's what loot is for. Stomp a spider, find a penny. Kill a demon, a magic sword pops out of its guts. Creatures now sometimes drop jump-appropriate money and gear upon their death, and stronger enemies mean more money and better loot.,,
Drop In - Yoink,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It's wonderful when a dead demon drops something valuable. It's terrible when someone else grabs and runs off with it. Since you've probably still got things to kill, slipping loot into your Warehouse (or other inventory space perk) is as easy as touching something with a moment's intent, and the loot is safely tucked away.%%%%You cannot move anything to the Warehouse in this fashion if it would not fit through the door normally.,,
Drop In - Linked Stash,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,To ease your travels, you gain access to a pocket dimension about the size of a small room that you can store items within, where time does not pass. Additionally, this stash is linked with your warehouse (and any other inventory space perks you possess) allowing you to freely manage and move items between them.%%%%As a extra bonus, you are able to partition the space provided by this and similar perks into more manageable tabbed sections, so that you can easily organize your storage and retrieve items faster by calling up a section dedicated to potions, weapons, etc instead of searching through your entire stash for the item you want.,,
Drop In - Both or Neither,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Are you an angel? Or are you a demon? Technically you're both. But what's in a label? You have the freedom to be defined however you want, and to not be bound by previous choices. Did you pick up a relic that can only be used by a virgin? Well, everyone was a virgin at one point. Find a sword that can't be swung unless you've killed a sibling? Sure, you did that once in a previous jump.%%%%You may include or exclude any aspect of yourself, past or present, from your current 'state of being' when mystical effects are concerned, preventing them from recognizing you as something to target or restrict based on a particular feature or past choice of yours.,,
Drop In - No Fate,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are your own person, and you alone decide what path you will follow. Not heaven, not hell, and certainly not some two-bit wizard with magic dice. Attempts to manipulate probability fall flat when used against you, whether that is someone trying to curse you with bad luck, or grant themselves good luck while working against you. This also means that your future is unreadable by mystical means, and the influence on that events that you partake in impossible to account for.,,
Warrior - Strength of Arms,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You are massively strong beyond what any mortal should be capable of. Heft a horse, kick down a solid oak door, go toe-to-toe with a demon twice your size, and do it all after sprinting for an hour in full armor.,,
Warrior - Tools of War,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,As wanderer, mercenary, paladin, or humble town guard, you've had years to gain experience in combat and familiarize yourself will all manner of weapons.%%%%That same time was spent far away from any proper forge, and so you have also learned how to properly maintain your gear with substandard tools, keeping them functional long after you should have been carrying nothing but rags and dulled steel.,,
Warrior - War Cry,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,By primal scream or holy admonishment, your voice carries great weight. Even above the din of battle, your words grant allies a burst of vigor and shake the resolve of your enemies. One can only be inspired so much so often, so this talent is best used at suitably dramatic moments when the right bit of inspiration can swing the odds in your favor.,,
Warrior - Holy Impact,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You can concentrate your strength and release it in a single mighty burst to propel yourself into the air or through obstructions on the ground. An ordinary person could easily leap from the ground to a building's second story, or smash through piles of rubble and hastily-erected barricades.%%%%You may also choose release the energy of your movement gently, only using this perk to move around faster, or you can deliver bone-crunching bodyslams, or land from a jump with enough force to crush the weak underfoot and blow away any standing nearby.,,
Warrior - Aura of (Perk),,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You can share the effects of a single perk you possess with others. It will take time and practice for the granted blessing to match the benefit you personally gain from it, as well as to increase the range of this ability. At first reaching only a few meters, in time you can gift a perk to all allies in sight. It will take you about a minute or so to change which perk you have chosen to share.,,
Warrior - Iron Skin,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Weathered by the elements and scourged by the flames of hell, you remain unbowed. You will not falter, having the will to fight on through fatigue, pain, and horror and emerge victorious. Your body has become a worthy receptacle of your will, having endured just as much and become stronger for it.%%%%Your skin has become like armor, turning aside weak blows and pitiful spells alike, while stronger attacks and magics are blunted somewhat.,,
Warrior - Elemental Fury,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,When steel alone is insufficient, your soul calls forth Sanctuary's wrath in battle. A thrown javelin becomes wreathed in lightning. Wind like razors carry the force of your swings deep into enemy ranks. A dagger-strike is deepened as shards of ice form within your victim.%%%%These and other effects are called forth by your attacks, but the cost is demanding. Those untrained in the mystic arts find it drawing upon their stamina, leaving a single strike feeling like an hour of exertion. Mages and stranger practitioners may substitute other energies for this cost, but the process is no less demanding.%%%%Years of training and many battles will be required before you can evoke these forces with any regularity, but mastering this gift will see you stride across the battlefield with the force of a natural disaster.,,
Mage - Diamond Mind,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Your intelligence soars, the better to unravel the arcane secrets of the world. Long study and practice have granted you deeper reserves of magical energy, and even when not in meditation, your reserves refill faster than less attentive students of the mystic arts.,,
Mage - Loremaster,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,When working with magic or cleaving through hordes of demons, it is often the minutiae that makes all the difference. Besides having an eidetic memory, recalling pertinent information is effortless on your part as your mind automatically appends useful facts, such as known magical properties or elemental weaknesses, to your current object of interest.,,
Mage - Glorious Thing of the Whatever,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have long studied the process of creating enchanted items, and have reached the point that any item you craft acquires a minor enchantment with no extra effort on your part.%%%%This enchantment is random, but it's always associated in some way to the function of the item, and you instinctively know the details. This inborn enchantment is so intrinsic to the item that it never interferes with any later magical tinkering you may perform with or upon it.%%%%You may choose to suppress this ability.,,
Mage - Stay Awhile and Listen!,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have endured listening to lecture after lecture from your elders, perused thousands of musty tomes, and have trained yourself to notice the useful information and skim past the dross. You read and absorb information at an insane pace, and you can navigate even the most obtuse library systems with ease.%%%%You've gone on to train your sixth sense to do the same, picking up the faintest hints of mystical phenomena to quickly suss out the details of their nature.,,
Mage - Elemental Magic,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Of all the powers available to a mage, the elemental forces are considered the safest and most reliable to use. This is not to say that they are weak. You wield lightning, fire and ice to wipe demons from the face of Sanctuary with skill great enough to create flexible manifestations of power.%%%%It is as easy to create blizzards of icicles the size of spears as it is craft lightweight armor out of iron-hard ice, summon beasts of flame imbued with a spark of self-direction, or direct lightning across the battlefield in a hundred different ways.,,
Mage - Violent Life,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Incompatable with Peaceful Death%%%%Following the philosophy of the Caoi Dúlra, you have gained power through communion with the world itself. Stone, fire, and storms dance at your call, eager to destroy corrupt forces. Beasts and plants call you kin, and you understand them as easily as you understand other men, communicating with them and borrowing aspects of their strength.%%%%As your powers grow, this allows you to call ferocious animals and magical plants to aid you even where there are none, or even to fully immerse yourself in the beast, altering your form and gaining massive increases to your strength and resilience.,,
Mage - Peaceful Death,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Incompatable with Violent Life%%%%The priests of Rathma concern themselves with the balance of life and death, the flow of souls from life to death to rebirth. Though feared by outsiders, they practice iron discipline and hold greatest respect for the power they wield, calling forth lethal poison and carrying arms and armor of ancient bone when battle is joined.%%%%Even the vitality of demons can be crippled, siphoned away or turned against itself by the curses they wield, and when aid is needed, those whom outsiders call 'necromancer' can raise the dead to fight by their side, or summon spirits to inhabit nonliving matter to form mighty and tireless golems.,,
Mage - Binding and Banishing,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,The practice of summoning demons for various tasks was once quite common among the mage clans. Eventually forbidden by an edict enforced by an order of assassins, there still exists vast bodies of knowledge on the topic, knowledge which has fallen into your hands. You are a master summoner able to call forth and command all but the mightiest of beings, and your skill extends even further to include ghosts and spirits of all sorts - even angels, if you dare risk the ire of the high heavens.%%%%Only the strongest and most unruly of beings even have a chance to break your bindings or twist the intent of your commands, but you've still taken the precaution of mastering the arts of warding and banishment as well. The weakest of creatures not native to the plane of existence you dwell upon will not be able to approach, let alone attack you, and you can easily restrain or banish large groups of such entities at a time. Great effort will be required to handle stronger beings or hordes of lesser creatures with the same ease, but with careful preparation and barring unforeseen complications, you are very likely to emerge from such contests victorious.,,
Rogue - Deadshot,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Long years of training have made your movements swift and sure. Rarely does a blow strike you in even the most chaotic of melees, and it is child's play to draw a bead on a distant target while running, leaping or swinging across unstable ground. In either condition, such is your talent with projectiles that you can hit a target with almost certain precision.,,
Rogue - Sister to Rogues,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Against the strength of demons, discretion is often the better option. You are trained in the arts of stealth, how to hide, how to move silently, and how to blend in through changes in manner and garb. But you are also trained to see through deception, your senses honed to see through disguises and pick out the slightest sign of an impending ambush.,,
Rogue - Trapfinding,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Most demons prefer the use of pure brute force or subtle corruption, but some are weak enough that they resort to the basest of tricks, traps and deceptions. Like many mortals, actually.%%%%You have long practice in spotting, disarming, or at least avoiding mechanical and environmental traps.%%%%Indeed, you are almost prescient in that if you touch an object that has a trap connected to its operation, a momentary feeling of danger will warn you of an undiscovered threat.,,
Rogue - Improvised Enchantments,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,While not trained in the magical arts the same way the mages are, you've learned a few tricks.%%%%The first is runecarving, employing an ancient language of unknown origins that bestow different effects when engraved on pieces of equipment.%%%%The other practice uses gems harvested from magic-rich areas which can express some of their absorbed power through items they are attached to.%%%%Rune- carving and gem-cutting need tools prepared only with very simple rituals using common materials, and you are highly skilled with the mundane aspects of these crafts. On the downside, these pseudo-enchantments only stay functional as long as the gems and carvings remain intact.%%%%While roughly mixing enchantments usually results in magical mishaps and destroyed equipment, you've developed enough skill in judging their compatibility that this is almost never a concern.,,
Rogue - Valkyrie,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You will never be alone in battle. A ghostly form rises to aid you, protecting your flanks and striking at opponents that approach. Its power grows as the tempo of battle increases and danger mounts, becoming more defined in form, its appearance in some way reflective of the person it protects. Your Valkyrie grows in power as you do, but will never approach anywhere near your full strength unless you are in mortal danger, at which point it will expend all its power to protect you for a brief minute or two at most of frenzied strength.%%%%Assuming you survive your brush with death, the Valkyrie will be exhausted and will require about a day to recover before it will reappear at your side.,,
Rogue - Sightless Eye,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye takes its name from an ancient mirror that showed the future in its surface. A sacred object, the sisterhood learned from it how to develop their own 'Inner sight.' Far more limited in scope than the mirror, deep meditation allows for brief glimpses of future events that will most likely occur within a few day's time.%%%%When rushed or in combat, only a few second's foresight can be achieved, but even this is often just enough time to react to an attack that would have claimed a sister's life.,,
Rogue - Finishing Move,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Some foes are so incredibly durable that no amount of mortal effort can overcome their defenses, so you have instead learned to bypass them. Hit by hit, as foe is knocked off-balance, exposing weak points, their armor chipped away, an opening is created for a single, devastating attack.%%%%By building up a long string of constant hits without pause or disruption, one can greatly magnify the effects of the final, telling blow.%%%%This can be difficult in a heated battle especially when multiple opponents are involved, but the results are undeniable. With a strong enough set-up, the attacks this technique provides can pierce armor, disrupt protective spells, cripple and maim, or greatly reduce any defenses and resistances that may apply to your attack. No beast that believes itself invincible will ever again be so confident in battle after receiving one of these strikes.,,
White Gear,,2,,00,,True,,False,,All adventurers begin with basic but serviceable armor and weapons suited for them, no hunting for rags to armor yourself with required. You also have enough gold for a month of food and lodging.,,
Adventurer's Tome,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Banded in red and blue, this slim booklet contains an infinite number of pages. Tear one out, and toss it into the air to form a portal leading to the last town you slept in. Or place the page upon an item, and words will appear that describe its basic physical and magical properties.%%%%Pages must be used right away, and cannot be distributed. If lost or destroyed, an intact replacement will be in the next place you look for one.,,
Carving Kit,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,The tools within this leather satchel are of exceptional quality and have been ritually prepared for work with delicate magical reagents. Having these will make Gemcutting and runecarving much easier.%%%%A sheaf of paper in a waterproof scroll case notes useful details on several basic runes and the most common semi-precious gems, but it lacks details on multi-rune sequences and the rarest stones. Still, the papers make a good reference, and they will automatically update themselves when your discover now information through experimentation or research.%%%%If lost or destroyed, the kit will reappear in your possession the next day.,,
Mechanical Traps,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,While few in Sanctuary have developed the sciences in any great way, the Viz-Jaq'taar looked into other methods of producing weaponry after forswearing the use of magic among their number. The size of a few stacked dinnerplates, these mechanical devices can slice, shock, burn and necrotize the flesh of foes thanks to an ingenious combination of engineering and chemistry. Though the damage they deal is less than what a skilled mage can provide, they are completely non-magical and can easily be constructed with scraps and common compounds.%%%%You begin with a small supply, and know how to construct more.,,
Cow King's Leathers,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The three pieces of this set, a leather jack, oversized hooves worn as boots, and a horned bovine skull, smell faintly of hay and manure. It also makes the wearer look completely ridiculous. But each item bears enchantments of respectable power which are amplified further when all three pieces are worn together. In particular it makes you very lucky when it comes to finding gold and magical items, perhaps finding enough to justify being seen wearing it.%%%%You may import three accessories in place of the leather set pieces to gain these qualities, or a single suit of armor to gain the full, composite benefit. Along with the smell.,,
Horadric Malus,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,An ancient and heavily-enchanted hammer, this tool was built to aid in forging magical items. In layman's terms it regulates and stabilizes magical energies, preventing small mishaps, foreign mana flows, short pauses in the enchanting process and other such problems from ruining an enchanter's work.%%%%While items produced with the aid of the Malus are only slightly more powerful, they are much more resistant to mystical tampering and corruption.,,
Horadric Cube,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A copy of a ancient artifact created by the mage clans, which was itself a copy of an even older device, this engraved cube is a potent tool of alchemy and transformation. The cube's four most common uses are to repair, refine, transmute, or dismantle items.%%%%The cube can repair broken magical items to full functionality, though you may need to add in reagents to make up for lost mass and energy.%%%%Multiple items of the same type placed inside will be consumed to create a single slightly more potent version.%%%%Items can be transmuted into other items of a different shape yet similar nature, such as arrows into bolts.%%%%Finally, magical items can be fragmented, enchantments and power cleanly divided between each piece, a function commonly used to store dangerous items in a more manageable form.,,
Butcher's Cleaver,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,Heavy, clumsy, and poorly balanced, only a demon or a madman would look at this and consider it a weapon. But when a blow is landed the blade deals vicious wounds and leaves ragged cuts that bleed profusely. The cleaver itself is stained with blood and impossible to clean, and seems to radiate an unsubtle feeling of malice.%%%%You may import a weapon to gain these qualities.,,
Obsidian Ring of the Zodiac,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,A legend among older adventurers, almost all examples of this item have inexplicably vanished, and you now hold one of the very few that sill exist. The simple but powerful enchantments upon this ring boost all of the wearer's attributes and offer protection against both elemental attacks and hostile enchantments.%%%%You may import a piece of jewelry to gain these benefits.,,
Soulstone,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This skull-sized, rough-hewed lump of clear crystal was a prototype created by Tyrael before he crafted the soulstones used to capture the Prime Evils. Its capacity to hold spiritual energy is immense, able to imprison anything short of a true god. Unlike the later versions, this one is somewhat stronger and will make it much more difficult for imprisoned entities to communicate with or influence those nearby.%%%%You must restrain, weaken or command an entity somehow before it can be forced into the stone, but releasing it from imprisonment or transferring it to another medium is a simple matter for any trained mage.%%%%The stone itself is extremely durable but not indestructible.,,
Azurewrath,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Forged by Tyrael himself and entrusted to one of his most skilled lieutenants, blade and wielder were lost after an ill-fated assault on the Hellforge. Somehow this blade has come into your possession, and its immense power is now yours to wield.%%%%The sword is impossibly sharp and unnaturally quick in motion, wrapped in an aura of destructive magic and cold enough to quench hellfire. While wielding it the wielder's body is strengthened and his skills are enhanced. Those carrying it find heaven's light shining upon them, and undead that approach are severely weakened.%%%%The blade itself is effectively indestructible.,,
Anvil of Annihilation,,2,,-5000,,True,,True,,Among the many anvils of the Hellforge, this one was specifically designed to destroy angelic weapons and artifacts. Legend held that anything broken upon the anvil, no matter how powerful, would be forever negated.%%%%This is partially true - anything that is otherwise 'indestructible' can be destroyed by the power of the anvil, and it is thereafter impossible to create a perfect copy of what was destroyed.%%%%The only exception to this are those things which are intrinsically a part of something else, such as severed body parts or something that was projected or expressed by a separate source of power. It that case, somehow regenerating or restoring what was broken to full strength takes an extremely long time and great effort, and even then the new appendage may bear some sort of scar or blemish in memory of its ordeal upon the anvil.,,
Divine Figue / Infernal Booty,,3,,-2000,,True,,True,,A young angel or demon (of the gender of your preference) has decided to follow you in their travels, for their own reasons. They have 400cp to spend, but cannot purchase any perks costing more than 200cp. If you purchase this twice to have both an angelic and demonic companion, they both receive a free set of sexy PJs.,,
Hireling,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sanctuary is full of mercenaries, and you have earned the loyalty of one beyond what coin can purchase. Perhaps you traveled with one of the famous Iron Wolves, or a Sister of the Sightless Eye has sworn herself to your service.%%%%They receive the warrior, mage, or rogue background and its 100cp perks for free, and an additional 400cp to spend.,,
Canon Character,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,You have made an ally of a canon character during your time here. If you can convince them to accompany you, they will join you as a companion. Because they are too closely entwined with this setting's metaphysics, you cannot choose from among the Archangels or the Prime Evils, and Trag-Oul or similar beings tasked with important spiritual duties will not be willing to leave Sanctuary.,,
Companion Import,,3,,-4000,,False,,True,,Up to eight existing companions can be imported. They receive a background of their choice and its 100cp perk for free, along with 600cp to spend as they wish.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Maximum of 600 CP,,
Expired Potions,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,No matter who produces them, the potions you acquire just taste horrible. Even if you utilize other methods to heal yourself or recharge your energies, anything that accelerates the natural process will be accompanied by some very unpleasant sensations. This won't interfere with recovery itself in any way.,,
Frustration Features,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Even in these dark times, the world is full of sexy things. Scantily-clad sorceresses, hellishly beautiful demons, and angels possessed of positively divine figures. You'll be distracted constantly, and only through acts of supreme willpower can you focus on the task at hand. This doesn't interfere with attempts at romance (other than not being able to look someone in the eye while talking to them) but it could make things very difficult if you ever get ambushed by a flock of succubi.,,
Communist Hell,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,This is an RPG, so everything you kill has stuff to loot, right? Wrong. Gold and items never spontaneously appears when you kill something.%%%%The only loot you get is what you pry from their hands and fish out of their pockets.,,
Cheap Tileset,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Someone skimped on dungeon design. It seems like you've been through this exact same room and set of furnishings a hundred times. The repetitive environments can make navigation confusing, and long exposure to the monotony will lead to mental exhaustion.,,
Angels and Ministers,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,The Angiris Council rules the High Heavens, setting its laws and guiding the course of the war against hell. You have found yourself bound to their authority, and they will call upon you to perform tasks for them. You cannot refuse, nor can you escape the penance they will lay upon you if you try to twist their commands or act on behalf on Hell.%%%%While demanding, they are not malicious, and though your missions will be difficult, tiring, and unrewarding, they will never knowingly set you on a task beyond your abilities or punish you for unforeseen complications.,,
So Many Shamans,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,The warbands of the weak and cowardly Fallen always have at least one shaman on hand that can resurrect their slain kin. Now every group of demons you encounter has shamans of their own that can raise the slain with only a few moment's of effort.%%%%Slay the shaman first, or mangle the dead beyond any hope of recognition to prevent resurrection, or you'll be facing an endless horde.,,
Trag-Oul's Intervention,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Having long ago withdrawn from mortal affairs to concern himself entirely with maintaining the Balance, Trag-Oul has noticed your arrival.%%%%Your immense power and otherworldly nature was judged a danger to the world, and your warehouse and out-of-jump powers have been sealed away.,,
Prime Target,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The Prime Evils have become aware of you, and deemed you a threat to their plans. They are currently occupied, so the four Lesser Evils, Duriel, Andariel, Azmodan, and Belial have been tasked with your doom. In the beginning, a long parade of cultists and lesser demons will be directed to slay you. As time passes more effort will be spared to destroy you, and you must endure cunning plots, elaborate traps and powerful demonic warriors.%%%%In the final year of your time here, the Four will grow restless with the failure of their servants and seek you out personally. Destroying or imprisoning them only delays their attacks as they will reform and escape to hunt you again.%%%%Within the last few days of the jump they will set aside their pride and attack as one. Though there will be little coordination between them, you must still fight or flee from some of the mightiest creatures of this realm if you wish to survive.,,
Diablo's Keeper,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Had you not intervened, King Leoric's son Aidan would have thrust Diablo's broken soulstone into his own skull after removing it from his brother's corpse in an attempt to keep Diablo contained. Now events conspire that you will be the one who must bear this burden. For ten years, the Lord of Terror will be your constant companion, and he will seek to break you as he has broken countless mortal souls before. You will find little rest and no peace as every being aligned with hell seeks to end your life and free Diablo, or break your will and allow him to claim your body. Even the forces of the High Heavens will attempt to imprison you, unwilling to chance that a Prime Evil is allowed to roam free on Sanctuary.%%%%There is no coming back from surrendering to Diablo's will or being imprisoned by the Archangels, and your chain will end if you suffer either fate.,,
