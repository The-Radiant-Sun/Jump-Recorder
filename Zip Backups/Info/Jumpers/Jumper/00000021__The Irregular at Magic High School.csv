This also applies to other types of magic, allowing you to forgo any kind of somatic spell component.,,
Born Specialized Magician - Series Magician,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,As Magic has certain genetic predispositions, it should be obvious to most that genetic experimentation would be the key to possessing stronger or more diverse Magic.

This power can be self-applied; however it cannot return someone who already died to life.%%%%-Decomposition: This Magic can decompose things, literally deconstructing their inherent structure, capable of vaporizing objects up to the size of a truck almost effortlessly. This can also apply to Magic Sequences, acting as a powerful counter-magic. The user can also dial down the effect to simply dismantle objects like guns into their component pieces.%%%%-Elemental Sight: This Sensory Magic is capable of analyzing the Eidos of practically anything, acting like a view into the Information Dimension. This enables the user to observe things to an absurd level of precision, capable of acting like a bird’s eye view of the area and searching data throughout an entire country at around maximum level. This can also enable the user to instinctively perceive Magic being used like a physical sense.%%%%If taken with Strategic-Class Magician, this perk can be taken again for free to receive another Superpower, and you will gain some very effective training in both. This perk can be taken multiple times for different powers.,,Taken twice with Strategic Class Magician; All chosen
