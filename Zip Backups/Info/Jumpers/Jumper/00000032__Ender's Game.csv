Hegemon - Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You have entered this world uninvited, possessing none of the skills needed to help in the war effort. I guess you’ll make a good politician then.%%%%You begin the jump at age 8+3d8.,,
Polemarch,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are part of the Polemarchy, the military support structure that makes sure the rest of the International Fleet can get the job done. You are skilled in training others.%%%%You begin the jump at age 30+2d8.,,
Shadow,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You were genetically engineered to be the greatest general or agent of all time.%%%%Only time will tell, however, as you begin the jump when you are 5 years old.,,
Strategos,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Through a combination of selective breeding and billions of people to select from, you have been chosen to be one of Earth’s final generals against the Buggers... if you can survive the strain.%%%%You begin the jump at the age of 5+1d4.,,
Net Figure,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are a celebrity on the global net stage, a voice people listen to, seek advice from, and respect... or hate... maybe both. Those below the age of 18 cannot take this without purchasing “Net Invitation”.%%%%In future jumps, you may invoke this perk to become an instant media celebrity... assuming there is any media to be a celebrity of.,,
Intelligence, Civilian Style,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The World of Ender’s Game is a world of brilliant individuals. If you feel you can’t compete, you might consider taking this perk, as it boosts your intelligence into the super genius range.,,
Hacking the Net,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,You possess the ability to hack into almost any computer network without leaving behind evidence that would link you to the crime, including the ability to intuit most non­randomized passwords if you know the individual the password belongs to.,,
National Sponsership,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are officially a member of one of this world’s national military organizations, with a rank commensurate with your skills and abilities. You may call upon the resources of that position, so long as you don’t abuse it.%%%%In future jumps, you may invoke this, either at the beginning of the jump to become active duty, or at any time to return to active duty in your home nation’s military... assuming you weren’t a drop­In.,,
Strategic Genius,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,There is no denying that Ender and his compatriots are brilliant tacticians, but whoever planned the war against the buggers was a strategic genius. You are that kind of thinker, able to chart the course of a 70 year long war across dozens of star systems, without knowing if you’d have a battlefield commander capable of making your dream a reality.%%%%Intricate plans that span decades and rely on imponderables and unpredictable variables are your bread and butter.,,
Polemarch - Military Hierarchy,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,In a world at war, few things are more important than understanding the hows and whys of the military. You gain a familiarity with the International Fleet’s structure, operational basis, symbols, ranks, and procedures. You know how to act, dress, and think military.%%%%The ability updates itself to match the local military (or police force or equivalent) in the starting region of any future jump.,,
Polemarch - Potential Spotting,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Colonel Graff is among the best there is at finding young people with the potential to be commanders. He should be. He’s one of the best at training those people and knows what he’s looking for. Now, so do you.%%%%Any skill you are an expert at teaching (not a skill you are an expert at, but one you are very good at teaching to others) now comes with the ability to recognize the potential for greatness within others, especially in children.,,
Polemarch - Zen Pilot,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are the best of the best when it comes to flying an attack craft, be it airbreathing or spaceborne.%%%%Even at incredible speeds, your aim is true and you never get flustered when under pressure to dodge or die.%%%%You are especially good at spotting command craft in the furball of combat.,,
Polemarch - Command Performance,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You excel at getting those under your command or those you are training to push themselves harder, work longer, and achieve more with less than is at all practical.%%%%Your subordinates will find ways to save time on vital tasks, to stretch a budget or fuel supply that much further, and push themselves to the breaking point for you.%%%%Your methods prompt those to think outside the box, to get unique results, and to break established mental blocks if it means getting the job done.,,
Hegemon - Enlightened Psycopath,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Incompatable with Deep Empathy%%%%A normal psychopath has many dark emotions, compulsions, and desires that make them less than productive members of society.%%%%While you might not be a Psychopath, you have learned to focus some or all of your negative emotions into positive actions.%%%%Hate all humanity, work to make them less hateful. Want to cause pain and suffering, become a dentist. Megalomaniac? Become Hegemon and leave a legacy of unrivalled public service.%%%%Any dark emotion can be refocused, if you can figure out a way to do so.,,
Hegemon - Deep Empathy,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Incompatable with Enlightened Psycopath%%%%You have the ability to form deep emotional bonds with others, allowing you to gain an ever growing sense of how they are feeling, even if they try and hide their emotional state from you, or are unaware of how they are feeling.,,
Hegemon - Demosthenesian Insight,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You posses the strange ability to sense what use other people can be to you or your plans.%%%%The more you know about that individual or group of people, the greater your ability to find a place for them in your plans.,,
Hegemon - Virtual Identity,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You have a way with creating cover identities that can stand up to all but the highest level of scrutiny, of working your way into secure (but not high security) systems and forums, and of getting online jobs you aren't actually qualified for.,,
Hegemon - Locke's Rhetoric,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Your writing skills are now so good you can actually convince people of the correctness of your stance (or at least to take you seriously) on internet forums.%%%%Somehow, you can overcome bias and suppress the more unreasoned vitriolic commentary that are the norm in virtual debate.%%%%Your public speaking skills increase by the same degree.,,
Shadow - Lucky Bean,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You seem to have extraordinary luck in avoiding danger, be it waking up to go to the bathroom right before a bomb explodes under your bed, to ducking to pick up a quarter as an assassin shoots at you, to having the stomach flu the day someone tries to poison your morning coffee.,,
Shadow - Danger Sense,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You gain a 6th sense that warns you when things are becoming dangerous to you. The greater the danger, the stronger the sense.%%%%If the danger is slowly building (a conspiracy to assassinate you), it will begin as a faint tingle of sensation. if the danger is immediate (a car swerving towards you) the sense is more immediate.%%%%This sense does not give you any indicate of where the danger is coming from or what its nature is. This works passively, even when you are unconscious or asleep.,,
Shadow - Quantum Understanding,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You can rapidly come to understand (with no outside instruction) how any system you can study works, no matter how complicated.%%%%A political system, a computer system, an intra­office mailing system... doesn't matter. If you can examine it firsthand, you will rapidly begin to understand the basics and eventually even the subtleties will be revealed to you.%%%%This is merely an understanding of the rules or principles by which such a system functions, allowing you to interfere with or get the best results out of it. It does not grant you any particular skill in utilizing or repairing the system in question.%%%%All it can do is help you to understand what is going on. Knowing how psychic powers work does not grant you psychic powers, ditto magical abilities unless anyone who knows the rules can perform that magic.,,
Shadow - Anton's Key,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Your Intellectual and physical growth never stops. The older biologically you get, the larger you grow, and the larger you grow, the smarter you get. This effect doesn't care about your chronological age, but your biological age, and does not protect you against the square­cube rule, so it is possible to become so large you cannot move. Reaching that size will probably take about two decades for someone with relatively normal human biology, though, depending on how strong your bones and muscles are, it might take much, much longer.,,
Strategos - Killed Him with a Shoe,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You can make anything into a deadly weapon and instinctively know how to get the best performance out of things that actually are deadly weapons.,,
Strategos - Move Me,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have an instinctive understanding of the motivations of other people, a form of empathy that allows you to understand why they do what they do, and (potentially) to anticipate their actions as you get to know them better.,,
Strategos - Supreme Commander,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Not only are you a brilliant tactician, but you have an instinctive grasp of how battlefields shift, flow, evolve, granting you an ability to predict enemy maneuvers that borders on precognition.,,
Strategos - When You Love a Thing,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You can destroy that thing. You possess the ability to find the weakness in any defense. Unfortunately, this requires understanding the nature of that which you would destroy on a deeply emotional and spiritual level.,,
Money,,2,,-500,,True,,False,,Free for Polemarch%%%%You get a bunch of money, probably enough to live on for a few months.,,
The Mind Game,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,You gain a tablet upon which is installed a copy of the Mind Game. It will learn from you and your surroundings, always presenting you with new challenges.,,
Little Doctor Technology,,2,,-10000,,True,,True,,A terrifying device that can be mounted on a spaceship and which will disintegrate... any unshielded solid object it hits. Including a planet. The result is... not pleasant.%%%%You will find this device delivered to your warehouse, along with its schematics, at the end of your stay here.,,
Hegemon - Net Invitation,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have access to the public debate forums of the Net, which are by invitation only. If you are a minor, you must have this to access the Net at all.%%%%After the jump, you can use this invitation to take part in any public debate as if you were an invited speaker.,,
Hegemon - Ansible Technology,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,You gain a collection of 100 Ansible philote gems and the technology to create an Ansible network from them.%%%%Every jump you will gain 100 more philotes.,,
Polemarch - Bean's Stolen Children,,2,,-2000,,False,,False,,Somehow, you have come into possession of the 8 fetuses that were stolen from Petra and Bean. Or rather, they will appear in your warehouse a week before the end of this jump.,,
Polemarch - Your own Private Battle Room,,2,,-5000,,True,,True,,Your warehouse gains (as an annex) a copy of the Battle Room, complete with asteroid generation systems, two gates, and 42 standard Flash Suits and Guns (these guns do not have the same property as the one that comes with the personal suit). The Battle Room has gravity generators, of course.%%%%For 100 CP more, the room comes with combat robots to serve as opponents.,,Purchased at second level
Strategos - Battle School Invitation,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,50 CP for Shadow%%%%You have received an invitation from Colonel Graff to attend Battle School. If you want to go to the Battle School (as other than an observer) you will need this.%%%%In future jumps, this will count as an admission letter to any top level military academy, like West Point or Annapolis.,,
Strategos - Command School Invitation,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,If you want to guarantee your place in Command School (no observers, the base is Top Secret), you will need an invitation.%%%%Of course, this will mean you've completed Battle School already, so your age is bumped up 2 years.%%%%In future jumps, this will count as an admission letter to Officer Candidate school if you are enlisted or a letter of promotion to the lowest command rank if you begin a jump as an officer, or the next higher rank if you are already command rank.,,
Strategos - Flash Suit with Gun,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Free for Shadow%%%%You gain a personal Flash Suit & Side Arm.%%%%Outside of this jump, the side arm can be used to make any piece of clothing stiffen into immobility until either flashed again or about half an hour has passed.%%%%The Flash Suit is an impact resistant armored space suit.,,
Jeesh,,3,,00,,False,,False,,You can import some of your Companions to serve as your Jeesh, your army, your sub­commanders. You can import up to 3 for 100, up to 7 for 200, or up to 11 for 300. Each of them gains 600 CP to spend on perks and must be either Strategos or Shadow.,,
Shadow - Rival,,3,,-1000,,False,,False,,One of your companions gains every Perk you gain from this jump, but (for the duration of the jump), they are dead set on proving they’re better than you.,,
Polemarch - Bookend Siblings,,3,,-2000,,False,,False,,Two of your companions are imported as your siblings. They must be companions who don’t normally get along, or they gain personality traits that put them at odds with one another. They cannot be of your background, but they gain their choice of background and 800 CP to spend on perks.,,
Hegemon - Hive Queen Cocoon,,3,,-8000,,False,,True,,You gain an infant Formic Queen as a companion at the end of the jump. She can build biological sub­light ships, spawn millions of drones, and is telepathic across galactic distances. Her spawn are not sentient, merely an extension of herself.%%%%However, she is a pacifist and will not kill other sapient beings. She takes several decades to reach maturity, and building vast infrastructure will take a very long time. She is essentially immobile and must be protected, usually by her spawn.,,
Third,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are a third child, something of a social outcast, a mark of parents who flaunted the law, and a drain on necessary resources.,,
Feared,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You have a reputation for being vicious, for doing anything needed to crush those who get in your way and for going out of your way to cause others pain.,,
Planet Time,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Only time spent on a planet counts for your 10 years here. If you’d like the jump to last longer, you will find getting off planet difficult. If you’d like the jump to be shorter, you’ll find getting planetside difficult.%%%%Be honest, don’t game this one.,,
Dark Empathy,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You cannot help but empathize with everyone around you, especially those you have strong feelings about, such as enemies.,,
Monitered,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You have a Monitor Implant that transmits your surface thoughts, emotions, and actions back to the higher authorities. It cannot be disabled or removed without making you a vegetable.,,
The Hatred of the Hive,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You are terrified of the Buggers, paranoid they’re personally out to get you and have agents among the human population, and convinced that their queens are taking to you inside your own head.,,
Queen of Nightmares,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The hive queens are trying to understand you like they are Ender and are probing your mind from light years distant. You are unaware of this probing, but it manifests as horrific visions and nightmares that come at you at unpredictable intervals, but at least a few times each week.%%%%Restful sleep will rapidly become a memory... and these nightmares will only grow more horrific and common if the Buggers are destroyed.,,
Humanity is a Scourge,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,The Bugger Queens, normally pacific creatures who were appalled to find they'd killed other sapients, have sensed your coming.%%%%Instead of waiting to be destroyed by Ender, they've decided that humanity must be destroyed and will use every trick at their disposal, including turning every computer on Earth against you and jamming the Ansible needed to communicate with the Fleets sent against them.,,
Real Madrid,,4,,8000,,False,,False,,Bonzo Madrid is now just as badass as he thinks he is. He gains all the perks offered in this jump, and a random assortment of your perks as well, and hates you for some slight, real or imagined.%%%%He will constantly try and screw with your plans, and may (if he can find a time when he believes you are vulnerable) try and kill you or your companions.,,
