Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,5,,-1000,,True,,True,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Spirit of a Nation,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are an incorporeal force that watches over your burgeoning colony but should you prefer you can directly control the actions of your colony’s leaders, from whomever is in charge of everything to the captain of a single ship. When you directly take control of a leader you may leave them at any time with no repercussions and everybody will recognize you as being the Spirit of the Nation, only people who are in an official position of power as well as being loyal to you are available to take control of. If the person you are controlling dies however, you will be rendered unconscious for a few years, the only way to truly kill you is to completely destroy or subjugate the society you have built, having another sponsor achieve one of the victory conditions listed below also causes a similar failure.,,
Surprisingly Long Lived,,0,,00,,True,,True,,The systems on the Seedship which caused its leader to stop aging, with no side effects and no stigma or favor from any of the other humans on any of the ships. You are not invulnerable though, as aging is the only problem you don’t need to worry about so expect the usual; armies, “accidents”, and aliens to be just as bad as normal. As an upside though you get to keep being… whatever you are at this point, or just human.,,
I Keep Saying “Human”,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,So some jumpers just don't like humanity, or have their own race which comes with less historical baggage, regardless you can pay 100cp to swap your colonists to another race, any inherent abilities will remain the same and they will be able to live in the same environments as humans if they couldn't before, any usage of “Human” in this jump is interchangeable with your chosen race. Also the other sponsors will consider your people as human unless you wish otherwise. If you take the Haven’t I done this before? drawback you may import a race for free%%,,
Outside Bet - Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Well this is awkward, the Seeding never chose you to be in charge. As some time between leaving Earth and planetfall, you ended up replacing your predecessor, the records are fuzzy on what happened but you have access to the archives as well as editing privileges. I’m not telling you to make something up, but it would make the others less confused when you turn up instead of whomever was supposed to.,,
Seated Power,,0,,00,,True,,False,,If a nation is moving on shouldn't its leader go with them? After all, as a member of your government's upper echelon, you are the greatest representative of your people as a whole, nevermind the fact that yours is probably a country cobbled together after the Great Mistake. Semantics aside, you are experienced and well connected in politics, so you should know who to keep close, or closer.,,
Canary in the Mine,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Let's be honest here, your country doesn't expect the Seeding to work. You are on the equivalent of a shoestring budget, for a space colonization program that is, the worst part about this is that everyone knows about it. Expect higher highs when your people want to spite whomever sent you here, and lower lows since you kinda are supposed to die along with anybody that they wanted to get rid of such as political opposition, officials who thought too much of themselves, or even just people to be made examples of. The other major factions at least will feel more pity for you than anything, especially if you distance yourself from that oh so terrible government on Earth who clearly has no regard for their own. Double or nothing jumper, or is it double and nothing?,,
Exemplar,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Why did we send a celebrity to an unknown frontier again? To be fair you aren't just an actor or musician, more of a populist or other thorn in the side of your political opponents which just happened to be competent enough to send to space, you don't need to deal with them, and they don't need to deal with you, everybody wins. Because of this you are not receiving as much as if the nation itself decided to relocate entirely, probably since they still have some interests back on Earth, but you are not being neglected, you are just being kitted out to make sure you stay on the new planet instead of bothering the higher ups.,,
Preperations,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Before your journey there were preparations to be made, who and what to bring along, any extra modules on your spacecraft, and of course what planet the Seeding aimed for.%%%%Each origin gets to have four of their preparations free and Drop-ins may choose one free for each category. ,,
Preperations - Colonists,,0,,-5000,,True,,False,,Who did you decide to prioritize when leaving Earth? Each one you take becomes about 1/10 of your population, with 50 CP per choice.%%%%Aristocrats (Seated Power)%%- The nobility of the old world is not one primarily determined by blood but one chosen by riches, these tycoons and titans of industry have bought their place aboard your seedship and can help you income of the newly created energy credits or any other currency for that matter. It's just business, no point arguing about it.%%%%Artists (Seated Power)%%- They might not make things the cheapest or most efficiently but they will be a beacon of humanity’s creativity and legacy even in this far off planet. The works of your people are enough to make your fellow colonial sponsors think twice before acting against you due to their value. As in the end, what are we without our culture?%%%%Refugees (Canary in the Mine)%%- The colonists are those well adjusted to the life after the Great Mistake, they can survive on less resources and are more accepting of its rationing. Since after all, we can’t all eat like kings.%%%%Pioneers (Canary in the Mine)%%- Exploring an alien planet almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter huh? Well these explorers and settlers are better at dealing with it than anyone else and they will more readily make new settlements and venture out to explore the world and already have some training in such professions.%%%%Engineers (Exemplar)%%- Crewing the ship may very well be the same people who designed and built it, they are specialized in efficient design and usage of materials to their fullest to make nearly anything faster and better than those without such knowledge.%%%%Scientists (Exemplar)%%- Your people are more effective researchers, able to better work with data and synthesize new technology faster and better adapt the new resources on the planet. For Science!%%%%Mercenaries (1 Free Exemplar)%%- When leaving Earth you decided to hire these soldiers of fortune in case of “conflicts” with your fellow sponsors or if the planet is already inhabited by similarly uncooperative forces. They do have an end to their initial contract however, a nebulous “until the colony is on its feet” but they will never turn on you and will still defend themselves if stationed in a city under attack.,,20% Pioneers - 100 CP%%40% Engineers - 200 CP%%40% Scientists - 200 CP
Preperations - Cargo,,0,,-2000,,True,,False,,You had enough room in your seedship to carry along some things to help you get started on a new world; 50 CP per choice.%%%%Weapon Arsenal (Seated Power)%%- A pile of guns! These weapons can arm an infantry company big enough to thoroughly cover an area the size of your initial settlement, the extra soldiers can also lay down their arms and work civilian jobs, but why bother with turning swords to plowshares when you can just take someone else’s?%%%%Cryotome (Seated Power)%%- A fancy way of saying a bunch of servers containing the greatest works of Earth, millenia of literature, art, and music are at the fingertips of your people and similar to the artists the storage of this makes you more important in the eyes of the other sponsors and therefore having them be more receptive to your requests.%%%%Machinery (Canary in the Mine)%%- A few units of large industrial vehicles, with treads and two clamps for arms that can be switched out for welding tools or given a buoyant base should they need to build something on the high seas. The machines are near useless in combat however as they are slow enough that a regular human can match their speed on flat land and the windshields are not bulletproof or alien-proof for that matter.%%%%Raw Materials (Canary in the Mine)%%- A few large containers of various metals, polymers, and electronics that should be enough to set up basic medical facilities or to be stored away for later, though the resources on the planet will eventually overtake those you have brought from home.%%%%Hydroponics (Canary in the Mine)%%- Using hydroponic technology your ship was able to either sustain a higher population or have a greater supply of food after planetfall. Regardless of how, your colony begins with around double the population of the other colonies.%%%%Laboratory (Exemplar)%%- A state of the art facility designed for environmental research, it should be enough to analyze the planet to the degree which would let you make long distance caravans or modules for setting up new cities shortly after planetfall.%%%%Xeno Management (Exemplar)%%- So the R&D division went ahead and used the various materials in cargo to make this after you landed, using ultrasonic frequencies it can harm the aliens by using their superior perception of sound and light against them, effectively acting like a constant flashbang against them.,,Weapon Arsenal - Free, Machinery, Raw Materials, Hydroponics, Laboratory
Preperations - Spacecraft,,0,,-2000,,True,,False,,Each Seedship was custom made to the specifications of the sponsor nations and each had something to make sure of the success of the colonization efforts. 50 CP per choice.%%%%Supply Module (Seated Power)%%- Before planetfall the governments of Earth sent resource pods containing well… resources to the planet, these pods mostly store colony building supplies such as disassembled solar collecting satellites, raw materials, food, or cultural relics from Earth. With a dedicated supply module your colony has been able to send its own pods shortly after launch and thus can guarantee at least two of them are going to land near your colony.%%%%Fusion Reactor (Seated Power)%%- A ship of the future needs a power source of the future right? Well yours is fitted with an experimental fusion reactor which can sustain itself near infinitely off of your current supplies but the experimental part is the important one as it doesn't have the output to keep up with the needs of the colony after a few decades of growth.%%%%Lifeform Sensor (Seated Power)%%- Just in case the planet was inhabited your ship was given an orbital scanner for large concentrations of mobile, biological life and lately you have seen signs of them clustering around what seem to be nests? The sensor can detect both these nests as well as groups of aliens or large individual aliens, but it does not tell you anything about their surroundings.%%%%Retrograde Thrusters (Canary in the Mine)%%- By sticking some extra thrusters on our landing craft we can make some minor adjustments to our course before hitting the ground and by that we can have a greater range of land when deciding where to make planetfall.%%%%Electromagnetic Sensor (Canary in the Mine)%%- There were others involved in the Seeding, small companies, micronations, and other influential organizations. However not all of them made it as far as the others, their abandoned wreckage on the other hand might contain artefacts from earth or findings here such as from the mysterious progenitors, this sensor will help us find both of these as well as mark some alien nests containing similarly fascinating artefacts.%%%%Tectonic Scanner (Exemplar)%%- The Great Mistake was in part caused by competition over resources and that will inevitably follow us here as well, so we need to get control of those resources first. This will help us with that by showing all sources of titanium, petroleum, and geothermal energy from afar, so we don't need to send prospectors after them.%%%%Continental Surveyor (Exemplar)%%- While we can see it pretty well from space, we won't have enough time to make a full map of the planet so we have this to scan coastlines and from them create a close facsimile of a map, though we cannot get a good look at whatever is further inland.%%,,Fusion Reactor - Free, Lifeform Sensor - Free, Retrograde Thrusters, Electromagnetic Sensor, Tectonic Scanner, Continental Surveyor
Planet - Eta Vulpeculae B,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,What this was all leading up to, where did the Seeding project decide to land? Pick one or roll 1d10 for a 100cp bonus.%%%%Equatorial%%- This planet has a fast rotational period, meaning that the days are short and the equator is covered in mountainous terrain.%%%%Glacial%%- A frozen world, when we first looked at it the planet seemed to have a climate similar to Earth, but since then there seems to have been an ice age, at least you don’t need to worry about water supplies.%%%%Inland Sea%%- You know what Pangea is right? Well this is the exact opposite, there is one large body of water on the planet and it is completely surrounded by inhabitable land.%%%%Kepler 186f	%%- One of the oldest known Earth-like planets, a faint image of the seas and continents of this world inspired the Seeding.%%%%Rigil Khantoris Bb	%%- An arid world orbiting the closest star to our solar system, increasing the likelihood for factions nostalgic for Earth to arise.%%%%Tau Ceti d	%%- This planet of seas and archipelagos features a booming biodiversity and a wealth of resources.%%%%Mu Arae f	%%- Tidally locked in orbit around a weak star, the southern hemisphere of this planet is a blistering desert where the sun never sets, while the northern hemisphere is perpetually in frozen darkness.%%%%82 Eridani e		%%- A world wracked by tectonic forces and without oceans or easily accessible water.%%%%Eta Vulpeculae b	%%- A massive continent holds a deep wilderness in its interior, rich with resources and thickly populated with indegenous life.%%%%Free Choice. You managed to sway or strongarm the others in the project to listen to you when choosing the planet to land on, pick any of the above.%%,,
Affinity,,0,,-10000,,True,,True,,Affinities can be likened to the ideologies of old Earth, now they are more simple however, as they have limited overlap and there are only three of them. In later jumps an affinity can be applied to any society you lead and they will follow its general principles universally, willingly, and with your interpretation.%%%%You may pick one for Free, pay 600cp if you want two or 1000cp for all three.%%%%%%Harmony:%%“We destroyed one planet when we moved against its rhythms, and brought ourselves to the brink of extinction. What great things will we accomplish as we dance with this world?”%%%%In order for humanity to survive, we must adapt to our environment rather than egotistically believe ourselves to be greater than a planet, so what if we rather than repeat the mistakes of the past, change so we are no longer able to do so. Harmonists use bioengineering to both use domesticated aliens and custom designed lifeforms to create a distinct culture, plentiful food, and excellent medicine. The Miasma pervading the world is also something the Harmonists will adapt to, not only becoming immune but becoming stronger and healing when exposed to it, just because they make use of the planet’s natural life does not mean that they must endear themselves to the aliens however, as a Harmonist can make just as many dead bugs as a trigger-happy Purist. Your main resource to consider is Xenomass, a green biological goop that works as anything from fuel to controllable stem cells, though wherever there is Xenomass, Miasma and alien nests are sure to be close.%%%%%%Purity:%%“All humans are one family. Those who are not of our family are not human. Amen, amen, we say to you: Let them not test our forbearance.”%%%%We came here with a mission, to save humanity and survive past the great mistake. With us we bring our only definite proof of intelligent life, our culture, faith, and history, this does not mean that we are only artists and writers hoping the dangers of the world will pass us by. No when the demons of this world are at our gates we will beat our plowshares into swords and strike back just as we have since the Stone Age. And just like our forebears we will transform this world to our design, not just canals and tunnels, but Terrascapes, massive swathes of land remade in the image of Earth, a veritable new Eden at our fingertips. Purists are not completely averse to new technology or new resources though, as the material known as Floatstone is a necessity in their LEV technology but unlike the other affinities they can make do without it as titanium resources are enough to produce advanced equipment cheaper and faster than others. Also instead of focusing on new types of land developments they prefer to enhance their farms and generators, if it works why bother replacing it? Purity has a greater emphasis on ranged force than others, with massive LEV Destroyers and Tanks being able to fire from safe positions behind a front line of Aegis mechs and Battlesuits.%%%%%%Supremacy:%%“Truth is binary. There is one, positive, yes, light, the machine, progress, upgrade, holism, independence, eternity. And there is the opposite of these, which is anathema.”%%%%Machinery is what propelled humanity from simply surviving through their environment to being above it, and so it shall be once more in this world. This environment is more hostile than that of Earth however, so we must develop superior machines and technology to compensate and perhaps take the technology into ourselves by replacing limbs and organs, possibly even uploading our minds into superior bodies entirely. To develop these marvels we need industrial might, and research to discover how we do so, the Firaxite (yes it's actually called that) found on this world can function as a vital part to advanced computers and even artificial intelligence. With recent developments in robotics they are becoming closer to humans in behavior and on the other side of the coin, augmentation is leading to humans being closer to machines physically, how long will it be until we are indistinguishable? Supremacists emphasize heavy industry as well as sheer quantity of research through computing technology, they also specialize in better satellite infrastructure compared to the other affinities.%%%%%%Neutral:%%“It has been said that time is the great equalizer. And yet, here we stand, triumphant in our perseverance. The world has known peace and war. It has borne weakness to the rise and fall of colonies, both great and small. And it has succumbed to the ravages of time, as do all things. All things, except for us.”%%%%Really? You think what you already have is good enough to take you to the end? Or are you just not won over by the radical (anti)transhumanists? Well if you say so, no affinity will be applied to your people, what this means is up to you, if you have your own idea that doesn't overlap with the others or if you want to stay with the ideas that you left Earth with. Being on the exact boundary of all the affinities also would count as being none of them as well. Remember that the others will not necessarily hate you, but they will think less of you for either being willing to deal with their enemies or not taking their side, so try not to accidentally cause a world war?,,
New Discoveries,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You and your people are better at investigating archaeological sites, being able to find key artefacts and hidden mechanisms more easily. You will also be able to comb through an excavation site around twice as fast and with half of the resources used.,,
Gone Fishing,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Building and maintaining ships and aquatic cities comes more easily to you, with everything running more smoothly when on the water as well as being able to move through deep or stormy water without suffering any ill effects or without needing specialized technology to do so. In addition you and your Civilization will be able to breathe underwater and greatly enhanced mental and physical capabilities when at sea.,,
Resourceful,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are just that much better at plundering the land for all its bounty, to the point where whenever you find raw materials in nature you can make them last 50% longer and they will always be of at least above average quality.,,
Natural Marvels,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Just like Earth, this planet has amazing places that are completely natural, wondrous even. Most people would just see them as a pretty sight, or something in the way, but you know better since every time you find one of these is the beginning of a journey. “For what?” You may ask, well these are all connected to the existence or purpose of the marvel and are unique based on what you found, and whenever you finish the task you get another ability based on the landmark itself, for example an abandoned city would make you more powerful when in urban environments or a giant skeleton could make the species similar to that of the skeleton look more favorably on you. There will only be one marvel quest per jump.,,
Outside Bet - Standardized Planning,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,I get that it makes them less special, and kind of depressing to be honest, but stamping down city blocks is just easier on the workers and means that homelessness is less of a problem. Good thing that making standardized designs comes naturally to you, with a little more time spent it’s also easy to make them modular or able to fit together neatly.,,
Outside Bet - Entrepreneurial Markets,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,While you might not have started out in your mother’s garage, you are an expert in not only tapping into unexplored markets, but also in creating entirely new industries and then holding a near monopoly on them which go unnoticed by anybody who’s supposed to take that from you.,,
Outside Bet - Social Liquidity,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Typically the private sector doesn’t like investing in social programs, but after the Great Mistake, the difference between country and corporation became increasingly blurred, especially in Polystralia and North America. So with these new megacorporations came the unthinkable, companies paying for public programs like pensions and schools, and they even cut corners less than most of the time. Unfortunately you can’t harness the power of Ayn Rand spinning in her grave but you can settle for the next best thing. You  know which industries would turn a profit from your investments and also where best to use your liquid assets for the most effect, whether that be a social program for PR or long term investment, or acquiring a small business with a new idea.,,
Seated Power - Field Apprenticeship,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The best way to learn is by doing! Especially when it’s for something on say, an alien planet with definite signs of life? Well regardless you not only learn better when doing the thing you want to learn or by being in the place where it’s done, but also teach it better too.,,
Seated Power - Networked Values,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,A strange thing about nearly every culture or belief system is that they are paradoxical in some way, probably since it’s nearly impossible to account for each and every issue consistently. Unless the system has you at its head, then it somehow makes sense when faced with even the worst of dilemmas.,,
Seated Power - Technoartisnal Methods,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Thanks to the Enlightenment and Romantic schools of thought, art and science are often seen as at odds with each other, now we are free of those delusions you can properly apply them both to their fullest. From paintings designed with psychological intent and influence, to AI writing literature better than humans, the possibilities are as endless as the fields themselves.,,
Canary in the Mine - Frugal Homesteading,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You and your people have had it rough, it’s not just now though but some good has come out of it, namely that you know how much of something you need to survive. This also led to getting used to living off of the bare minimum, you also won’t be having any kind of problems adjusting your body for when you do have extra supplies to spare, also rationing of basically any resource comes naturally when times are tough.,,
Canary in the Mine - Settler Spirit,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Get out there, Jumper, there’s a whole new world out there ripe for the taking! Your nation is already eager to explore and start a new life on this blank slate, so why shouldn’t you be the same? Remember why we’re here in the first place, Earth has nothing more for us, not only in its petty bickering between nations but also it ran out of new places, we’ve seen every desert, climbed every mountain, trekked to both poles, and even mapped the ocean depths, now we have the opportunity to do that all again.,,
Canary in the Mine - Eudaimonic Ecology,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Farming is probably the most important invention in human history, thanks to it we were able to build cities visible from space, skyrocket the population into the billions, and its diminishing was the first symptom of the Great Mistake. You know of agriculture’s value jumper, you and your people are experts in it to a degree that any harvests or livestock cultivated are not only free of disease and parasites, but also give multiple times the amount of nutrients and substance, to the point where a single medium sized fruit(around the size of an apple) can be selectively bred and fertilized into the equivalent of a full meal. Note that this is not only for plants, if you grow fungi or raise animals then this applies to them as well.,,
Exemplar - Survival Tactics,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Sometimes you just need to fight for your life… and that doesn’t always involve literal fighting, whenever you need to forage for supplies or find your way around an unknown wilderness, you’re better at doing any of it. This is to the extent that as long as you are outdoors, you basically have a natural compass, clock, and can make intuitively accurate maps of areas up to 1.5 sq km.,,
Exemplar - Adaptive Corps,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,“It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.” And you are nothing if not a survivor, and this makes sure you will be leading them as well, making you and any military force under your command better able to recognize enemy tactics well as flaws in their own. Also your forces can better learn to use equipment they are untrained in or jury-rigged themselves.,,
Exemplar - Brutal Operations,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,If you give your enemy an inch they’ll take a mile, so the best thing to do is to make sure they won’t be getting any opportunities. The way you do this might be considered “brutal” by some but they just don’t understand what needs to be done. With this you are able to extract resources more efficiently, cut down on maintenance costs, your troops will fight harder, and you can also “borrow” the orbital infrastructure of stations trading with you. Remember, it's not a human rights violation if you redefine “human”.,,
Neutral - An Open Book,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Is what you can see in others, with just a few minutes of conversation you’ll glean four things about them:%%- A single phrase in their native language which sums up what they believe in and their modus operandi.%%- A word that describes how they act towards their allies.%%- A word that describes how they sway people to their side.%%- A word that describes how they act in combat.%%%%All of these are generalizations without context however so don’t be surprised when somebody described as “greedy” decides to give something away for no apparent gain.%%,,
Neutral - Black Market Membership,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Such a crass term isn’t it? What the control freaks over there brand a black market, we prefer to call… free trade, yes the prices might be high for some, but the tags are not set in stone and you know that well. In any trade deemed illegal by an influential authority will find you a trustworthy buyer or seller, and when buying you can haggle a discount easily. Also whenever you need to look for somebody willing to sell, you end up with an opportunity to find them quickly after setting out and you don’t even need to worry about being followed.,,
Neutral - Shake Both Hands,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Being stabbed in the back hurts, and the more paranoid types are always looking backwards. The thing is, you don’t need to actually stab them, just promise you are whenever somebody accuses you of working with the enemy. So with this you can be everyone’s friend! And when you do end up choosing a side then nobody else would think that the “double agent” would turn on them again, what a ridiculous idea, you are clearly working in their best interests, right?,,
Neutral - For Your Eyes Only,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,The Culper Cell says hello, jumper. With this perk in every jump you will have a clandestine organization loyal to you and willing to follow your orders, their size and power scales with the social standing of your chosen origin, with Drop-ins being equivalent to the lowest available option but they are housed within a temporary warehouse attachment for that jump. Here they will have minor cells within the other colonies regardless of which origin you picked.,,
Harmony - Alien Wranglin’,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,If you are able to non-lethally restrain a wild animal or tame it the normal way it will quickly become loyal to you as if it was raised from birth, or equivalent, this perk only applies to non-domesticated animals which are not already raised in captivity. The leashing process also creates a link between you that lets you issue mental commands and can have the animal tell you things to the extent they understand it.,,
Harmony / Purity - Gene Smelter,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are an expert in the art of Genetic Engineering, enhancing physical and mental capabilities as well as being able to eliminate genetic diseases before they cause any damage or alter plants to be better suited to your purposes. And the potential for rejection of a modification is greatly reduced, as well as making cloning technology work much more efficiently. Your knowledge will apply to any new species you discover in other jumps as well as retroactively to anything you already have samples of.,,
Harmony / Supremacy - In with the New,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,They say that art imitates life, so let’s make that more literal shall we? With this perk any machinery or other technology will be able to replicate any capabilities seen biologically. Also any program you make will grow similar to evolution, with AI forks and copies being better adapted to whatever their intended purpose is.,,
Harmony - Miasmic Condensation,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You’ve developed a unique connection to the miasma endemic to the planet, not just simple immunity but healing and being physically better when within a cloud of the stuff. The regeneration is powerful to the degree of regrowing limbs and organs (not the brain however). In terms of combat you will be able to see clearly within miasma and detect anything moving within. You can also create 200 meters cubed worth of it at will, which only dissipates when you want it to or when you try to make more than the stated amount.,,
Purity - This is not Exile,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You might have left Earth behind, but you have not forgotten it, especially now as with this perk you will always be able to remember a greater purpose or mission across long periods of time such as, say, being sent to colonize an alien planet for the survival of humanity?,,
Purity / Harmony - Ascendancy,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,In terms of your species, you are perfect, there are absolutely no flaws in your genetics in terms of diseases or anything you would not want. In addition any clones of you or your children will share this perk, which will also update whenever you undergo any type of genetic modification.,,
Purity / Supremacy - Mastery,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Since the beginning of humanity we have used tools to our advantage, those thinking that the tools deserve to be considered on the level of us, to be placed as equals among our family across Earth and this planet is simply delusional. You, on the other hand, are able to command machinery to an extent fitting humanity. Making it move with but a thought, however more complex machines such as computers are harder to control and any true artificial intelligence will completely ignore your will.,,
Purity - LEV-itation,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Ah Floatstone, the material that allows all of our anti-gravity tech to function properly. Good thing you managed to replicate its qualities on a personal scale, with equipment that lets you manipulate local gravity within line of sight in any direction as well as changing its force up to 20 times stronger or weaker. It doesn't even need to be external equipment either, you just seem to do it anyway, and well enough to finely manipulate objects down to the nanometer.,,
Supremacy - Satellite Uplink,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Launching Satellites is easy! Especially with this perk letting you know exactly how to put one into orbit and onto the precise path you want it on. Having the infrastructure to do so is another matter though, good thing you have an intuitive sense for where best to put a launch site and when conditions are ideal.,,
Supremacy / Harmony - Flesh and Steel,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Biological and mechanical technology are often placed in opposition to each other, but should that really be the case? You have seen past this false dichotomy and are able to combine biological and mechanical technology seamlessly, with no risk of rejection or incompatibility from either method. Not only this but you can also make designed lifeforms that can be digitally controlled via embedded computers or vice versa. Let your creations take you to victory.,,
Supremacy / Purity - Might Makes Rich,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,War, what’s it good for? Well your factories for one, since they experience around a 10 times increase in productivity whenever you are engaged in a military conflict with another nation. For some reason your people also never seem to get tired of the constant drain on their able bodied children being sent to die on the other side of the world, or for your greedy optimization to fuel some grand design they probably don’t care about, you monster.,,
Supremacy - Prime Operator,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Across the multiverse all synthetic minds bow to you, from Turing’s codebreaker to quantum computers, anything that can be considered a computer will allow you free access to all of its capabilities or information stored within. Any sapient AI or one with a distinct personality will be made aware of your effect on them unless you specifically try to make it more subtle and thus slightly less effective.%%%%If you also have Mastery you can take control of all machines physically as well as the internal systems thereof, and only the most advanced of AI, like a Matryoshka Brain, will notice your intrusion, the others believing their own actions are to blame.,,
Wonders,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Just like back on Earth, for you wonders have two forms, a large “true” form which provides benefits to your whole nation or an area around it, and a smaller version that gives personal effects. Wonders can be swapped between the two forms by placing the small version on the ground, or trying to pick up the large version. Nobody will consider this unusual and will believe that the large version was always there or the same for the empty lot you left after picking one up, though they will recognize it as being yours. Wonders reform in your warehouse at the beginning of a jump if destroyed.,,
Outside Bet - Dimension Folding Complex,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,"All conflict stems from scarcity. Not enough resources? Find more. Not enough personnel? Train more. Not enough time or space? Create more."	 - Vadim Kozlov, New Discourses on Consolidated Colonial Establishments%%%%It was pretty crammed in the Seedships so it was nice that you found this after you landed. The DFC is a large building that somehow manages to be about 10 times as large of a volume when within compared to outside.%%%%In the smaller form it functions as a backpack, crate, or your choice of storage, regardless of what it looks like the DFC will be able to either send items directly to your warehouse or simply store items with the same ratio as above. If there is anything in the DFC when you switch its form the contents will be placed in stasis until it is changed to its previous form.,,
Outside Bet - Archimedes Lever,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,"Do not assume the battleground is impartial or in your favor." - Rejinaldo Leonardo Pedro Bolivar de Alencar-Araripe, Principles of Modern Wa%%%%Before advances in geology, earthquakes have long been seen as the wrath of some angered deity or other supernatural phenomenon. Well I'm not sure if you are one of those but the Archimedes Lever is a massive tower like structure which sends precision shockwaves through the ground to cause up to 9.0 Richter scale earthquakes anywhere on the same tectonic plate.%%%%In its smaller form it becomes a futuristic staff with the ability to cause 5.0 Richter quakes anywhere within sight as well as break up the ground into finer materials, stones into gravel or sand for example.,,
Seated Power - Quantum Politics,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,"Are we such poor, simple creatures? Give it a large enough glossary and even a rude gridtap can move us around like so many chessmen." - Lena Ebner, A People's Confession of Earth.%%%%Ah politics, the scourge of efficiency and potential cause of the Great Mistake. Good thing that this computer is better at it than any normal human could ever hope to be, as within its rows of quantum processors it can calculate the outcomes of any sociopolitical scenario given to it all neatly compiled for you to choose a path to take.%%%%When shrunk it is a program that is installed on any electronic device of your choice, the problem is that without as many resources as before, it will only be able to account for factors within your current jump, not your warehouse or outside perks and items, also it takes much longer, around as fast as the bureaucracy of a small country in the early 21st century coincidentally.,,
Seated Power - Ansible,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,"When will the orders arrive? Now? Can they be sent faster?" - Vadim Kozlov, Axioms from the Minutes of the Central Directorate .%%%%Get to the point already! Using the power of quantum technobabble this comms array can make messages sent nearby (100m radius around it) travel at near instant speed, when distances are long enough for lightspeed to feel slow then whatever you sent will actually arrive before you send it, just in case you feel like applying more realistic physics to interstellar communications.%%%%In its smaller form it becomes integrated into whatever method of long distance communication you are using, making it able to connect to any other method of communication with no issues as well as send signals at faster than light. When used at a scale such that light would take over an hour to travel, it also becomes untraceable when you want it to be.,,
Canary in the Mine - Relativistic Data Bank,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,"Operations begin with intelligence. Ideal intel gathers itself, in abundance, before you even conceive of the use for it." - Suzanne Marjorie Fielding, New Approaches to Perpendicular Colonial Relations %%%%Security is important, especially for your data. Now this might sound like an advertisement for a VPN, what’s on offer here is much better than one of those things. With the RDB, any information stored within is encrypted with a cipher that is absolutely unbreakable; the only way to get into it is to have explicit permission from you that you gave of your own volition. It can also act as a prison of sorts for any AI that you want to keep from causing any trouble.%%%%Sometimes you don’t need massive servers worth of secrets and contained AIs, so you can switch it into a program that applies its signature ciphers to anything you attach it to, but not as advanced as its larger counterpart so they can be broken into, but it would take centuries for the most advanced early 21st century computer to do so.,,
Canary in the Mine - Tectonic Anvil,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,"I am told that the planet's core is hot, dense, and explosive, and I am reminded of our Parliament." - Élodie, Remarques%%%%Since before recorded history, metal has been key to the development of humanity, so getting more of it is only a good thing right? Well the Tectonic Anvil is a massive mining rig that is capable of both extracting and then processing any inorganic material that you dig out of the ground. Activate it above the ground and watch as it sends out a workforce, anything from nanites to microbes to local civilian miners, to dig up materials of choice and if needed process them into a version ready for industrial usage. The mining will always be the same speed, very fast - fanwank responsibly, and never cause any accidents or cave-ins, even if you use human miners they just so happen to be really good at making tunnel reinforcements.%%%%If you keep it miniaturized then it acts as a literal anvil that generates an amount of metal of your choice that is naturally occurring in your current jump. The Anvil can generate up to 1 cubic meter of metal per week, and in any increments you want, a small switch on the side of the Anvil lets you decide if the allowed generation builds up or is just reset to 1m3 at the beginning of each week.,,
Exemplar - Temporal Calculus,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,"Even a breath on the scale can determine success or failure. See the breath before it forms, and all scales balance in your favor." - Han Jae Moon, The Inexhaustible Burden%%%%Let’s be honest, does anybody actually like Calculus? Well this kind at least doesn’t need you to personally do anything so be thankful for that. This is due to being a facility with a computer that, when activated, reads the state of every particle in the universe and then puts out a prediction for what will happen based on that. However this is not perfect, thanks to thermodynamics and quantum shenanigans the predictions are not perfect, and reality will increasingly deviate from them the older the predictions are. For example a prediction on drawing a single card from a shuffled deck will be perfectly accurate if you do it immediately but a few minutes later, it will have a possible error of being 3 cards away from your prediction. And the more specific the prediction the more it will decay over time.%%%%If you do find yourself in a purely deterministic world however, the predictions will be perfectly accurate and your knowledge of them will not change that.%%%%If you don’t want a building sized version of Laplace’s demon, then you can turn Temporal Calculus into a book which gives whoever has it on their person a version of the deterministic prediction that goes up to a week into the future. This precognition is only known as long as the notebook is on that person, if removed or its form is changed then the holder will forget the prediction over the course of an hour. Oh, and also the notebook contains the exact formulas used by the larger version if you want to recreate it or do the math yourself.,,
Exemplar - Daedalus Ladder,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,"Beyond this flesh, Beyond this dream, I have danced among the stars. My children dance on endless worlds." - Kavitha Thakur, Glorious Key of the Exodite Sutra%%%%You there Jumper! Step right up and see the wonders of the Daedalus Ladder, a state of the art facility that enhances anybody who undertakes its amazing treatments! Not only making someone better but wholly replacing their physical body if need be; the steps of this upgrade being as such:%%- Cyberization: Augmenting the failing body with machines, maintaining life. %%- Reontogenesis: Repairing the genotype and eliminating the failures of heritage. %%- Eidetic Encoding: Creating self-replicating codes that observe and preserve the Ladder within the substance of self. %%- Cliosis: Perfecting the self-memory. %%- Xenography: Incorporating elements of the psycho-physio-biochemistry of the new world to the self. %%- Mnemosymonization: Embedding the species-memory and optimizing cognitive operation.%%- Reprogenesis: Transferring the Ladder to our unborn offspring. %%- Archezation: Extending the lifespan arbitrarily, creating the choice of when to experience death. %%- Ataxification: A shutting-down of the old self, allowing the Laddered creature to become the new self.%%%%Any of these steps are optional, and can be interpreted as you wish (ie: Ataxification being a metaphor rather than literally replacing someone’s identity)%%%%In its smaller form it is a literal ladder which needs to be ascended to grant its effects. Also its holder gets their choice of the ladder step’s order as well as selecting who is affected, but the effect is amplified based on the amount of entities affected so if it’s just one person then it's magnified by 100 times, but the effect is lessened if you use it on 1000 people.%%,,
Harmony - Xenodrome,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,"We learned too late the importance of safeguarding the precious gifts of nature. The parting gift of the elephant was the wisdom to be good stewards of the next planet." - Samatar Jama Barre, This is Not Exile%%%%Probably the most stereotypical thing for an affinity called “Harmony” to have, but it’s like that for a reason. The Xenodrome is effectively a massive zoo which is not only good at holding boring animals like on Earth, but Aliens and more! Well really just Aliens from here but you can probably find other stuff to put here. While in the Xenodrome non-sapient animals are only able to harm anyone with your permission. Additionally any livestock within the Xenodrome will be multiple times as productive and be immune to any diseases.%%%%If you carry it on your person, then any non-sapient organic life will be instinctively motivated to protect you, or if you attack them then they will try to escape rather than fight back. Remember that this does not mean only animals, plants and fungi work fine with this. Oh, and for some reason it looks like a pet toy when it's like this?,,
Harmony - Resurrection Device,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,"I went to depart this world. I stood at the threshold and I heard, 'Do not leave, we need you!' I returned, by compassion moved." - Kavitha Thakur, Bhagavad 4 %%%%The name is kind of misleading, it doesn't actually bring back the dead but what it can do is that whenever someone is placed within their cells are greatly rejuvenated, effectively reversing aging as well as removing any foreign diseases or parasites. This version also works on things the original wouldn't such as curses and possession. If you wish to turn its power outward the device can be set to influence an area the size of a large city around it, making the population of said area generally healthier and more long-lived.%%%%In its smaller form it will constantly provide its full bonus to you, in the shape of a piece of jewelry or other small accessory, which grants immunity to all but the most severe of conditions. As well as a regenerative factor that lets you fully recover from anything short of losing a limb within seconds, and more severe injuries can heal in at least a few hours.%%,,
Purity - New Terran Myth,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,"'Rise up, O people,' said the Lord of Cosmos. 'I shall lead you to many gardens.' And the people took their place among the stars with great rejoicing." - The Exodus Sutra I:2 %%%%Faith is a universal presence throughout history, it is what let us bear the strife of the Great Mistake and convinced us that we could find a new home here. Now that we have arrived we should make sure that this conviction will continue to inspire our people, with the New Terran Myth they will not only believe in your nation but also your personal goals, seeing the progress of one as the same as progress of the other. Any group of the same species you bring into your nation will also integrate into it better as the New Terran Myth can be seen in any human culture in existence, if you bring non-human races into the fold then the process will take longer, but the more religious they are the quicker they will align with the rest of your people.%%%%What is faith to you though? Is it writing, gods, art, or priests? Regardless of what you take it to be, this symbol of your faith is what lets you know that you can overcome a challenge or when to cut your losses, no doubt will be placed in your mind by those trying to lead you away from your path, no cruelty can shake your mind, no deception will make you turn from what you truly believe.,,
Purity - Crawler,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,"John Henry smiled at the Crawler and he said: 'Sure, you can move a lot of dirt, but let's see who gets to the Mohorovicic discontinuity first.' And he picked up his shovel and waited for the starting gun." - The Uncle Nevercloned Stories %%%%A major problem of construction is that the materials to build something have to get to the place where something is made. We've come up with all kinds of ways to do this, rivers, carriages, trains, boats, planes. Now we are going the other way instead, how about instead of bringing resources to a factory, we bring the factory to the resources? The Crawler does just that, being a mobile factory the size of a few city blocks. The Crawler is capable of easily mass producing items up to the size and complexity of an early 21st century car, but it will take longer to make anything larger or more complex without sacrificing quality.%%%%For example: it can make prefab housing with full utilities or an advanced computer of the aforementioned time period in the same time.%%%%The only thing that it cannot make is another Crawler, since somebody put some really good copy protection on the schematics. The Crawler also comes with its own workforce which is adapted to suit other jumps and their living quarters, the movement of the Crawler is around 60 kilometers per hour while maintaining production but can speed up to twice that at the cost of stopping the factory functions.%%%%When miniaturized it will become the size of a small refrigerator and any staff will be placed in stasis until the Crawler is brought back to its original size, but when it is in this state you can use it to upgrade anything put through it. When something is upgraded it is made twice as good at its intended function as it originally was. Anything can only be upgraded once and biological components are not upgraded.%%,,
Supremacy - Deep Memory,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,"You may say: 'I remember,' but we must also remember what our parents remember, and what our parents' parents remember as well." - Samatar Jama Barre, This is not Exile %%%%Knowledge is power, and the powerful control who gets access to that knowledge. The Deep Memory is an archive of all the information that you wish to be stored within, compatible with any method of data storage as well as directly copying your memories into one of them. At the beginning of every jump the Deep Memory is updated with a “history of the world” for the jump you are going to as well as for the jump you just left. The latter will show the next 100 years of history and biographies for companions who stayed behind, whereas the former will fill you in on the events from the last century including information which would normally be reserved for clandestine organizations or other secretive groups.%%%%Its smaller form is a notebook that, when opened, gives its user a synopsis of the history of whatever is written at the top of a page. This summary would state as much information as can fit on a single page and if used on a person would only tell you what they would, not explicitly consider secrets for example, so you can check where somebody’s been, but not directly get an answer on if they committed a crime. This all depends on the person in question though so more paranoid types are going to have less written about them than someone with nothing to hide. If used to check physical characteristics then the Deep Memory will tell you anything that could be known with what you have direct access to at the time, so carrying around a breathalyzer would be able to tell you their blood alcohol content.,,
Supremacy - Cynosure,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,"Behold unsleeping Cynosure, the golem whose minds span kalpa." - Kavitha Thakur, Kali Meditation%%%%In the old myths, the wise men and those who could see the future often spoke in riddles. The second part is not wholly wanted, but regardless the Cynosure is a seer for our times, a massive AI system which uses its power to answer questions posed to it. The answers however are not direct by any definition, with their significance usually unknown until the original question was around halfway solved. You are also able to limit who can interact with the Cynosure by controlling who it will recognize the presence of.%%%%You can also carry it with you as a magic 8 ball which gives answers just as cryptic as normal but limited by only answering equivalents of yes, no, or maybe. You cannot take apart any version of the Cynosure to reverse engineer them into something that would give you a straight answer, or be incorporated into yourself.,,
Friends in High Places,,3,,00,,False,,True,,50cp each, 250cp for eight%%%%Back on Earth your nation foresaw their politics carry over into the new planet, notably you, who even brought in a companion to be another sponsor. They get 600cp and their choice of drawbacks except All Alone and To the Stars Once More. %%%%Also, The Great Filter or Malignant Miasma must be taken by you and all companions if anyone takes them, everyone does get the CP from them though.%%%%Note that these companions will not count towards the amount of other sponsors on the planet%%,,
Respected or Feared?,,3,,00,,False,,True,,200 CP / 450 CP%%%%Not bringing in any friends? Well this is a great time to make some, if you pay 200cp then you can bring along a version of them that is guaranteed to have the affinity of your choice. They will always have the preparations of their origin, and for another 250cp they get to have the first three perks of their affinity. Each sponsor gives you a one time discount on one of their origin’s wonders, though it doesn’t stack with  your own origin.%%%%List of canon Sponsors: https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Sponsors_in_CivBE,,
City on a Multiversal Hill,,3,,-4000,,False,,True,,So you want to bring a piece of a highly advanced and loyal society with you? Well say no more! This brings with you any single city that you had control of during this jump, by single city I mean its urban area, so you can’t connect your entire nation with suburbs and bring it all, though if you highly develop the area then it counts. The city can be placed anywhere unoccupied within a jump’s main setting (ie: not in space for a jump without space travel), the city will be considered an advanced isolationist society before your arrival and will be unharmed until then. After that, its direction is in your hands.,,
Haven’t I done this before?,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Well perhaps you have! Should you have been to the Civilization Jump previously you may import your people from there, free of charge! Taking this option means that any relations with foreign powers has potential of carrying over from that jump and if you were building a non-human society then that race carries over for free. If there was no more competition left when you finished the jump then you must take either:%%%%All Alone and The Only Good Bug... as drawbacks with half cp gain , and also an extra 200 CP to spend on preparations, this also locks off any companions until after the jump is over.%%%%- or -%%%%Pariah and Late Arrival with full cp gain.,,
All Alone,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,The Seeding was mostly a failure, except for you, who ended up landing on the planet only to find no signs of your fellow sponsors, or stations, or even resource pods. There are still progenitor ruins and aliens though, but your people are now the last hope not only for a nation, but for all of humanity. Remember the aliens are hive minded and you are the only thing for them to target, so good luck! Any companions will not be joining you until the end of the jump,,
To the Stars Once More,,4,,20000,,True,,False,,What? You didn’t think that just a few others wanted to escape the shipwreck of old Earth right? You can take 25 CP for an extra station, up to 8 for 14 total, or 100 CP for an extra sponsor to land, up to 8 for 12 total. Each purchase for a sponsor also makes the planet larger to compensate but Stations don’t add extra space. Companions are not allowed to take this drawback.,,Taken eight times for sponsers - 800 CP%%taken eight times for stations - 200 CP%%%%Retail rocker
The Only Good Bug...,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You know that thing your colony landed on? Well, it turns out that it was an alien nest, so the good news is that it is gone, but the bad news is that there was not any xenomass below, but also you royally pissed off the aliens. They are angered specifically at you so they will target your cities and troops when given a choice but to other sponsors they will act normally, attacking when approached but preferring to keep their distance.,,
Falling Tide,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Floating Cities? Hybrid affinities? Archeology? Sorry but we don’t have any of that here. If you want to go live on this planet, your cities are staying on land, picking one affinity, and all you can find from digging up ruins are small resources caches or an insight into a later technology if you’re lucky. If you still buy a second affinity, one of the companions locked by this drawback, or any of the 200 CP origin wonders they will only be locked off until the end of this jump. Any cities you have can be converted into aquatic ones at the end of the jump.,,
The Great Filter,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,The Fermi Paradox has been resolved thanks to our escape from Earth, though unfortunately the biggest hurdle is the formation of multicellular life, so hopefully you brought some way to get food with you since bacteria alone can’t feed a Civilization. Xenomass is still here though but it's in a form that's much less organic than normal, but all the fancy biotech still needs it.%%%%Incompatible with The Only Good Bug...,,
Malignant Miasma,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,So remember how I said that Miasma is toxic right? Well it turns out things are worse than expected since now it's downright acidic, and also nearly everywhere other than the open ocean. Also the tech made by Harmony seems to not work as well as intended, only holding back the damage caused rather than stopping it or using it to their advantage.,,
Pariah,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The other sponsors just hate you, this could be some long seated grudge from Earth, personal animosity or anything else. Regardless you are going to be hard pressed to find allies among the Seeding unless they have run out of other options. Your companions are not fully immune to this either, as they will not directly oppose you but will hesitate to help you and when they do they are constantly looking for a way to get away from doing what you want, this will not affect companions’ decisions to stay or leave at the end of the jump.,,
Late Arrival,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,For whatever reason you showed up to the planet with a significant delay, long enough for the other factions to begin developing their affinities and claim most of the good land. At least you will be able to be seen as less of a threat than if you were there from the start, unless you are the reason why they left in the first place.%%%%Incompatible with All Alone,,
Ideologue,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,A normal practice in negotiation is to start at a point asking for more than what is reasonable and then go downward to make yourself seem willing to compromise, you forgot about the second part of that. You will not be willing to negotiate with leaders of other affinities unless they are saying something along the lines of “I surrender”, and you are prevented from incorporating the ideas and technologies of other affinities unless they have been completely defeated.,,
Coordinated Opposition,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,The nations following affinities other than yours seem to always get along better than yours, defending each other, making mutually beneficial deals, and defending each other when in danger. It's almost like they’re making arrangements behind your back, but no matter how much you look into it everything always turns out to either be up to luck or something you overlooked.,,
Terra’s Steward,,4,,10,,False,,False,,When you were leaving Earth, you saw someone who looked quite out of place, a large, regal man who seemed to know more than he was letting on. The God Emperor of Man is currently content to stay on Earth regardless of your choices, still just watching even in the case of a Supremacist invasion. Just think of him as a sign of what might happen...,,
The Great Crusade Marches,,4,,9990,,False,,False,,Nevermind what the last one said, the golden man is here and he’s angry. Regardless of what you believe, or what affinity you chose, he now sees you as an existential threat to humanity’s future, and will bring down all his might to stop you here and now. Oh and instead of the generic Aliens that are here normally you need to deal with Tyranids, who are immune to anything that would render them more tame or docile.,,
Victory Conditions and Rewards,,6,,00,,False,,False,,The jump as a whole ends 20 years after any sponsor achieves one of these, if the victor is not you it is not considered a Chain failure, unless they have a Domination victory, but you will not have any of the rewards in the respective section unless you are the first.%%%%Depending on which Victory you have achieved you will be rewarded accordingly, though just for showing the other sponsors how its done you get:%%- Any time you lead a society, or even a small group of people, you will be able to apply the ideas of your affinity or whatever ideology you otherwise have, and they will be followed as long as your subordinates are loyal to you.%%- Each jump you visit after this will have an embassy of your Civilization in the capital of any major nations of your choice. If you already had this from the normal Civilization Jump then it gets upgraded with the technology you acquired here. The upgrade can be the entire building, an extra wing, basement, or higher floor or any combination thereof.%%%%If you have won in multiple ways, then you may pick one of the rewards based on which victories you had, except for Contact which is able to be taken as in addition to the one that you chose.%%,,
Domination,,5,,00,,True,,True,,The most straightforward of these goals, make sure you are the last hope of humanity by making sure the rest are either loyal to you or dead. Unlike the source material however, taking the capital/first settlement off of everyone is not enough to declare victory, you need to take every single colony from all of the major powers, minor stations can be left alone with no repercussions as they will surely acknowledge who is allowing them to live. Another faction achieving this is considered a chain failure for both starting options.%%%%If you took All Alone then your mission is to control the planet itself rather than your fellow colonists. If you can have surveillance over 90% of the surface and be able to move military forces to anywhere on that range within a day then this planet is well and truly yours.%%%%%%Reward:%%Show them who is REALLY in control. You not only make everyone around you acknowledge your military prowess, but you are also able to summon a unit of your affinity.%%%%https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_units_in_CivBE#Military_Units%%%%The amount of each you can summon is based on how advanced the unit is and how many factions your Civilization destroyed or held dominion over, so if you went nuts with To the Stars Once More and did everything yourself then you can get 12 “Ultimate” units (Xeno Titans, LEV Destroyers, ANGELs), with other units this changes in steps based on total affinity level of them, so you can have twice the number of 9 affinity units as 12 affinity ones, You are restricted to units of your affinity and its hybrids.%%%%Unit Affinity total, (Harmony, Purity, Supremacy)%%Hybrid: (HS, HP, PS)%%%%12 (Xeno Titan, LEV Destroyer, ANGEL) - 1 per Civilization destroyed%%10 (Aquilon, Throne, Golem) Hybrid - 3 per Civilization destroyed%%9 (Rocktopus, LEV Tank, SABR) - 5 per Civilization destroyed%%8 (Geliopod, Architect, Autosled) Hybrid - 15 per Civilization destroyed%%7 (Xeno Cavalry, Aegis, CARVR) - 30 per Civilization destroyed%%6 (Nanohive, Immortal, Drone Cage) Hybrid - 50 per Civilization destroyed%%4 (Xeno Swarm, Battlesuit, CNDR) - 100 per Civilization destroyed (Xeno swarm counts 1 as 1 handler)%%%%,,ANGEL or CARVR depending on the actual unit metrics%%12 Civilizations destroyed due to To the Stars Once More:%%- 12 ANGELs or 360 CARVRs
Transcendence,,5,,00,,False,,True,,The culmination of Harmony’s work, to contact the hivemind of the planet and become one with it. In order to accomplish this task your colony will need to have an understanding of transgenics (genetic modification), swarm intelligence (in terms of AI), and nanorobotics, your people must come to these findings themselves but you are allowed to help them to their conclusions. Using the aforementioned technologies you will need to create a “Mind Flower” a massive artificial brain connected to that of the planet’s consciousness, during the process of connecting to the planet the aliens will be enraged and attack it. The connection is also very slow, unless you construct smaller “Mind Stems” throughout your cities to amplify the power of the Mind Flower and accelerate the process. If someone else is working towards this victory then the deciding factor is whomever has the most minds dedicated to the project, as in how many mind stems are built as well as the population of your respective factions.%%%%If you took The Great Filter then the planet is still alive, just in a dormant state until the Mind Flower activates, then instead of agitating the aliens, the planet will be wracked with natural disasters, the others will know however and any sponsor who does not see the truth of your endeavor is likely to attempt to silence the great chorus of the planet.%%%%%%Reward:%%The Mind Flower opens and so does your own mind, you see through not only two eyes, but thousands, each and every one of them being another facet of your Civilization. Who are you? Are you the leader of the nation who enacted this project, or the awakened planet itself? I’m not the one who decides that, but whoever you are you can now use the hivemind to your own purposes, with both human and alien drones acting out of as much autonomy as you allow them. Your control and power is to the degree that you are capable of pulling outside minds into yourself, but the stronger the mind of the target the more difficult it is to do so.,,
Promised Land,,5,,00,,False,,True,,For the followers of Purity, their ultimate goal is to mold the planet into a new Earth and rescue our homeworld’s inhabitants and bring them to salvation. To do this however you will need to construct a Warp Gate to bring the people of Earth to this world, the Exodus Gate primarily requires you to recontact Earth, perhaps through an advanced communication satellite? As for the structure itself you will need advanced nanotechnology, capable of engineering on the scale of individual particles. The final step in saving those left behind is to settle a majority of Earth’s population on the planet, the Gate can bring in 1,000,000 people per day (the population of Earth is assumed to be stagnant and similar to the early 21st century), and any losses will not be counted as being settled on the planet. If a competing faction is also bringing in colonists then whomever settles the most of Earth’s population will be victorious as they will be considered the saviors of an entire planet’s worth of our illustrious race.%%%%%%Reward:%%Welcome back to Earth Jumper, feel free to get used to it since this Earth has experienced a great renewal thanks to the works of… just messing with you, you should be proud of what you did, saving billions of human lives and delivering them to this new paradise. And as a reward you can bring this beauty to the rest of the multiverse should you so wish. Gaining the ability to turn the ground beneath you into any biome suitable for human habitation within an area around the size of a large city. Your people will never be found wanting for a homeland, not only will your Civilization be thankful for your gifts but your human enemies will also be doubting their cause upon seeing the fruits of your labor, to such a degree where whole armies could just defect to you unless they are either not human, or their own belief is able to overcome what is in front of them.,,
Emancipation,,5,,00,,False,,True,,Supremacy’s goal is similar to that of Purity, but with some key differences. You still need to contact Earth with a communications satellite, and build a Warp Gate to Earth, but that is where the comparisons end as the Emancipation Gate is constructed using hypercomputing, making computers which operate at near light speed. Most importantly, instead of bringing the population of Earth here, you will be invading Earth with your forces and liberate them from their biological prisons. The fools back there do not know what is best for them though so they will resist, in vain, so we need to bring the equivalent of 500 of our best infantry companies as despite how downright primitive Earth is compared to our technology, logistical concerns are enough to warrant a larger force. The Gate does need time to charge however so we can only send a force around once per year so make them count, also as we need to use our military to liberate Earth our enemies will see us as more vulnerable for it, don't worry though, since when has a two front war ever gone wrong? If another sponsor has also built an Emancipation Gate, then your forces will share the relations you have on the planet, allies will count toward your efforts, and enemies will fight yours.%%%%%%Reward:%%After the Emancipation of Earth, we had a problem, there was simply not enough materials available to properly enhance our new population, so we came to a realization, we have already known human brains are just chemical computers and could be uploaded into a more perfect form, so its a simple extrapolation to… change some things after the process, so instead of direct control of a mechanical body, we are going to store their minds to massive server farms which let us fit the entire population of Earth within around 5 cubic kilometers of space. Within they are simply going to be experiencing their lives as before, but without any interruptions that the natural world could create, and if their services are needed then the individuals within can take control of networked machines to do as they did on this planet, but without the risk thanks to being backed up into the network. The main control of this system is inside of your warehouse and this also adds on a server farm that can be expanded whenever necessary, alternatively the servers and core of the system can be placed in one of your embassies given before.,,
Contact,,5,,00,,True,,True,,Not some ideological fanatic? Do you not want anything to do with Earth or the hivemind? Well we have found signs of mysterious ruins with technology that even the supremacists find to be impossibly advanced, we think that we can find a way to make contact with them but first we need a starting point, perhaps we can find a lead in their ruins or if that fails a space telescope should find the Signal. After you have found two pieces of the Signal you need to parse it into something you can understand and more importantly make understood. Using the Transcendental Equation project (which requires its researchers to be in some part human) we can decode the Signal and trace it to its origin, to do that you will need to have at least two samples of the Signal to ensure your findings are correct. To finally send a response to these Progenitors you will need to construct a Beacon to make contact. The Beacon requires no specific technology or resources but needs an immense amount of energy, when you first activate it you will need a large amount (100 times what the fusion reactor you can take from Earth can produce) and from then on any energy surplus after your expenses will be used to sustain the Beacon. This will end in 50 years, when you greet the first non-human intelligent life and settle once and for all the question “are we alone?”.%%If there is another attempting to make contact then whoever sends the first message is considered victorious.%%%%%%Reward:%%So about those Progenitors… it turns out that after you left, your nation kept going until they figured out how to screw with spacetime, and then tried to go back and fix things but failed and had their outposts reduced to ruins over time. Then becoming known as the Progenitors by the soon to land Seeding project, you just picked up on the signal sent by their headquarters in this time period. So since they can’t directly give you their best tech thanks to me, they’re just giving you a watered down version. So your Civilization, and you by extension, now has access to small scale interplanetary teleportation, time dilation, designs for vehicles capable of space travel, and weaving matter at the atomic level. This also has the side-effect of resolving any paradoxes you might cause if you ever decide to mess with time-travel.,,
