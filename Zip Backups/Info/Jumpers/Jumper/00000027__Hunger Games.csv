The largest city in the nation and serves as the seat of the nation’s central government. This city is built upon the efforts of the twelve Districts and such it is the wealthiest and most decadent place in Panem. The people you’ll meet here are as strange as they are wealthy and perhaps you might even meet the ones who truly have power in this world. What you do here is up to you. Will you mingle with the rich and powerful or will you leave, taking some of their luxury with you%%%%II – District 1%%Located north of the Capitol, District 1 is the wealthiest District with it’s wealth only being outclassed by the Capitol itself. District 1 is also one of the three Career Districts with many of Tributes here being volunteers. The people who live here are glamorous and District 1 is responsible for producing many of the luxury items and because of this, they have a rather close relationship with the Capitol. This doesn’t make them exempt from the Games however. No District is.%%%%III – District 2%%Found at the south end of the Capitol, District 2 is responsible for the Peacekeepers of Panem along with the weapons and masonry of the nation. District 2 is also one of the three Career Districts, alongside District 1 and District 4. The tributes that come here are said to be particularly eager and bloodthirsty. Loyal to the Capitol, even District 2 is not exempt from the Hunger Games.%%%%IV – District 3%%Despite what some people think, District 3 is not a Career District. District 3 is found in the northwestern corner of Panem and the District is responsible for the technology found throughout the nation. The people that live here have ashen skin and compared to the Career Districts, this one is definitely poorer. Perhaps it was a punishment for their eagerness to rebel.%%%%V – District 4%%The final Career District, District 4 is located on the West Coast of Panem and is responsible for the fishing industry of Panem. Most of the people here have experience with fishing, knowledgeable about the use of nets, tridents, other fishing tools and with quite the experience with anything about the sea. The tributes that come from here are just as deadly as the ones from the other Career Districts so be careful not to underestimate them.%%%%VI – District 5%%This District is responsible for providing power to the rest of Panem. Electric, solar and nuclear. You name it and they know how to get power from it. This District is found fairly close to the Capitol in the southwest direction. One of the wealthier districts, similar to the Career Districts, and despite their enormous responsibility over the nation, they too are not exempt from the Games.%%%%VII – District 6%%Located near a body of water once known as Lake Michigan, this District is responsible for the creation of the various forms of transportation used by the nation, from the high-speed trains connecting the Districts to the Capitol to the hovercrafts used by the Capitol in times of war. District 6 is one of the middle class districts and all in all, it’s one of the better districts to live in, if one doesn’t count the drug addiction that seems to be a problem here.%%%%VIII – District 7%%Found in the northern region of Panem and located fairly close to District 4, District 7 is a region lush with trees of every kind and thanks to that, this District provides Panem with lumber and the paper that they use everyday. Thanks to their industry, the citizens of this District are very good with axes.%%%%IX – District 8%%Located in the north, near a place once called Lake Ontario, District 8 is responsible for the textile industry of Panem. This District is distinctively urban and industrial. You’ll be hardpressed to find even a single blade of grass in this place, especially with the smoke all around.%%%%X – District 9%%The Bread Bowl of Panem, District 9 is responsible for the production of the harvests that the nation needs to thrive. Found to the northeast of District 10, near the once Great Lakes, this District, despite the harvest industry, is ironically one of the more impoverished Districts, similar to that of Districts 10, 11 & 12.%%%%XI – District 10%%District 10 is found in the southern area of Panem and they are responsible for handling the livestock of the nation. The majority of the District is made up of open space and farmlands. Just like the rest of the final Districts, District 10 is an impoverished one. In the Games, District 10 has had few winners and is hardly ever a favorite of the Capitol.%%%%XII – District 11%%Located South of Panem, District 11 is one of the larger Districts and is the District of agriculture, responsible for the production of fruits, flowers and dairy. Almost all of their produce is given to the Capitol and those who steal produce are publically whipped and perhaps executed. This makes District 11 one of the poorest Districts with only District 12, matching them in that area. Most of the citizens here have dark skin and those that don’t are considered to be notable exceptions.%%%%XIII – District 12%%The smallest and poorest District, District 12 is responsible for the coal industry. Located far from every other District in an area once known as the Rocky Mountains, District 12 suffers from a lack of electricity and a lack of food. Most of the people here are starving and few can escape from their suffering here for as long as the twenty foot electric fence surrounds the District. Throughout the entire history of the Hunger Games, there have only been two victors from District 12. One is dead and one is a broken alcoholic. Good luck.%%%%XIV – FREE CHOICE%%You’re a lucky one. You get to decide where you end up in for free. Perhaps you can start off in the infamous ruins of District 13 though I don’t see why you want to go there with how empty and deadly that place is with the bombing aftermath. Perhaps you can even choose to start off outside of Panem and see what you can do from there.%%,,
