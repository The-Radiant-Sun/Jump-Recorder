Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Magician,,0,,00,,False,,False,,To be a Magician is to be an academically trained practitioner of Magic, though you may have to wait a day or two to be invited to attend Brakebills Academy in New York City. A person of this Origin, up until now, was just a mundane academically-inclined individual who was probably on their way to or already attending a prestigious college of some sort or another.%%%%Roll 17+1d8 for age,,
Hedge Witch,,0,,00,,False,,False,,To be a Hedge Witch, well, you aren’t going to be getting a standard magical education, that’s for sure. This is really just a catch all term for everyone else that’s Human, magically-inclined, and not a Magician. Like with the Magician Origin, you’ve lived a mundane life until now and either you’ve discovered the allure of Magic on your own or you were invited to test yourself into Brakebills and failed, somehow retaining your memories when they were supposed to be erased.%%%%Roll 17 + 1d8 for your age,,
Librarian,,0,,00,,False,,False,,It turns out that you signed a contract with the Library at some point, for some reason or another. Perhaps you accidentally fell into one of their facilities and a Librarian there saw something in you, or perhaps you’ve been a Librarian for quite some time up until now.%%%%Thanks to your benefactor, however, you’ve been allowed to shorten your contract to the point that it’ll end at the end of this Jump. You’ll have to spend most of your time in a Library of some sort or another for the duration of this Jump and your skills will more than likely be used for the overall benefit of the Library, lest you invite their wrath if you go against your contract. You may start in either a new branch of the Library in New York or in the Neitherlands branch if you so wish.%%%%You may freely decide your age and the age you are biologically, as it seems that those that are apart of the Library are granted a sort of eternal youth during the duration of their contract.,,
Human,,0,,00,,False,,False,,A good ‘ol average Human. A dime-a-dozen in comparison to the other races, a Human that performs Magic does so by drawing upon the Wellspring, which here in this Jump is located in Fillory and whose power is slowly being completely consumed by a certain person.,,
Incubus or Succubus,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,An Inccubus is a male magical creature that preys on women to drain their energy. A Succubus is a female magical creature that preys on men to drain their energy.%%%%Both are basically Human, though they also possess a stubby, spiked tail that they can detach without discomfort, as they grow a new one every spring. As one of these entities, you’re a potent energy drainer that draws energy from Humans through emotional stimuli such as lust or stress, the energy drain being completely unnoticeable and safe to the Humans being drained. Both also have the ability to smell a person’s emotions. The flesh of an Incubus or a Succubus retains it’s energy-draining properties and can be used as a conduit for a Voltaic Transfer.%%%%Like every magical creature, an Incubus or Succubus is not reliant on the Wellspring to perform their Magic.%%%%Energy drained from others can be converted into any form of inner-energy you have available to you, such as Magic, Ki, or Chakra, and can substitute the need for sustenance, like food and water.,,
Leprechaun,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Leprechauns are identical to Humans and were created to serve and entertain the Celtic trickster God Aengus. Like every magical creature, a Leprechaun is not reliant on the Wellspring to perform their Magic.%%%%Since not much is known about them, by buying it here you become incredibly lucky, be it in games of chance or life and death situations. You also gain a very long lifespan.,,
Pixie,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,As a Pixie you look identical to a regular Human but with pointed ears, you gain a very long lifespan, and you gain much more enhanced and honed magical senses and intuition.%%%%Like every magical creature, a Pixie is not reliant on the Wellspring to perform their Magic.,,
Elf,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Elves are identical to Humans but have pointed ears, look and naturally move more elegantly and dexterously, have a natural affinity/Discipline for Nature magics, and have a very long lifespan.%%%%Like every magical creature, a Elf is not reliant on the Wellspring to perform their Magic.,,
Traveler,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,Travelers are rare Magicians who possess the ability to move between worlds throughout the Multiverse, known as Traveling.%%%%As they are hybrids of a Magician an unknown magical creature, they aren’t reliant on the Wellspring specifically when it comes to their Traveling abilities. They are basically Human, despite their heritage.%%%%The primary ability of a Traveler is to be able to transport oneself between places and realms. They are able to modify the way they travel through spells that they tattoo on themselves such as to only travel the mind, or to bring others with them. Travelers gain the Psychic Discipline for free and have telepathy by default. %%%%The blood of Travelers is also magical and can be used in spells such as to create a Mirror Bridge.%%%%Post-Spark this ability can be used to travel between settings, rather than just the base setting’s Multiverse.,,
Fairy,,0,,-3000,,False,,False,,Fairies are mysterious but dangerously cunning magical creatures.%%%%Fairies usually cannot be perceived by humans. To do so, they must make a deal with a fairy, have a deal made on their behalf or use the Truth Key, however since you’re purchasing this with CP you can elect to allow yourself to become visible at will.%%%%Each fairy has the appearance of a pale humanoid that possess large black eyes, pointed ears, slick back hair and a lack of eyebrows. They thrive in moist and humid environments which they also require to plant fairy eggs. In the absence of such conditions, fairies would compensate by taking long baths.%%%%Like other Magical Creatures, fairies have magic independent of the Wellspring and can perform great acts as the the "living embodiment of magic". Fairy magic is powerful and ill-defined which they use to make "deals" to leverage for power, levitate, and perform other acts such as fixing the Wellspring. It does not require hand gestures or words, simply their mind.%%%%Normally Fairies cannot use the same Magic Magicians use, however you alone can do so, if you elect to Take the Magical Potential perk.,,
Vampire,,0,,2000,,False,,False,,Vampires are pale skinned humanoids notorious for their appetite for blood. They possess the ability to transform other humans into vampires with their bite, and can live forever.%%%%This has to be taken with any race other than Incubus, Succubus, Fairy, and Werewolf. You lose this Race at the end of the Jump, unless you want to keep it.,,
Magicial Potential,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You have the ability to tap into the Wellspring and use this Jump’s form of Magic. You have the potential to be accepted at Brakebills University.,,
Discipline,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Magician, 50 CP for multiple purchases if Magician%%%%Disciplines are a Magicians' area of concentration, usually falling under 6 different branches (houses) of magic: Physical Magic, Natural Magic, Illusion Magic, Knowledge, Healing Magic, and Psychic Magic.%%%%By purchasing this perk, you may choose a field in which you particularly excel at naturally when it comes to magic, such as Quaeromancy, a rare field of Magic whose practitioners have an innate magical ability to find things, Horomancy, the field associated with Time Magic, Phosphoromancy, the Magics that have to do with the manipulation of light, or even something as esoteric as “fixing small objects” will work.%%%%The more specific your Discipline, the more potent and more precise it becomes.%%%%You can purchase this perk multiple times.,,
See You at Harvard,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Magician%%%%Or at least, that’s probably where you were going to go before entering into this world of Magic. You now have the intellect and work ethic to excel in a top-grade University, with the potential to graduate at the top of your class. Needless to say that all those who attend Brakebills are some of the brightest students around.,,
Clear Minded,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Magician%%%%Magic requires a focused intensity, a clear view, and an unwavering sureness in order to properly use it, and one must have no doubt that the spell being cast will work. Magicians are supposed to become adept in this skill in order to ensure that they can cast spells without error and that they keep a clear mind, lest they become consumed by Magic and transform into a Niffin, a very powerful facsimile of your former self made up of Magic and lacking a Shade.%%%%By purchasing this perk, whenever you need your mind to be clear and/or need a sureness of mind while performing something, you will do so without fail, and will never succumb to the effects of overexerting yourself past what you are capable of. %%%%This naturally will prevent you from ever being overwhelmed by any sort of energy source you wield.,,
Multilingual,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,CP 100 for Magician%%%%It seems that every Magician in this setting knows at least some of many other languages which they use to cast Magic, and now you’re the same!%%%%You are now forever fluent in every single type of the commonly used languages used in this setting’s Magic system, and you seem to learn new languages ten times as quickly.%%%%Additionally, when it comes to using vocal components in things like Magic, as long as you know what you’re supposed to say you’ll never mess up in reciting it perfectly, and if you’re cut off you can elect to have whatever you were doing fizzle out without any effect.,,
Gifted Magician,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Magician%%%%When it comes to Magic, you are the certainly one of the most gifted people in existence within the limitations of your species. You will naturally have much more capacity for Magic than most of your species, being able to store much more Magic (when applicable), perform Magic far more precisely, and you can learn and develop all things Magic much more quickly.%%%%You are but a sponge waiting to soak up as much Magical knowledge as possible without end.,,
Circumstantial Bypass,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Normally Magic here needs a little thing called circumstances in order to work properly, which are essentially a ton of variables that one needs to account for in using non-Divine Magic. Such examples include accounting for the nearest body of water, the lunar cycle, altitude, age, etc.%%%%With this, however, you no longer need to account for such things when using your abilities, being able to bypass such things as needing to perform a specific ritual under the full Moon, needing to perform it in a specific location, or needing to be a specific age.%%%%Do note that you will still need material components if an ability calls for it.,,
Brakebills Graduate,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Magician%%%%It seems you’ve graduated from Brakebills University at the top of your class sometime during your life. What do you mean you haven’t been to Brakebills? Well, you certainly have the skills, knowledge, and practical experience in all things Magic you would normally learn in Brakebills University as a top-of-your-class student.%%%%Such capabilities you can now perform include the creation of incredibly powerful wards, the reversal of entropy, and a thousand and on different utility spells for anything you can think of. You’ve also mastered the art of Battle Magic as well, assuming you can control your mental state enough to do so effectively.%%%%You now wield a great deal of power in the form of this Magical knowledge, so use it wisely.,,
Magic is the Mother of Invention,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Magician%%%%It seems that you’ve been dabbling the in art of creating Magical objects, and have found yourself to be quite proficient at it!%%%%You’re now a certified genius when it comes to creating and altering Magical objects, be they regularly enchanted or MagiTech, and you have enough base knowledge to create things such as state-of-the-art Magical batteries or warded objects on par with Brakebills University’s wards.%%%%You invent and create new Magical objects incredibly quickly, and can easily deduce the purpose and method of usage of any Magical object given enough time.,,
Doing a lot with Nothing,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Hedge Witch%%%%Most Hedge Witches don’t have much Magical potential to speak of, and often need to be very efficient with their Magic usage in order to get any significant effect. Though that may not apply to you if you have the Magical Potential perk, by having this perk you become much more efficient in using Magic and any other types of inner energy you may possess.,,
Co-opritive Magic,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Hedge Witch%%%%By performing the same spell in sync with one or more people, you can combine and perform levels of Magic that equals the amount poured into the spell as a whole, even if it exceeds your own capacity.%%%%This also applies to any other sort of internal energy you may possess.%%%%Anyone who’s willingly performing this with you will be able to perfectly sync with you while casting, assuming they know how to preform whatever it is you're doing.,,
Hidden Knowledge,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%Knowledge is hard to come by when you’re a Hedge Witch, and yet you always seem to find new material to learn from.%%%%Whenever you’re trying to find hidden, forbidden, or unknown knowledge that exists in a material form somewhere, you gain a very large boost in luck when it comes to locating where such knowledge is stored, sometimes the knowledge in question falling right into your possession if you search long enough.,,
Setting Up a Safehouse,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%It seems you’re quite the recruiter, and this perk reflects that.%%%%Whenever you’re trying to recruit a certain type of person, you’ll end up finding such people much more quickly than you normally would have and your recruitment pitch will be much more effective, assuming there’s benefit to be had for them in some way.,,
Sneaky Beaky,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%Experienced and powerful Hedges weren’t just given the knowledge they worked so hard to attain, and often they had to use less-than-legal or ethical means of obtaining it.%%%%You become a master at all things espionage-related, becoming an masterful spy in your own right, and you gain a massive boost to your skills at infiltrating organizations and avoiding others, be it the law or even Master Magicians.%%%%You could even infiltrate an incredibly authoritarian powerhouse of a Magical organization and still get by using lesser well-known spells or some other very discreet means of avoiding detection or being found out.,,
Illegal Goods,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%The selling of Magical artifacts is a very lucrative business, and what Hedge Witch wouldn’t want their very own Bag of Holding?%%%%You have the innate ability to find any and all black markets within the world you’re on, and will be instinctively drawn towards the market that has what you’re looking for, if you’re looking to buy. You will never get into trouble while perusing or purchasing from a black market.%%%%Not only that, but you gain access to a pocket dimension that holds a flea market-sized black market straight out of this setting! Only you can access it, and it can only be done while you’re in your Warehouse (or when you’re in a safe location if you don’t have one), and inside it will be any and all Magical ingredients and artifacts that can reasonable be found being sold throughout this Jump. The people selling you things will act like NPCs and will accept any form of currency available to you. Items cannot be stolen in this space, and you will be kicked out if you intend to remain in this pocket dimension if you’re not looking to buy products as your sole reason of being there.%%%%This dimension’s black market can be expanded by you at the end of any Jump to include items from that particular setting, as long as you cover the monetary cost that would be equal to expanding the building in question.,,
Max Level,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%Hedge Witches measure their level of overall power by levels, the max being Level 250, at which point a Hedge Witch is nearly on the level of the average classically trained Magician who graduated from an esteemed Magical academy through sheer ingenuity of your Magic usage alone, using more basic level Magics to achieve this. You’re at that level, and gain the skills, knowledge, and practical knowledge necessary for it.%%%%In addition, you gain a massive affinity for munchkining, otherwise known as the art of using and abusing powers and abilities to the point of optimal min-maxing capability, cultivated due to the situation of Hedge Witches not having access to much Magical material to draw upon. Comes with optional tattoos somewhere on your body - stars with keyholes in the middle of them and one to denote your level.,,
Lovable Character,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%People just don’t seem very capable at holding a grudge at you, nor do they seem to account for the amount of times you’ve back-stabbed them when hanging out with you or asking for your aid, with things going so well that they can almost treat you like a friend if you interact with them long enough. It’s almost like your popularity among your theoretical audience causes you to become a constant in the story. In addition, once per Jump - or ten years, whichever passes faster - you may return from the dead, appearing the next day in an undisclosed, safe location.,,
Timeless,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Librarian%%%%As a Librarian you no longer age, unless you want to that is. At any point you can stop and resume your physical aging.,,
Speed Reading,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Librarian%%%%Like a certain Head Librarian of the Neitherlands Branch, you can read at the speed of light. Well, not exactly that fast, but you’re now capable of reading through and understanding text to the point where you could flip through a book and read everything that was in it in a matter of seconds.,,
Beurocrat,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Librarian%%%%You’re now a master at running businesses and organizations. Public library, you got it! Politics? They never knew what was coming. If you’re in charge everything will just work, and probably better than ever before, with an efficiency that astounds the mind. And your employees will never be overworked either, and will - when applicable - have great benefits and a nice working environment.,,
Moving Up the Ladder,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Librarian%%%%Promotion day is every day! Well, not every day, but it seems as if you’re often promoted within a business or organization way too often for you to be but a regular employee. In any organization you’re apart of, you’ll move up the ladder very quickly and without issue, assuming you’re actually doing your job somewhat effectively.,,
Reap what You've Written,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Librarian%%%%Have you been peeking into the books of people’s lives again? It certainly seems so, as you can create the most genius and at times elaborate plans to accomplish your goals.%%%%You are a master planner, through and through, and very few can match the cunning you use to create these master plans of yours.,,
Boogyman,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Librarian%%%%You seem to have a knack for finding people.%%%%You use your resources to their most efficient extent when you attempt to find someone, and you seems to have incredible luck when it comes to finding them as well.%%%%Your scrying spells are much more effective and can pierce many more magical barriers in your attempts at locating your target for reeducation and detainment.,,
Writing what's to be,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Librarian%%%%You don’t need no gosh dern fancy Magic thingy-magigs to write the lives of the people, you’ve got the original power to access the past and future, with full control over when it activates as well!%%%%By focusing on a particular person, you can now write down the life of them, past, present, and future, with the literary might of a master writer, and you can choose to specifically write a particular portion of their life if you wish, such as their future in a year from now. You can only record these written notes at the speed you can reasonably write.%%%%This doesn’t work on deities/gods, nor does it work on yourself, your companions and followers, or those who have anti-scrying or anti-precog protection.%%%%This does nott account for people reading the future of whomever you’ve written of, so be aware of that. It uses post-cognition for writing the past, peri-cognition for the present, and pre-cognition for the future.,,
The Tales of the Seven Keys,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Librarian%%%%You ever feel like you need an manual to do this whole “questing” and “saving the world” business? No? Perhaps at least for giving it to the setting’s heroes?%%%%Regardless, by visiting any public library, at any time, you can find a book once a year. It’ll detail the exact path one needs in order to complete a great quest or goal that’s currently applicable at the time - determined exactly by you - slowly revealing more steps and details the more one progresses in such an endeavor.,,
Fillory and Further,,2,,4000,,False,,True,,The 400 CP is only for purchasing Items%%%%You gain the complete collection and first edition copies of the Fillory and Further series. You may elect to have them come signed by the author, though you may want to hold off on that due to in-setting reasons. These books will always be in pristine condition.,,

If you lose contact of the rabbit before recording a message with the intent to send it to someone, it will be desummoned.,,
Open Bar,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Magician%%%%You gain a wide assortment of your favorite - or requested - alcoholic beverages in the form of a portable bar. The bar infinitely restocks and you can request a new type of drink at any time. Comes with top-of-the-line utilities for drinking, such as glasses, fancy straws/umbrellas, decor, etc.,,

Magic Battery,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Magician%%%%Mayakovsky knew that one day he would need these, and look who’s laughing when the plumber of the Old Gods comes to shut off Magic!%%%%As opposed to Mayakovsky’s or any you can make, this battery, while sharing the same appearance as the ones that appear in-setting, can store an infinite amount of Magic and any other sort of internal energy. This is fiat-backed to never break down or explode violently, so have fun with that.%%%%Just try to avoid getting yourself turned into a bear by a jealous girlfriend, would you?,,
Excorsizing Weapon,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Magician%%%%Like the eventual weapons of Margo, Sorrow and Sorrow, you now have a weapon of your specifications that can exorcise anything, assuming you somehow manage to get the pointy end of it in the person needing an exorcism.%%%%The exorcism will do no harm to the host, though you’re still injuring them by stabbing or inserting this weapon into them, so do be careful,,,
Magical Button,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Magician%%%%You gain an ordinary-looking button in a hexagonal little case. What makes this special is that, upon touching it, one can be transported to the Neitherlands, next to the portal to the world you were just on.,,
Brakebills University,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Magician%%%%You’re now the brand new owner of your very own prestigious Magic academy for gifted youngsters! It’s on the level of Brakebills University and is fully staffed and self-reliant. Like Brakebills your University will invite gifted people from the general area with the potential for Magic, test them, and then teach them.%%%%In future Jumps this’ll - if you allow it to - continue to work and grant the ability to perform this setting’s Magic to select very gifted individuals, and can be imported into any other school you may have.%%%%Everyone staffed here is completely loyal to you and will respawn after every Jump or when ten years have passed, whichever happens sooner.,,
Pocket Watch,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Magician%%%%A magical watch designed by the Dwarves, this item holds powerful Magic that allows the user to time travel and create different timelines. Unlike the original it doesn’t require the Time Key to function, and like the original it can be used to create stable time-loops.%%%%All functions of this watch cease once you’ve died - they will continue to function when you are revived, if that’s even possible.,,
Stoppard Cube,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Magician%%%%This is a clockwork Horomancy device that allows one to travel across alternate realities. It takes around half an hour to fully recharge and be used again. This can be used to travel to alternate timelines as well.,,
Bag of Holding,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Hedge Witch%%%%Does what it says on the tin. It’s a bag that has a pocket dimension that holds up to 500 pounds of stuff, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. You can instantly expel everything in it by inverting the bag.,,

This suite is rent free and Magically maintained, so at least you don’t have go through the trouble of paying rent to a Baba Yaga. This can be imported into any other appropriate property.,,
Mirror Bridge,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%A Magic portal used to transport Magicians - though most of the time Hedge Witches - over vast distances, you now have a large mirror to do with as you wish.%%%%This is constantly active and will take you to any other mirror you’re aware of.%%%%If you fall off the bridge, it fails, or you’re stuck in this dimension for more than an hour, you’ll be booted out of this mirror back to where you stepped into it.%%%%This version of a Mirror Bridge can bypass any and all protections that would protect against this sort of travel.,,

Anti-Magic Pendant,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%This pendent grants the wearer full immunity to spells and esoteric effects being cast upon them.%%%%This doesn’t remove any preexisting Magical effects from before a person put this on, it only protects from future spells and effects.%%%%Does not defend against someone just punching you or ripping this pendent off your neck.,,
Golem,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Hedge Witch%%%%Once every year you can elect to create a Golem of a person you come into physical contact with, which will then be conjured up in your Warehouse or in a location nearby.%%%%A Golem uses some of the target’s energy to create a likeness and general behavior of them onto the Golem.%%%%Golems cannot speak, but are 100% biologically accurate. Golems don’t need to eat, drink, breath, or go to the bathroom, but they can if you wish them to. Anything consumed by the Golem - if it isn’t living - disappears.%%%%Golems aren’t sapient, and act more like NPCs.%%%%These Golems are 100% loyal to you and follow your every command.,,
Library Card,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Librarian%%%%You now have a library card that will grant you full access to any existing library that’s staffed by at least one living or sapient thing, no questions asked. It doesn’t matter if it’s mundane, restricted, or Magical in nature.,,

These coins are single-use batteries.%%%%You gain a new one at the start of every week, and ones spawned in this manner don’t respawn when used like most items.,,
World Book,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Librarian%%%%This is a book holding every location in the local Multiverse. It’s physical size is deceptively the size of a sizeable book, but it’s pages can theoretically be infinite in number if enough ‘verses exist.%%%%This tracks only the locations in the current Jump/setting.%%%%You can immediately open this book to the locations you are looking for, fitting whatever criteria you need to find if possible.%%%%This covers alternate dimensions, planes, etc., but not timelines or other settings - this book gains the ability to hold every location, period, after you gain your Spark.,,
Library Branch,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Librarian%%%%You gain a branch of the Library which can be placed anywhere in a setting during a Jump, and can be recalled to become a Warehouse attachment at any time.%%%%Like a normal branch this branch is staffed by competent Librarians who’re completely loyal to you and never age.

The Resevoir,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,600 CP for Librarian%%%%You gain a Warehouse attachment - or could otherwise import this item into another location if you wish - of a secret sea of Magic water.%%%%When consumed it supercharges and fills up any internal energies, completely any utterly, acting as an extremely powerful mana potion.%%%%You can elect to completely drain the sea for the rest of the Jump - or for ten years, whichever comes first - in order to gain a power boost on the level of Everett or the Beast for 24 hours with no ill effects to yourself.,,
The Poison Room,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,600 CP for Librarian%%%%A room of forbidden knowledge, you gain an ever-expanding room with all of a setting’s forbidden knowledge.%%%%This can be a Warehouse attachment or be imported into a location in-setting at any time.,,

Master Magician,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,A top-graduate of Brakebills Academy, this Master Magician has all of the perks that are discounted for Magician. They are very eccentric and find you to be a very interesting fellow. Since this is a The Magicians (TV Show) Jump, they are very interested in you romantically and sexually. Their appearance, age, gender, and the rest of their personality is up to you to decide.,,
Top Bitch of [City],,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,One of the greatest Hedge Witches in existence right now, this Hedge Witch has all of the perks that are Hedge Witch discounted. They’re very domineering and incredibly bright, but has a secret softer side if one gets to know them well enough. They can be one’s worst enemy or greatest ally. Their appearance, age, gender, and the rest of their personality is up to you to decide.,,
Head Librarian,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,A Head Librarian of one of the many Branches of this Multiverse, this Librarian has all of the Librarian perks from the Librarian Origin. They’re pretty introverted and love all things books, and are a bit mousy in a cute way, and will generally be happy hanging out with a person in a more relaxed setting, be it reading, playing video games, or Netflix & Chill, they’re down for it. They will retire from being a Librarian at any time you want them to during the Jump, and definitely will once the Jump is completed. Their appearance, age, gender, and the rest of their personality is up to you to decide.,,
Geek,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You’re very... passionate... about one thing in particular.%%%%It could be a certain book series, it could be a certain band’s music, or even a video game franchise. Maybe you just like fine wines or art. Whatever that thing is, you’re as infatuated with it nearly as much as Quentin Coldwater is with Fillory.,,
Alcoholic,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,It seems that, like many in this setting, you’re somewhat of an alcoholic.%%%%Can’t get drunk? Doesn’t matter, you crave alcohol for the duration of the Jump, though not to any crippling levels.%%%%Maybe you just really like the taste?,,
Teenage Horomones,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,What are they putting in the drinks here? Many of the cast tend to go at it like jack rabbits at times, and now you can too!%%%%This makes you feel more like you did when you were a teenager hormone-wise, if a bit more stronger. This doesn’t automatically cause you to go on a sexual rampage or anything like that, it just makes you far more likely to do so if you already had the disposition given enough of the effect of teenage hormones.%%%%You may feel a little more angsty and awkward as well, depending on your personality.,,
Loud Mind,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Your surface thoughts aren’t an open book, they’re the air raid sirens to a Psychic’s telepathy. Like Quentin Coldwater in the beginning of the series, you can’t seem to shut your mind up, and this will annoy and possibly frustrate many of the Psychics in this setting.,,
Neuroticism,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You’re going to be much more neurotic for the duration of the Jump. If the main cast seem to be neurotic messes, why not join in on the fun?,,
Harboring a Baba Yaga,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,So... I’m sorry, Jumper, but it seems you’ve got a case of Cranky Old Witch syndrome.%%%%Occasionally a Baba Yaga spirit will take over your body and try and get a place to own and rent out (if you didn’t have property already) and try and charge Magically-inclined people rent. Baba Yaga are very good at getting property like this, and it’s likely you be renting out some high end property without much initial monetary loss to yourself.%%%%They won’t possess you very often, but you will have to set aside some time for the Baba Yaga to collect rent and accept tenants every now and then, lest they take over your body during an important battle or something like that.,,
Early Grave,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Well, it seems as if the story’s initial main protagonist, Quentin Coldwater, has died in an unexpected accident just before arriving to take the test at Brakebill’s University. Can you help avert all of the madness that’s to come without the token protagonist?,,
Dragon Bait,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It looks like some Dragons put out a hit on your body and your loot. You obviously did something to piss them off, and nothing you do can change that. They will refuse all of your demands and they won’t associate with anyone that arrives with you looking for trade or aid.,,
Hunted by the Beast,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The main big bad is onto you, be careful now!%%%%From the get-to the Beast will be targeting you specifically and looking to have you killed. Good luck with that.%%%%Even Deities will not be safe, as the Beast can take one down with the right planning and preparation.,,
Summoned Our Lady Underground,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Well, not exactly. Somehow Reynard the Fox, a God, has been summoned early, killing all of the casters involved, and now has his eyes set on you. Whether that means he’s looking to kill you or if he’s looking to do something else horrific largely depends on your appearance and gender.,,
Magically Crippled,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,For the duration of the Jump you cannot use Magic of any kind, period. Items will still work though.,,
Released the Monster,,4,,6000,,False,,False,, What did you do? Why would you do this? Do you know how many people are going to die, and what catastrophes lie ahead?%%%%Your entry into this Jump somehow corresponds to the release of one of the most powerful entities in this setting that even the Old Gods are afraid of. What’s more is that he will find you to be the equivalent of what his original prison guards and Quentin were.%%%%He’ll be looking to bring back his Sister, and he will do anything in order to do so, after he takes back what was stolen from them by some of the Deities. Be careful, and please don’t piss off the nigh-unstoppable entity.,,
Helpless Without Power,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,All of your out-of-Jump powers, perks, items, and your Warehouse are now inaccessible to you for the duration of this Jump.%%%%A death sentence when combined with the Magically Crippled drawback.,,
What Happens When a Mortal Kills a  God?,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,It turns out that entering this Jump, you accidentally ran over a kinda weak God. Whoops. Well, the Old Gods care not for the specks of dust, only that a speck of dust killed a cell.%%%%When you enter the Jump the plumber of the Old Gods will shut off the Magic running into this setting, preventing those that don’t have their own generation of Magic (Hedges and Magicians) from accessing Magic.%%%%This also blocks off your own Magic powers until Magic is turned back on, if at all, or when the Jump ends.%%%%This cannot be taken with Magically Crippled. Good luck fending off the Beast without any Magical assistance from the cast, Jumper.,,
