Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Time and Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Time:%%You may choose any year between 1945 and 2009 to begin at the start of. You will stay for ten years in this world no matter your choice.%%%%Location:%%This is your country of origin, either your birthplace or the country that created you. Roll a 1d9 to decide where you land or pay 50CP to choose.%%%%1. America%%The newly emerged Super Power of the west. America was the first to begin working on a superhuman project but not the first to finish. They’re rather lax with their spy security and allowed some of the rest of the world to get a head start because of them, including inadvertently funding the superhuman projects of several other countries. The Super God they will come to create is a cyborg named Jerry Craven, a man who thinks he’s gone to heaven and is called back to Earth to save the day from time to time.%%%%2. Soviet Union%%The Cold War is burning hot right now and the Soviets were the first to finish their superhuman project. A killer robot, a brain wrapped in a metal suit, was what they brought to life. It was obsolete in just a few months but they’d not stop trying. Eventually, they’d come back with a much more powerful robot known as Perun, piloted by the same cosmonaut used as the brain of their original robot killer.%%%%3. China%%The People’s Republic is not one to fall behind its’ super powered competitors. Mixing modern science with ancient mysticism, they seek to create a being that can manipulate the body and soul with it’s’ mind. They’ll succeed eventually, after decades of work, with the creation of Maitreya. A horrifically cruel creature that can indeed warp matter with a thought and does so to callously exterminate human beings.%%%%4. India%%The last to create a Super God but the first to have them run out of control. India, in a bid to solve the problems of massive overpopulation, sought to create their own divine hero. Krishna, a product of many sciences coming together as one, will be the most powerful superhuman being to walk the Earth once he is finished being created in the 2000s. He is also of inhuman mental state and sees nothing wrong in slaughtering nine-tenths of India’s population to save the country itself.%%%%5. Iran%%With the increasingly war torn nature of the country, they became desperate for a way to gain the power to win. Seeking a weapon, they attempted to create an empty vessel that would become a channel for the will of God. It is unknown if they succeeded, only that the being known as Malak was the result. A destructive force that drove his creators mad with his mere speech, he was completed in the early 2000s but only emerged from his underground birthplace once Krishna appeared.%%%%6. Iraq%%Counterpart to Iran, Iraq was most foolish of all. Using funds supplied unknowingly by the Americans, they made a thing. A thing that was outside of time and standing against it, which could see throughout all of time and space. Even outside of where he was contained. That thing was named Dajjal and would awaken, only to travel to the very end of days in this world and cause chaos once more.%%%%7. Britain%%The first country to gain their own superhuman and the ones to bring the final doom to everyone. Britain was quite excellent at the espionage game, keeping an eye on every country of import and their superhuman projects in detail too. Their own came about from a space flight gone awry in the 1950s. What came back from that flight wasn’t the astronauts they sent out but a strange created made from the fusion of the team and a fungus that came from space. It was named Morrigan Lugus, after a pair of Irish deities.%%%%8. Australia%%A nice, peaceful place that is left almost completely untouched by all the terrible events that go on here. At least until the mushroom swarm begins. But they’re a hardy folk. Maybe they’ll live on mushrooms. It’s a great place for a holiday, especially the lovely beaches. No superhumans here either, unless you’re the first. They’re all off in Asia. Come to Australia. You’ll have a great time.%%%%9. Free Pick%%Lucky enough to choose on your own. You may choose any country in the world to begin in.,,
Normal Man,,0,,3000,,False,,False,,A normal human. One of a few billion. Who are you? What do you do? Where are you from? Does any of it really matter? To this world, you are unimportant right now. Just one of the parasites hoping for an idol to jerk yourself off to, to convince yourself that everything is going to be fine. But maybe you’ve got the chops to prove those freaky fucking aliens wrong and make something of yourself. Humans do have all that potential. Make your choices wisely and you’ll change the world. For better or worse. If you wish, you may begin this origin as a being with no history or memories in this world. This origin also awards 300CP for taking it.%%%%As a Normal Man, your age is 20+4d8.,,
Super God,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You’re not a human. At least not anymore. You were made, from scratch or from a meaty corpse. A product of human science in the endless arms race, now aiming to create the most powerful superhuman being. You are one of these beings, likely but not certainly being of alien and inhuman mindset to the people around you. With this origin, you gain access to the Godhood section later in this jump.%%%%As a Super God, you have only just been created and thus your physical age is 20+4d8.,,
Master of Fire,,1,,-500,,False,,False,,Man or God, all are brought to a heel before thy wicked tongue. You deal out ferocious burns with ease, mocking the flaws and mistakes of those who stand before you. Even the perfect superhuman Gods that believe they have a right to rule over a mundane human like yourself will find themselves speechless and verbally torn to shreds when you roast them. There’s nothing you can’t give burns unto and while they might kill you for the insults after, at least you’ll die knowing that you always get the last word in.,,
Normal Man - Addition of Religion,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,To some, humans have a biological need to believe in something. Some of those that believe this is true liken it to a drug addiction, selfishly made to give pleasure to the human without any consideration truly given to their target of devotion. Others believe that true faith is able to exist, independent of any pleasure given to the worshipper. Whichever you yourself believe, you are intimately familiar with faith as a concept.%%%%You can make yourself truly believe in anything you wish, to whatever degree of faith that you want to have. You could do this to ensure your loyalty and determination to serve a cause or just to give yourself pleasure from worshipping yet another thing. Up to you really, as to whether you follow the impulses your brain gives or not.,,
Normal Man - Messiah of the Modern Age,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Why not let all that religion nonsense drop dead? Man has come far from its primitive start, banging rocks together and shouting at fire. Why act like a monkey if you have long since evolved from one?%%%%Unlike many humans of the modern world, you have the willpower to stand up and fight for yourself, even when it would be much easier to depend on another, and can ignite the spark of this will inside others who hear your words. They are inspired to begin acting for themselves and working for the lives they want to get, rather than relying on false gods, real or imagined.%%%%Of course, with this inspiration comes a significant amount of willpower to assist their drive.,,
Normal Man - Inhuman Relations,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Above all else, humanity’s greatest advantage has always been its’ adaptability. Never were humans the strongest, fastest or most naturally gifted. They just used what they had and adjusted it to fit the situation. Now that the inhuman is present on Earth, why could the same rule not apply in human- inhuman interactions?%%%%Despite them partially or totally lacking a human mentality and perspective, you are always able to fully understand and see from the viewpoint of any inhuman being you come into contact with, be it an alien mushroom plague, a super-intelligent cyborg or simply a man driven to insanity.,,
Normal Man - Son Returns to the Father,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The scientists of the 20th century, didn’t seem to really know all that much outside of their scientific disciplines. Why, clearly they’d never read Frankenstein or Asimov’s work. Perhaps if they had, they’d be as careful as you are with your creations.%%%%Thankfully, you have the presence of mind to always ensure that your creations have your best interests in mind at all times. Even if you don’t normally have the means to make this happen, your creations will be loyal to you, do their best to accomplish the goals you set for them and try to see those goals from your point of view rather than their own interpretations or at least ask you first before acting, unless you instruct them otherwise on these points.,,
Normal Man - Idoltarous,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Man makes gods out of the silliest of things. A burning bush, a strange branch, a man who says a few nice words. It’s almost too easy, when you know how, to make something into an idol for mankind. And boy, do you know how.%%%%You’re able to easily create idols that draw worship and devotion unto the being or object from those less intelligent than yourself.%%%%The more impressive the object or being you create to be an idol, even if that creation is transforming something that already exists significantly, the stronger the pull to worship it will be for others.,,
Normal Man - Team Leader,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Like just a giant swarm of pack animals, humanity has always accomplished its’ greatest feats when working together as one.%%%%You have an incredible ability to get all but the most violently opposed people to work together over long periods of time, keeping the teams you gather focused on the task, working efficiently and keeping any issues or problems from arising even out of the workplace.%%%%They won’t be friends but they won’t ruin all you and them have worked for by starting fights with each other outside of your view.,,
Normal Man - Double oh Super,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,A few years working with the British secret service really taught you how this sneaky stuff works, given how absurdly good at it the poms are. You’ve become a master spy and a great spy master too.%%%%You’re one of the greatest experts on espionage, physical and electronic, that the world has seen and are easily able to pass those skills onto others.%%%%Sneaking into a top secret military research lab in another country and nicking the research files? A few weeks and you’ll have what you need easy.%%%%What you really excel at however, is keeping things a secret yourself.%%%%Making sure no one ever finds out how you made your national superhuman weapon is easy. Hiding vast technology advancements from your citizens? Piece of cake. Cloaking a rocket ship launch to outer space? It’ll take some work but you can still make sure no one realises you’ve done it.,,
Normal Man - Mountainous Mind,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It’s hard to argue that a human body is not a frail thing compared to the superhuman beings now appearing around the world. But the mind? That’s a lot more debateable. You’re of the opinion that despite lacking in ability, the human mind is in possession of a near unlimited amount of endurance, so long as the person in control is willing to continue.%%%%Maybe you’re the best representative of that, given your mind and the emotions in it are proofed against anyone attempting to influence them from the outside. Even if your body is damaged, ruined or corrupted, your human mind will remain free of any kind of influence, even if the physical container for your mind is affected.,,
Normal Man - Failsafe,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It might be worth just taking a step back from this all. This superhuman arms race, is it really all a good idea? I guess not. You may not have the power to stop your country from foolishly creating a weapon of mass destruction but with this, you’ll at least be able to stop that weapon from being the thing to destroy you all straight away.%%%%Your experiments and efforts at crafting or creating something never backfire on you. When they fail, be it a self-destruction or turning against you, they will instead shudder to a stop and deactivate harmlessly. You won’t automatically know what caused them to go wrong, though you can probably find out with some efforts, but with this no process or invention you make and are in the control of will end in your harm or death.%%%%Others can still be harmed a plenty though, so long as it wouldn’t harm or endanger you as well.,,
Normal Man - Mini Machines,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Advanced technology might be the basis of most superhumans but what if you can’t skip all that and just fit a machine the size of a factory into a man’s arm so he can break a castle with his fist? Pretty neat, I’d say.%%%%You have the ability to miniaturise technology to an incredible degree, fitting machines the size of small buildings into the hand or head of an ordinary human, without facing any loss in efficiency or effectiveness. If you then make them at the usual size, they’ll be far better than they usually would as you pack so much into them.%%%%You’re also incredibly skilled at fitting these machines you’ve made into the biology of living beings, creating effective and viable cyborgs.,,
Normal Man - Humans First,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Humans are far from safe from use for the experiments of the powerful in their pursuit of more power. If you’re unlucky, you could be turned into a subject yourself. But if you are, you’re one of those maybe fortunate few that can turn it back on your captors.%%%%You always retain control over your mind and body when changed or mutated, no matter what is doing the changing, and can even refuse some or all of the changes as you see fit.%%%%Bond with an alien spore and you remain in full control of the new powers, rather than the spore being the controller.,,
Normal Man - God Father,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Impressive as they are, the Super Gods were made by human hands. For all their great powers, they originated with human ingenuity. Great minds like yours are what created these beings.%%%%You are incredibly intelligent, among the greatest minds humanity has ever seen, and the foremost expert in the entire world on a specific kind of science.%%%%Biology, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, whatever you chose to be centuries ahead of the rest of the world in is what you are currently working on a project to create a Super God from. With your experience, you are especially skilled at creating monsters out of your chosen field of science but even outside of that purpose, you are absurdly skilful in creating effective technologies based on your choice.,,
Super God - Choir of Humanity,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Why do the humans look at you like that? Do they think you’re going to do something for them? It might help to know, since it can be troublesome to puzzle out the thoughts of such ant-like beings.%%%%While you may not always know why someone wants something, you always know what any person wants from you, expects of you or wishes for you to do.%%%%Perhaps you could become a god and answer their prayers. Or maybe it really is just all mindless babble to you.,,
Super God - Across the Centuries,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,An alien mindset encompasses far more than just different morals. Your powers have given you an understanding of the world different from those without them, even if they have great social influence or resources.%%%%You’re able to understand vast scales or lengths of time with ease, thinking on a scale of centuries or millennia in the same way a human would place importance on individual days and weeks. To you, a billion or a trillion is just as significant a sum as less than a dozen, unlike humans who become detached from higher numbers.%%%%Because of this, you are never stuck thinking with the mindset of a human, forgetting the advantages that you have, and are always able to think of problems with your powers in mind.,,
Super God - Greater Good,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,A god is a terrifying thing, especially to ordinary people. But not all gods have ill intentions for the world, something you are able to easily communicate to people.%%%%So long as you have sincerely good intentions, people will always understand that you mean good with your actions and give you a lot more trust.%%%%They may still disagree and fight against you if your actions come at too high a cost for them to accept but they’ll never misunderstand and think that you are a monster for what you feel you must do.,,
Super God - A Wind that Changes,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,There’s a whole world out there to reign over but it is ever beset by rivals to your command. Other gods arise from the laboratories of man and it would serve you well to be aware of their presence and movements.%%%%With this, you become aware of any great changes that occur in the world, such as terrible disasters or the birth of a powerful new being, as well as the presence and general location of any beings near or above you in sheer power.%%%%It’s a vague sense, at most letting you know what country someone is in and what direction they are moving, unless they are very close to you.,,
Super God - The Stash,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Those that come to depend on you come to do so in greater and greater amounts.%%%%You possess a literally addictive personality, not helping you make friends, allies or followers but ensuring that once you do make people into such things, they slowly and steadily fall more and more into an obsession for you. The more they interact with you, the more they feel they need to keep interacting with you, just like you were a drug they couldn’t help themselves from taking.%%%%If you wish, you can immunise people against this effect or remove it from those already affected.,,
Super God - From God to God,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Humanity? There’s not much point in interacting with them, really. So small, stupid and weak. The other gods in this world, they might be of more interest to speak to. Thankfully you get along splendidly with other beings that are beyond humanity in both mind and power.%%%%Those that possess extreme power and an alien mindset feel as if you were already their friend upon meeting you. If they already have a goal, they might still attack you, but more often than not they will seek to greet you and speak first before fighting, in hopes of finding a way to assist each other and be peaceful...though rarely will the lives of humans and those beings on their level enter the equation and those alien to you in power and mind might treat you as a human.,,
Super God - Living Idol,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The sight of a God has a certain effect on men, none more strongly felt than when someone gazes upon you.%%%%You are a living god, a being made to be worshipped and your visage and presence makes that fact a clear and evident one. The mere sight of you inspires a potent mix of awe, fear, lust and love in any who witness you, becoming even more powerfully felt the weaker those beings are in comparison to you.%%%%Those on your level or above, other godlike beings, are mostly immune to this effect but the weaklings that suffocate the surface of the Earth are almost helpless to deny you, with only great wills or outside assistance enabling them to resist the lure of kneeling before you and praying for your mere attention.,,
Super God - Non-Sane,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,When you were made, you were made without something most have.%%%%You do not possess sanity, at least not to any who might look upon you and try to figure you out. Your internal mind remains unaltered, in the sense that you will not start thinking differently, but now other people find you entirely incomprehensible. Those attempting to figure out what you might do in reaction to something are left totally lost, those trying to see your thoughts or control those thoughts cannot comprehend a single concept that occurs in your mind even if they can look into it and you are most certainly immune to any attempts to harm that non-existent sense of sanity.,,
Super God - Mushrooms Grow on Dead Things,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The way a human interacts with a God is a curious thing. They are at once respectful and deeply insulting towards the being they worship. They expect you to follow the beliefs they’ve made up about you. Why do they never think, even for their own sake, that you would have your own designs?%%%%Even as an inhuman being, you have a terrifying capability to manipulate those around you into doing what you want, without them ever realising you had done so and sometimes without needing to speak at all.%%%%Planting a seed in someone’s mind to make them make a certain choice a few decades later, convincing a man to let you out of your cage without saying a word to him, so long as you have the time and you are not up against too canny a foe, the world will fall into place for you.,,
Super God - Law of God,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,To harm God is heresy. To insult God is heresy. To even point your sword at God and threaten him is heresy.%%%%These are the feelings that resound through the minds and hearts of those who seek to harm or impede you in any way. An immensely strong negative reaction towards those ideas forms within people, as if opposing or threatening you was outright sacrilegious to them.%%%%Those with powerful wills can overcome this but even those with more power than you will have to use their willpower to get past that barrier that tells them that harming you would be a truly disgusting act.,,
Super God - The Mouth of God,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You may be a god but you have a tongue more befitting a messiah.%%%%The minds of men are putty before you and your words, allowing you to manipulate the emotions and minds of humanity and others like it solely through your speech, not needing any of your special powers.%%%%You could bring an entire city to tears in just minutes or talk men into killing themselves over the course of an hour or less.%%%%You’re a living cult of personality, on the individual and macro scales, and even recordings of you possess every bit the charisma that you have personally.,,
Super God - Fear Not the Super Man,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,What if there was another path for this world? What if, instead of bringing chaos and fear and preying upon the perverse flaws of mankind, a superhuman being was created and remained human? Perhaps that being could change the world for the better. If that being existed, it would have to be you.%%%%Your mere presence encourages the entire world to move towards a peaceful and brighter future with any actions you take towards aiding that goal having a greatly magnified effect, whereas actions that would unintentionally harm it have their negative consequences greatly lessened. With your presence, beings that might ordinarily waver between good and bad land firmly on the side of good and even evil, insane or alien creatures can be redeemed by the heartfelt words of an innocent, much less your own attempts to help them.%%%%The most mad and vile may remain so but the world is most assuredly glad for the presence of a genuinely benevolent super god.,,
Godhood,,1,,00,,False,,False,,This section is exclusive to those who took the Super God origin. Normal Man origin takers may not purchase options from this origin.%%%%Any option that notes it needs maintenance of some kind will also provide you with the tools to do that upkeep on yourself, though it is a slow and tedious job to self- repair.,,
The Iron Giant,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The earliest form of superhuman to grace the world. You, with the help of Russian technology, have become a brain in a jar. That is also in a sizeable killer robot from Russia. You’re twice as big as a man and you’ve long since moved past any biological needs, though your brain fluid will need replacing now and then. You’re strong enough to smash a fortress apart in a few punches and tough enough to take the same back at you, though you’re still at a level where mundane military heavy weapons can threaten you. You’re as fast as a sports car in a sprint and surprisingly spry in combat but your age shows even early on. You’re more like a super advanced tank than a true Super God.%%%%However, for an extra 200 points, you may receive a large series of upgrades. You retain the previous benefits, though you now take the form of a person sized and outwardly human being, even if you are almost all robot inside. Your brain has been split into 5 parts spread across your body, each independently just as powerful and complete as your original brain. Your body has been filled with hundreds of high power weapons and in terms of raw strength and toughness, your blows will cause earthquakes to be felt across entire countries and turn city districts into craters. You’re several times faster than before and the number or redundant systems in you allow you to fight so long as no more than 50% of your body has been destroyed.,,
The Six Point Five Million Dollar Man,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Through the wonders of cold war American science, you’ve been turned into an advanced cyborg. You have enough strength that a single punch from you could pop the eyeballs of anyone within a mile and surpass the destructive power of entire missile salvos.%%%%You can move at supersonic speeds and have greatly heightened senses, allowing you to outmatch even the best the animal kingdom has to offer in sight, hearing and smell. Your body is durable enough to easily take the level of damage you can dish out too.%%%%You won’t ever age again and don’t need to rest or eat, though you will likely require upkeep to keep all your machinery in working order in time.,,
The Mushroom King,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,You were infected with a particular strain of cosmic fungi while on a trip to outer space. Unlike another trio of astronauts, you retained full control of your new form, though you bonded on a deep level with the fungus.%%%%You became a towering creature, easily standing 20 feet tall and holding the strength and durability that entails. You are superhumanly intelligent, like a highly advanced computer made out of meat and fungi. You have the ability to spread spores by exuding them from your body, possibly in vast clouds that can quickly cover entire countries.%%%%These spores are able to infect anything, living or dead, and turn it into another part of yourself. These parts go under your control and the more you infect, the smarter you will become as each infected thing provides more biological-based processing power for you.%%%%With enough time, you could create an entire mushroom world. You do not age nor do you require specific sustenance, able to survive on oxygen or light alone.,,
The Angel of Death,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,An only somewhat scientific experiment to create a vessel to connect to God, that was what created you. Did it succeed? Perhaps. Only you can know for sure whether it did or not. What is certain is the abilities your form received because of it.%%%%You are destruction incarnate, capable of tearing apart matter with a thought or a look, atom from atom and particle from particle. At maximum range you could core out the moon, leaving it an almost completely hollow husk, though it takes a few seconds for you to extend your destructive field to that magnitude. It’s possible to surpass the speed of your destructive ability, though only the most powerful beings in this world would be capable of doing so, such as those that can produce massive amounts of matter at a speed several times the speed of sound. If you’re just working with distances of a few dozen kilometres though, you’ll be able to instantly tear anything near you apart in whatever way you like.%%%%Perhaps as a strange side effect to whatever made you what you are, you have ceased to age or require any sort or sustenance or rest. Perhaps all that’s left to you really is destruction.%%%%You also glow brightly when your powers are in use.,,
The Living Flesh,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Through a seemingly endless meditation upon your own being, and the places between the parts of your own being and the places between those places and so on, along with a hefty amount of scientific assistance, you awakened to power.%%%%You became able to manipulate zero point energy, which enables you to control matter down to the smallest individual particles and quarks. With this came incredible intelligence and mental power, enabling you to almost instantly learn and comprehend anything you perceive.%%%%With a wave of your hand, you could turn a dozen humans into a biological rocket capable of traveling to Jupiter, all the while sending back information to you via quantum entanglement and singing a beautiful song. Without having studied anything relating to that beforehand.%%%%Your abilities appear particularly powerful when working with flesh but you are still able to work with inanimate objects.%%%%You’ve got enough range to affect every living human in a country the size of China when working with flesh but only a fraction of that when working with stone or metal.%%%%You are capable of warping your own physical form just as freely, naturally having become ageless in this process.,,
The Time Lord,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Hello there. This is a bit unexpected. I’d thought my time was done. Perhaps I should know better of where time can go. Are you wishing to become like me then? Silly little thing. But I won’t deny you. It’ll be interesting, seeing how you change things. I, or rather us as it will be soon, am a being that was made to stand against time. And space, but mostly time.%%%%We do not have need of blood or flesh, existing as strange matter formed into a humanoid shape, mostly immune to harm or frailty. Our construction allows us to see time, the future and the past and all that happens in the present.%%%%We see all that could occur in paths that diverge infinitely from each other. And we see all that could have occurred as well. You think you can’t withstand it? Don’t worry that little head. Your mind will be made able to handle it. You’ll even still have your sanity intact. As inferior as it is to tactical consciousness, it’d be terribly boring to have an exact copy of myself walking around. When we might walk anyway. We won’t be doing much of that.%%%%We can travel through time and space, you see. Not without our limits. There’s nothing stopping us from moving around any physical location but time travel of more than a few days can be...difficult. Tiring. Even for us. But we have all the time in the world.%%%%Time can’t affect us if we don’t want it to. Paradox does not exist. What powers us?%%%%An energy source, within our physical forms. It’s very powerful. When I killed myself in the future, it destroyed almost all of Eurasia. Try not to do that too soon. You understand now. Good. I’ll see you soon. Or maybe I won’t remember at all. It’ll be interesting either way.,,
The Artificial God,,1,,-12000,,False,,True,,A living deity. That’s what they’ll come to call the marvel of science you’ve become.%%%%Your body is genetically perfect, cloned and engineered to be the height of what humans are capable of, though it’s only ‘flaw’ is that it is coloured differently to a human, such as having a blue skin tone.%%%%Your mind? An Artificial Intelligence within the partially mechanical brain of the clone body, highly advanced and capable of rapid self-improvement.%%%%Your body has been given special bacteria that can rapidly create metal, allowing for the creation of devices and circuitry to further improve your mental abilities and allowing you to create technology from almost nothing in an instant.%%%%In a matter of days, you would improve enough to destroy entire cities, create armies of machines in minutes or make wonders of technology such as machines that purify the environment with no waste or hyper advanced technology that draws on psychic powers.%%%%Eventually such feats as instantly creating shields around countries the size of India, warping physical matter with a thought on a country wide scale and more will be within your grasp, with no true upper limit to how far you might grow with your powers and mental capabilities.,,
You're Home and Away Forever,,2,,00,,False,,True,,It’s never going away. No matter how hard you try. The Australian soap opera “Home and Away” is now delivered on discs, or whatever sort of format you usually use, to you each week for the new weekly episode. Even outside of this universe and in the future, in places where Australia no longer or never did exist, this television show will continue to be delivered to you. Alternatively, you may pick the similar soap opera “Neighbours” as a replacement.,,
Last Candy Bar on Earth,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Always saved for when you’re feeling down and things are about to go to shit for real. In your pocket, you’ve always got one last candy bar. It’s always one of the sorts that you really like and it does good to calm your nerves if you have it. You’ll find another one in your pocket as soon as you finish eating the first one you took out too.,,
Normal Man - Anti-Fungal Tablets,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A small packet of anti-fungal tablets. These tablets cleanse any and all fungi from within and on the body of the person who takes it and makes them proof against further infection for the next 6 hours.%%%%There’s twenty tablets in the capsule and they replenish at the beginning of each day.,,
Normal Man - Uzi,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A simple, cheaply made firearm from the modern day. An Uzi perhaps or some kind of rifle. It’s a sturdy and trusty thing, with a few full clips of ammunition ready for use.%%%%It’s not the most damaging or the most accurate but you’ll find yourself with more ammunition a few hours after emptying any of the clips you have right now.,,
Normal Man - Survival Kit,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your ready-made end of the world pack. A sturdy cloth and leather backpack that is water proofed completely, this pack contains rations, first aid materials, navigation and survival equipment and even a satellite phone.%%%%All the stuff in the kit will replenish a day after being used, destroyed or lost too, so you can theoretically survive on nothing but this kit, even with a small number of other people there to share in it with you.,,
Normal Man - Last Words,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,As the world winds down to a close, you’d probably want to ensure you’ve got your last words in. Even if just for the cockroach people to find in a few million years. This recording device, an ultra- sturdy camera, has fantastic quality sound and video and is able to transmit what it records live to any connection in the world, provided it’s not protected from such transmissions.%%%%It’s impossible to break, damage or dirty up the camera and it never runs out of power either, provided the power is for the camera itself.,,
Normal Man - Deep Earth Defence,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A secret bunker, hidden several miles beneath the surface of the Earth. A veritable vault, fortified to stand against even the powers of a Super God, though not the strongest of them. This underground fortress has enough room and supplies to support a dozen families for over a century, along with room and tools to create material and food for the future if the residents are properly educated.%%%%It’s not a very comfortable existence but you’ll be able to survive anything short of the entire continent being blown up down here and certainly, no mushroom spores will ever get down to contaminate you.,,
Normal Man - Retro Space Ship,,2,,-4000,,False,,False,,A replica of the advanced space shit that the British used back in the middle 20th century and resulted in the creation of Morrigan Lugus. This shuttle has room for a full crew of 9 and the supplies to support a several week long trip. It’s fast enough to get an 8th of the way to Mars and back to Earth in just 8 days and is completely shielded against anything getting into the space shuttle from the outside, short of a meteor crashing into the side of it and busting it open. The shuttle also comes with the astronaut suits and launching pad needed to send it to space and have it land safely back down.,,
Normal Man - Nuclear Arsenal,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A set of 200 nuclear missiles, with the vehicles to transport and launch them included, that are capable of reaching across an entire continent with their range and reducing most of a small country to radioactive ash if fired all at once. You’d get in a lot of trouble if people knew you had this but thankfully it seems that unless you act really stupid or fire them off, people won’t realise what these are or that you have them even if they really should have noticed by now.%%%%A new set of missiles will appear in future jumps.,,
Normal Man - Hollow Nation,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A small nation to rule over as your own.%%%%Little more than an army with a border, this nation has long since been sucked dry of any culture or life outside the whims of the cruel dictators that ruled it until now, having become entirely focused on military power and defence, though it lacks nuclear capability. You are the ruler of this nation, which is about the size of Pakistan, though it has relatively little to offer you compared to what most other nations have access to.%%%%You will be in charge of a similar country in future worlds, fitted in somewhere on the map.,,
Super God - Divine Duds,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,It doesn’t really do anything but it certainly looks impressive. You have a custom made for your size outfit, based on what a religious or mythological figure once wore. These clothing pieces and items do not possess any powers but make you look rather magnificent, as well as changing to fit on you in any size or shape.,,
Super God - Religious Texts,,2,,-2000,,False,,False,,A God in name and now a God in practice too. Or at least with the stuff you’ll need to set that practice up. You have a large storehouse filled with religious texts based on a religion centred around you now. Thousands of copies of these books are within the storehouse and a printing machine to create many more is also present, provided you give the materials.%%%%The books are very well written, in a manner you would approve of, and so long as people had some spark of belief, could encourage a new religion to blossom into life. Perhaps showing off your powers could be that spark?,,
Super God - Paradise,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,An underground town entirely designed for you. Made in a culture of your tastes, this underground town is maintained and run by a mysterious faction that seems to desire nothing more than giving you a pleasant place to live. Perhaps you wish for the All-American small town experience? Or a more modern, eternal nightlife in a red light district?%%%%The underground town is a few miles wide and every living person in it is a highly skilled actor, dedicated to providing you an interesting and satisfying life in whatever way you desire while you reside in the town, though you may leave at any time.,,
Super God - Super Lab,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,This is where you were made. Or born. Whatever fits. This massive facility, outsizing even a large sports stadium, was built to create a specific kind of Super God.%%%%If you are one, it was built to create a being with the Godhood powers that you possess.%%%%If you are not, you may pick one of the Godhood powers that this facility was made for. The more powerful the target, the more resources it will take to create and the longer the process will be.%%%%Aside from creation, the lab is also able to repair/heal and provide maintenance for almost any kind of superhuman being, though it is particularly effective with the specific sort described above that it can make.,,
Import,,3,,-500,,False,,True,,For every 50CP you spend here, you gain the option to import a single existing companion or create a single new companion. They may choose to be in either origin and will gain all associated freebies and discounted for that origin, along with 600CP to spend on perks, items and possibly powers in this jump. You may transfer points to a single companion on a 1:1 basis.,,
Canon,,3,,-500,,False,,True,,Every time you buy this perk, you may pick one canon character to have a chance to convince to come along with you. If they accept, they become a companion. You’ll be able to meet them at least a few times in favourable conditions to help you out, though favourable may have different meanings for different beings.,,
Drawbacks,,3,,00,,False,,False,,You may take up to 1000CP in drawbacks,,
Holy War,,4,,00,,False,,False,,It is likely that, given the variable start date of this jump, you’ll be spending your entire ten years well before the meat of the story comes to town. With this option, you’re able to extend your stay from whenever you started until when the final moments of Ragnarok occur, during the late 2000s.,,
Monster Made Flesh,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are not human. Why pretend to be? You possess an almost entirely alien mentality to other humans around you. This might manifest as a severe form of insanity or sociopathy, turning you into the sort of serial criminal that makes nightmares for normal people. Or, if you are a Supergod, it will make you every bit the strange being that your peers are in that nature, such as possessing no morals at all, living your life only be deciding what the safest option is tactically or actively seeking the death and destruction of all sapient life.,,
Foul Manners,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,The peer group you would normally reside with thinks of you rather poorly.%%%%Humans will find that they are widely considered to be barely sane crackpots, possibly to a dangerous extent, and that if people aren’t trying to lock you up in a mental institution, they’ll at least never take you seriously in anything more complicated than a fast food serving job.%%%%Super Gods find that cooperation and trust between themselves and humanity is outright impossible and that even interactions with other superhuman beings become nigh impossible, with them almost always starting on a hostile foot.,,
Reckless,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Instead of taking the time to think and plan out what you’re going to do and considering all the possible consequences of doing that thing...you just skip straight to the doing. You’re a reckless son of a bitch if there ever was one and very rarely do you take the time to think about what you do, even when encouraged to do so by others you’ll just start to get annoyed with them and try to force things to start already.,,
A Boring World,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The world is just too boring lately. Too peaceful and empty of conflict. Now that the world war has ended, there’s just no excitement. But there will be soon and you’re going to be right there when it happens. You have an obsession with interesting things, which by your viewpoint are those things that are most dangerous, and desire the world to be full of these dangers. You’ll want to get up close with a lot of dangerous stuff, though not necessarily always the very most dangerous, and will take opportunities given to you to cause further chaos.,,
Everyone Has a Golden Bull,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You’ve found religion my friend. How good for you. Too bad this religion is really unhealthy for you, even compared to most religions.%%%%You happened upon an idol of sorts that you became addicted to the presence of, which could be anything from a charismatic cult leader seeking to use your skills and powers for their own benefit to an alien artefact that saps at the sanity and strength of those near it to a god-beast from outer space. You’re addicted to this thing that is seriously bad for your mental and physical health and it’ll be a constant struggle for you to drag yourself away from your idol.%%%%If you destroy it, you’ll quickly find a new one you must struggle to resist.,,
Spore Life,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The mushroom spores produced by the first Super God, Morrigan Lugus, have somehow managed to infect your body. Thankfully only a small number of them came into contact with you but you’ll still be screwed if the infection progresses too far. You’re unable to remove it fully without dying but with constant medication, you can control it. However, high levels of physical or mental exertion, like stress, will enable the infection to speed up its’ rate of production and influence you more and more. Keep on your meds and keep that heart rate on a calm level and you’ll be fine. Not like there’s anything here that could cause stress.,,
Dajjal is Watching,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,The people in this world...well, they’re not in possession of all that much common sense. Nor does it seem that they really know what the fuck they’re doing, since now that you’ve arrived, they’ve started to screw things up just for the sake of making things worse. Anyone who comes near you will soon enough start to muck things up for the sake of it.%%%%Sometimes it will be small, like knocking over things you put on tables just to watch how you react, but others times...well, don’t go near anyone that is capable of blowing themselves up. Just to be safe.,,
Bigger and Bigger,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,An arms race indicates that all the participants are constantly trying to make something bigger, better and more powerful than any of the other competitors. Unfortunately for both you and the world, the superhuman arms race is well and alive for the course of your time here.%%%%No matter what you do, there will always be more Super Gods appearing in your general location, growing more powerful on average as time goes on. Even if you wipe out all of humanity and other life capable of producing them, they will continue to appear. Perhaps they travel from other timelines or appear spontaneously from nature.%%%%They are not hostile to you specifically, though they do remain hostile to life in general and given they first appear nearby to you, you’ll often be attacked by them or caught in the crossfire of their battles.,,
Super Devil,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,An arms race is more than just a competition to see who has the biggest gun. It also includes a race to see who can make an effective counter to the best thing the other side has first.%%%%One nation seems to have come to the belief that they needed to make a counter to you, resulting in the creation of an immensely powerful Super God. Specifically made to counter you and your powers, they would be among the greatest foes you were ever to face.%%%%The odds of you beating them are...well, they’re pretty bad. Some might say near microscopic.%%%%But they do exist, especially if you seek to lead this Super God to be caught up in battles against the other beings in this world to whittle it down. It may have the powers built to counter you and be incredibly strong in its’ own right but that inhuman mind means it won’t plan for anything outside of you.,,
