Name,,Type,,CP Change,,Active,,Chained,,Description,,Notes
Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Origin,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Independents begin on Coldrock Haven, a station that changed hands several times before Fiasco took it over. If you are a faction loyalist, you'll begin in your faction's headquarters. You may choose your age and sex for free.%%%%If you pick one of the four factions other than ‘Independent’ as your background, then you're a loyalist. You gain +400cp to spend on items, reflecting the extra resources available to you.%%%%If you choose to be an Independent, you get +400cp to spend on perks, representing the broader array of skills defectors have shared with the movement.,,
Independent,,0,,00,,False,,False,,However you came to be here, you've come to see the Drift as your home and other settlers as your extended family. Factionalism has started a conflict that is tearing your home apart, destroying homes and killing good people.%%%%You've joined the nascent revolution, intending to make the Drift safe for people to live in and an independent power not beholden to outsiders.,,
Glitcher,,0,,00,,False,,False,,A fleet pulled thousands of lightyears across the galaxy by an experiment gone wrong, the Glitchers have teleportation tech beyond anyone else. Stranded and alone, the Glitchers resorted to raiding simply to secure food and essential supplies. Survival is all they really want, but the current situation isn't making it easy for them.%%%%The Glitchers are a very open group, and anyone is free to petition to join their collective.,,
Offworld Security,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Offsec is a corporation that's not here for the acid, at least not directly. They were hired by a nearby planet to help enforce a legal claim made over the Drift and its resources but became bogged down by unexpected resistance.%%%%Offsec is noted for its equally extreme stance against killing as much as its willingness to do everything short of killing to accomplish their goals.,,
Foundry,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The very first to settle the Drift, the Foundry were originally a Sovereign mining expedition sent to survey the area. Pushing their FTL drives far beyond their limits to make the trip bricked their ships, and the miners were stranded. Once it was clear that Sovereign wasn't sending help, they built most of the stations within the Drift and made themselves a home.%%%%A society founded by engineers, they believe that every social problem has a tech solution, and when that doesn't solve it, they argue about what's wrong with the tech.,,
Sovreign,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Beyond a megacorp, controlling more planets than most governments, Sovereign is a ruthlessly amoral organization that cares only about profit. They are lethally obsessive in the pursuit of gain, cut-throat in their practices and policies both internal and external.%%%%As nervous as they make outsiders, they remain a company, legally incorporated, with shareholders and a board of directors who set company policy. Or not. It depends on what conspiracy theories you listen to.,,
Throwing Stuff in Space,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You're improbably good at throwing things no matter how unbalanced or awkward they are. Giant wrenches stay on course, and blades always hit the target pointy end first.%%%%If line things up just right you could bounce a thrown wrench off a wall to hit someone just out of your line-of-sight.,,
Glitch Pocket,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have a portable glitch-system that can keep a number of small items in a very tiny container and retrieve them as needed.%%%%The items can't be very large, no larger in size or mass than a sword or automatic shotgun, and you can store about eight of those items and have space left over for ammo.,,
Pod Jockey,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Pods practically fly themselves. You'll arrive in this jump knowing the basics of piloting, but this perk will make you much more skilled at getting where you want to go, and doing so quietly.%%%%Set an intercept course from a long distance away and you'll only need to make tiny corrections on the approach to avoid sensors. You'll slide right up to the airlock and not ping-pong off the hull.,,
Continuity,,1,,00,,False,,True,,It is rather horrifyingly revealed that glitching is the destructive kind of teleportation, killing and copying the user.%%%%Such a thing would normally end your chain, but now this is something you don't have to worry about. If you ever become involved in any sort of Ship of Theseus nonsense that puts into question if you are still you, and there is a 'you' around to answer it, the answer is always yes.%%%%The perk is free for this jump, and costs 200cp to carry to future jumps.,,
Pause and Plan,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You can, at will, put the universe on pause for as long as you wish.%%%%While things are frozen you can do nothing but think and observe your surroundings. You can't affect the world, or yourself, in any way. You can't even move your eyes, but you can take as much time as you wish to mull over what you are looking at.%%%%This perk works just as well with more exotic senses, but the input you got at the moment you froze things is all you have to work with.%%%%In some situations, that's enough.%%%%Time spent frozen counts against the jump’s time limit.,,
Heat Signature,,1,,00,,False,,True,,It's the name of the game, and an edge that will keep you alive. You have a finely-tuned sense for thermal energy around you, out to a radius of about a hundred meters.%%%%There's no instruction manual, so it's up to you to learn how to recognize what is a guard, a turret or hazard, or use your newfound sense to get an idea of the layout of the surrounding area.%%%%200 CP to take to other jumps,,
Independent - Quantum Pockets,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Whether it's your pockets, holsters, or some kind of extra-dimensional space, you can move items in and out of them at utterly ridiculous speeds.%%%%Shooting four guys with four different guns takes no more time for you than using just one. There's no one around that can match your quickdraw, but this speed only applies when pocketing or drawing something.,,
Independent - A Clever Way Out,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your meticulous plan failed, everything went to hell and now you need to run for your life. Again. Thankfully you are very, very good at getting the hell out of dodge.%%%%When things go wrong, and your only concern is running the hell away, your luck soars.%%%%You turn the corner when the sentry turrets are pointed the other way, the guards went left when you'd gone right, and when all else fails, you'll probably find yourself in front of a big window you can use to fling yourself into space.,,
Independent - Rebel Reflexes,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You can react fast enough to make people almost think you're using a slipstream to bend time.%%%%Other people almost look like they're moving in slow-motion, and if you're really pushing yourself you might be able to anticipate and move out of the path of a bullet just as it's fired.%%%%You're still only human, so don't expect keeping up this pace constantly to be anything easy.%%%%Plan your actions, take the occasional breather, and you can burst into a room and drop four guys in two seconds flat. Assuming nothing goes wrong, of course.,,
Independent - Of Course there's a Revolution,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Starting a revolution is hard. You've got to get the word out, overcome every bit of fear and hesitation potential allies may have, get them to work together, keep internal disputes and setbacks from ruining everything...it's a lot of work.%%%%To make things a little easier for you, once per jump, you may insert a thought into the collective consciousness.%%%%This could be anything from 'there's a well-organized revolutionary movement working to liberate the drift' to 'zombies are real' or even just 'flat is justice.' People won't automatically pick up on this idea, but once something happens in line with it all onlookers will have the same first thought. 'Someone has started a revolution.'%%%%They won't instantly believe it, support it, or even like it, but this idea you've planted will always be in the back of their minds.%%%%When something happens that seems to support this thought, people react more strongly to it. When something happens to disprove it, there will always remain a tiny bit of nagging doubt. It's not much, just a tiny nudge, but it's a constant nudge. An idea that can never be truly stamped out, no matter how much anyone tries.,,
Glitcher - Freeglitching,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Most people can easily figure out how to get from point A to point B, and they plan a route based on how well they can run, jump, and climb the way over. The ability to teleport can really skew your sense of 'how can I get there?' People either don't really know how to get the most out of glitching, or overestimate themselves and end up landing in trouble. You don't have that problem.%%%%You have an innate grasp for how to get around with teleporting and any other odd forms of movement you may pick up as if they were entirely natural for you.%%%%You know how many hops, how to time them, how not to 'port yourself into a terrible situation, and how to plan a good route with exotic means.,,
Glitcher - Glitch Grabber,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,All pods have built-in limited glitch capabilities, but now you can teleport things on your own.%%%%You're limited to simply retrieving unattended items that mass about that of an average person within a dozen meters on a strict line-of-sight.%%%%That's not much, but on the other hand you can now stash or retrieve items of the same general size to and from the Cosmic Warehouse. Please do not go crazy with the grenades if you prefer the ship you're on being in one piece.,,
Glitcher - Glitch Tech,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You understand the ins and outs of this universe's teleportation technology. You can build and modify both the handheld versions and the large-scale teleport rooms that link some ships and stations.%%%%Beyond just saving you time on studying, buying this perk teaches you how to make the tech in a way that's non-destructive, so every act of glitching isn't also an act of murder.,,
Offworld Security - Technical Pacificst,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Offworld Security never kills. But there's a lot you can do to someone without killing them, and a few broken fingers is nothing compared to a lost life.%%%%You're a skilled brawler, an even better grappler, and you're an artist at disabling people. Dislocating joints, breaking bones, mashing pressure points and squeezing necks in just the right way, all without causing more damage than necessary.%%%%And as long as you're doing something unpleasant yet temporary for a reasonably good cause you won't hesitate to hurt people or feel at all bad about it afterwards.,,
Offworld Security - Bonk on the Head,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Offworld security never kills. Ever. Mostly. I guess throwing someone out an airlock is fine? Anyways.%%%%When you hit someone, you can decide to exhaust their stamina instead of inflicting injury.%%%%Golf-swing at someone's head or stab them through the heart, and you can render them unconscious with no lasting harm. A tap on the ribs might only tire them out a little, so aim right and swing hard.%%%%This perk doesn't work with big or impersonal methods, like traps and explosives.,,
Offworld Security - Concussive Tech,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Offworld Security might not kill you, but they can make you wish they did. You understand the intricacies of concussive weaponry and energy shields.%%%%Building and modifying these non-lethal weapons, both gun and melee versions in all their variants are easy for you. Shields are a little more tricky.%%%%Personal shields able to tank explosions are uncommon, but wall-to-wall shields to keep the atmosphere from leaking in the event of a hull breach are everywhere. Ship-scale shields are unknown here, but they aren't impossible to research and eventually develop.,,
Foundry - Technical Solutions,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Foundry believes that every societal problem has a technical solution. It seems obvious to say that better radiation shielding will cut down on cancer rates among asteroid miners, but this is more than that.%%%%You have a very good sense of how people and technology interact, knowing how nutrient paste, artificial lighting, and tight corridors affect the health and morale of a station's crew.%%%%Other engineers might talk about energy efficiency or shaving off a few grams of weight, you know how to make the human element fit neatly into your designs on any scale.,,
Foundry - In a Nebula! With a Box of Scraps!,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,There's no denying that the members of the Foundry are very skilled engineers. What sets them apart from others is that they did a lot with very little.%%%%You can bash together things incredibly fast when you need to with improper tools in poor conditions.%%%%The results will be, at best, 'barely good enough' but when you find yourself stranded in an acid nebula it's better than nothing.,,
Foundry - Foundry Tech,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Foundry are naturally the best engineers in the Drift, and have produced devices that are frankly bonkers.%%%%While this perk won't make you a specialist like the other faction tech perks, you will have a broad education in engineering, programming, physics, and some very quirky ideas on how to modify technology.%%%%The foundry created subverters, which can reprogram technology at a distance. And then they made a grenade version that exploded with ‘hack.’ Just because.,,
Sovreign - Run Stab Repeat,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,All Sovereign soldiers have enough training with blades to easily handle someone who tries to brain them with a giant wrench. When guns are involved they just run really, really fast.%%%%You can go from zero to full-tilt in a second, crossing a room and stabbing someone before most guards can even draw a bead on you. Then you can change course and run at the next guy just as fast.,,
Sovreign - Mob Mentality,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sovereign really only cares about profit and will do some very horrible and occasionally dumb things for the sake of the bottom line. Most employees start out as perfectly ordinary people, but being rewarded for ruthless behavior in a cutthroat environment can skew the priorities of all but the most strong-willed people.%%%%You can make people who work under you more impressionable and willing to follow your example. You'll need to prove that your methods produce results, and it will take time depending on how stubborn or idealistic someone is.%%%%I suppose, if you really wanted, that you could encourage your underlings to be better people instead.,,
Sovreign - Sovreign Tech,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,As powerful as Sovereign is as a power bloc, they know the value of discretion.%%%%You're a skillful programmer especially when it comes to cryptography, to both keep people out and crack protected code. This is a skillset in high demand here and an important part of liberating stations from their old owners. On the hardware side you grok how to make things less noisy.%%%%Cold-gas jets and the right silhouette on a pod can vastly reduce your chances of detection, and while it's a little less refined you know how to make personal-scale stealth devices.,,
Melee,,2,,00,,False,,False,,You may begin with your choice of an improbably large pipe wrench, or a long or short blade. It's a matter of preference really, since without perks both can be equally lethal. Seriously, the wrench must be at least the length of a baseball bat and ridiculously heavy.%%%%For 100cp, you can upgrade to a Concussion Hammers or an armor-piercing blade. Despite its looks a concussion hammers is a finely-balanced melee weapon. They augment the force of your swing and let you knock people a dozen meters away, while somehow still being generally nonlethal weapons. Armor-piercing blades are just that, high-tech weapons that can easily slide through all but the thickest sections of the heaviest personal armor suits you'll find in use here%%%%For 200cp you can instead get a copy of Fiasco's Facebreaker, a tonfa that hits like a Concussion Hammer but even faster and harder. It can knock out someone in the heaviest personal armor...and is still, unbelievably, a nonlethal weapon. More murderous types can get a Crashblade, a weapon sheathed in an EM field that lets it cut through personal energy shields as easily as physical armor.,,
Guns,,2,,00,,False,,False,,You can freely start with your choice of weapon type, already modified to be quieter and faster on the reload. Pistols you should know, shotguns fire a spread, and rifles are big two-handed weapons in a cramped ship's halls but are much more accurate. You may choose if your pick of gun is concussive (that is, knocks out instead of kills) or is the usual lethal version.%%%%For 100cp you can upgrade to the full package. Your weapon of choice will be almost completely silent, can switch over to a fully automatic mode, and loads high-powered ammunition (or puts out a higher concussion charge) for penetrating heavy armor. Try not to puncture the hull.%%%%For 200cp you can pick up a unique weapon. The Multiball is a hybrid shotgun/grenade launcher, firing a spread of five microgrenades with an admitted inaccurate spread. The Everything Gun teleports all small objects nearby to it then flings them at your target, only as damaging as the objects at hand. The Fleshstripper is a shotgun that fires a wave of acid, which in this place is the same as killing people with money and firefights can get expensive.,,
Explosives,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,The option that completely lacks subtlety. Besides being just better than most models you'll come across here, this purchase can load both concussive (non-lethal) or explosive (chunky salsa) grenades. Do not confuse the two. Each grenade is launched on a two second timer, detonates on impact, or has a proximity sensor. Your choice.%%%%For an extra 100cp you get a stock of specialized explosives for your launcher. Crash grenades blanket the area with an EM field to shut down electronics while subverter grenades scramble and reprogram local electronics to open locked doors and change the IFF system on turrets..%%%%For an extra 100cp, you get a stash of Arconite grenades. These are more commonly called 'breach grenades' because they will rip holes in a ship's hull and kill anything not protected by energy shields. Arconite explosions are relatively small, but very focused and very intense.,,
Gadgets,,2,,00,,False,,False,,All gadgets purchased with cp are the very best possible for this setting's tech level in both range and capacity. All of them can be recharged/refilled, but for an extra 100cp they will come with an internal power source that continually recharges them at a rate of about a use per minute.,,
Stationeer's Suit,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Considering how often you're going to get thrown into space, by force or by choice, you're going to need this. Comes in a style of your choosing and is quite durable by industrial standards but really can't be called body armor.%%%%These futuristic coveralls will automatically seal themselves up when vacuum is detected, but this is a feature for emergencies and it's not designed for lengthy EVA work. This suit will keep you warm and breathing in space for about a minute, and if you aren't back in your pod by then you have a serious problem.,,
Acid Trap,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Designed to strip away heavy armor so foes can be brought down by conventional weaponry. This trap sprays those who trigger it with an acid that is both highly destructive to armor but harmless to flesh, and somehow extremely subtle. I'm not even going to pretend to understand how that works.%%%%Post-jump, this will severely and discretely weaken all but the most stupidly durable synthetic materials in the targeted area.,,
Key Cloner,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A handy tool that can read the electronic security codes on keycards and security terminals at range and copy them onto a blank keycard for your use.%%%%Post-jump, this device will work on any electronic codes or physical keys you can point it at, creating a temporary duplicate for your use.,,
Multi-Glitcher,,2,,-2000,,False,,False,,Since you're paying cp for it, you'll get an experimental device that can act as a sidewinder, swapper, and visitor combined. Sidewinder mode will teleport you anywhere within range as long as there's an unblocked, man-sized route from your current location. Swapper swaps you with any person or thing of roughly equal size and mass. The visitor teleports you to any location within range, and then immediately yanks you back after two seconds have elapsed.,,
Combo Crashbeam,,2,,-2000,,False,,False,,Another multipupose device, this will either shut down or sabotage electronic systems. Sometimes you want a sentry turret shut down, and sometimes you want it shooting at everyone that isn't you. Pop a personal shield bubble or make it reflect bullets that are fired from the inside.,,
Slipstream,,2,,-3000,,False,,False,,Seriously, using these things feels like cheating. This gadget wraps you in a bubble of accelerated time, giving you ten seconds to act where everyone else gets only one. You can still interact (violently) with the world and use other gadgets normally during this time, but this gadget's field doesn't extend beyond yourself and whatever you’re holding.%%%%Be mindful when trying to interact with anything the field can’t envelop.,,
Armour,,2,,-3000,,False,,False,,Mil-spec armor rarely seen outside of the most heavily-defended ships and stations, basic weaponry won’t be getting through this at all. Only specialized armor-piercing blades and ammunition will do anything to this. Explosives also work.%%%%The better-equipped crews will be carrying things that can threaten you, but some ships might not be able to handle you at all. Don’t get cocky wearing this, the enemy has gadgets and can get creative too when needed.,,
Shield,,2,,-4000,,False,,False,,A powerful, personal energy shield capable of resisting damn near any kind of weapon, killing someone with a shield requires gadgets or getting creative.%%%%If you don’t belong on the ship you’re moving through, you won’t benefit from the wireless energy transfer needed to keep this shield up for more than a few seconds at a time.,,
Contractor Gear,,2,,-4000,,False,,False,,Defenders, jammers, trackers and predators are some of the most annoying foes you’ll have to deal with. Purchasing this gives you the unique gear carried by one of them.%%%%Defenders can shield nearby allies, and until the defender is brought down those secondary shields can’t be disabled in any way.%%%%Jammers lay down devices that prevent enemy gadgets and glitching from functioning properly.%%%%Tracker sensors can penetrate stealth tech and follow an intruder’s path perfectly.%%%%Predators have highly accurate short-range sensors combined with unique glitch tech that allows them to detect enemies, teleport and attack in almost the same instant.,,
Pods,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Faction loyalists receive their faction's pod for free. The faction pods are also of a much higher all-around quality than the independent's kitbashed breacher pods.,,
Breacher Pod,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Breacher pods are the infiltrator's tool of choice for sneaking onto other ships. They're small and have zero combat capabilities, but have a few self-repair systems and redundancies to help you limp back to a station in an emergency. All pods have a built-in glitch system that can teleport small items to/from storage, and a basic AI that will attempt to keep the pod hidden or retrieve you if it detects someone at the airlock or you floating in space.,,
Foundry Brick,,2,,-3000,,False,,False,,As ugly as its namesake, the brick doesn't need an airlock to get someone on board an enemy ship. It's durable enough to simply slam into the hull, latch on, and cut a new door into the hull. It's really not at all subtle, but for some missions and some operatives it's a perfect fit.,,
Offworld Angel,,2,,-3000,,False,,False,,A sleek and comfortable craft, the angel has two very useful features. Firstly, the pod has an autodoc that can treat lesser injuries and stabilize the seriously wounded for proper attention later. Secondly, there's a tractor system used for the easy retrieval of people who get tossed into space. You'll probably be using both of these things a lot.,,
Sovreign Coldfire,,2,,-3000,,False,,False,,A pod designed to be even more stealthy than usual, thanks to the unique shape and composition of its hull plating. In addition the coldfire sports a secondary cold-gas propulsion system that puts out negligible amounts of heat and EM disruptions, making it practically invisible to the average ship's sensors. Manoeuvrability and top speed suffers compared to the normal drive, so get some practice in first.,,
Glitcher Tick,,2,,-3000,,False,,False,,Equipped with a very precise short-ranged glitch drive, this pod can make small stealthy hops with only a short recharge time. The onboard glitch systems are naturally more robust, and can retrieve, but not send, objects as large as a person if you can provide specific targeting data.,,
Import,,3,,00,,False,,False,,For 100cp, you can import a single companion. They must have the same background as you, and they have 600cp to spend. Every extra 100cp you spend doubles the number of imports. 200cp for two, 300 for four, 400 for eight.,,
Sader Fiasco,,3,,-4000,,False,,True,,There are old spies, and there are bold spies, but no old, bold spies. Except for Fiasco. A legend in the Drift, Fiasco is already responsible for the annihilation of a fifth faction in the Drift after they killed someone she cared about. More than sixty years old and feeling her age (and all the bullet wounds) she currently prefers to leave the physical work to the rest of the revolutionaries while she handles intelligence work.%%%%Impressing her won't be easy. If you can manage that she'd be willing to accompany you on your journey.%%%%That her enemies can't follow may be a small factor in the decision. Sader has all the perks of the 'Independent' background, her signature weapon, and a lifetime of experience making terrible mistakes and thinking of clever ways out of them.,,
Defector Missions,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You must complete each station's defector mission by the end of ten years, or you will fail the jump.%%%%Why is this drawback only worth +100cp? Because just as in the game, you may redo these missions as many times as you like with no penalty for failure or death.%%%%Some are easy, some are very hard, and some are just gimmicky. You won't be able to gain anything from these missions but the memory of living another person's life for a short time, but at least it's good, safe practice. Except for that one where you need to board a ship without a pod by propelling yourself through space with a shotgun. That one's no fun.,,
Vow,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You personally uphold one of two vows: To never kill anyone, or to never be seen on a mission. You'll feel terrible for breaking your vow, out of regret, professionalism, or some other reason, and be compelled to atone in some way. How you deal with it won't take too long or be too self-destructive, but you'll feel terrible about it for a short time afterwards.,,
Negative Trait,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You have one or more negative character traits that player characters can be generated with, except for 'Dying.'%%%%You may take this drawback up to three times.,,
Mission Clause,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Every mission you go on will have at least one clause, such as 'Do not be seen' or 'Do not harm anyone except your target.' If you breach this clause you can expect a serious pay cut and complications will arise that means more problems for you later down the line.,,
Were is all the Loot?,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Some ships carry specialized equipment in chests that the guards never make use of, and contractors carry some pretty impressive gadgets. But now you'll never find loot lying around.%%%%What you take off the guards will either be common as dirt or black-boxed and unusable for you.%%%%Everything you use will have to be purchased or personally crafted.,,
Serious Guard Kit,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The four factions are now splurging on internal security considering how often their ships are invaded and hijacked. You can count on every single guard aboard the ships you invade to have at least one piece of special equipment. A gadget, heavy weapons, armor, personal shields, etc. Senior officers will have at least two, and the crew of the important vessels like siege ships will have all of them. For everyone.,,
Getting Creative,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You have a strong compulsion to complete your missions in complex and stylish ways. Why go with the old 'slipstream and concussion hammer' routine every room when you could run into a room with a sentry gun, swap places with a guy just after the sentry gun fires at you, hack the sentry gun so it shoots a second guy, and then shoot out the window so the third guy gets sucked into space while you glitch into the room next door and steal the gadget you came for? It's more fun that way!,,
Jammer Fields,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Even if a contractor is not on board, all ships will have important areas such as the cockpit or brig protected by a jamming field. Most ships will have partial coverage on other areas as well Your various gadgets will not work within the field, and trying to glitch (teleport) into or out of the field is a very bad idea. On the upside, if you can find the jamming device it's a simple matter to destroy it and bring down that section of the field.,,
Proximity Sensors,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Ships are now flying with upgraded external security. You'll need to be more careful on the approach, keeping thruster use to a minimum, or using tactics like flying in the ship's engine wake to hide your approach. If you're detected, expect to either be fired upon or find a squad of guards waiting for you at the airlock. Probably both.,,
What a Fiasco,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Normally, Sader Fiasco will provide you with missions and the intel you need to carry them out. But she's a very busy woman and now there's little to no information she can provide you with to make your job easier. At most, she can tell you if you're going into an active warzone where ships are shooting at each other or how difficult a mission will likely be on the Easy-Medium-Hard-Audacious-Mistake scale.%%%%You'll be going into your missions blind, so be prepared for anything.,,
A Mistake,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Every mission you go on will be much more difficult. Expect lots of highly-trained guards, sentry guns everywhere and hair-trigger alarms. If you took drawbacks like 'Jammer fields' then expect them to be cranked up to eleven, with multiple overlapping fields or hardened emitters that need explosives to crack open. Success or failure depends on a very slim margin for error,,
Powerless,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,The standard power loss drawback. No out-of-jump powers, no cosmic warehouse. You can't take this drawback if this is your first jump.,,
It's Personal,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Five years into this jump, something will happen. It won't be about freedom or hegemony. This will be personal. Someone you care about will be hurt, or kidnapped, or you'll be in desperate need of something you can't get anywhere else. This will be an extremely difficult mission, and there will be painful consequences that you'll acutely feel for the rest of your time here if you fail.,,
Liberation or Conquest,,5,,00,,False,,True,,By taking this scenario the jump becomes a gauntlet. You'll begin with 0cp (you can't take the 'Powerless' drawback) and death won't end your chain, only deprive you of anything you purchased or collected from this jump. Naturally, you have no out-of-jump powers and no cosmic warehouse, only bodymod to help you out.%%%%You must either liberate (as an Independent) or conquer (as a loyalist) the Drift. This means, at minimum, capturing at least half of the stations controlled by each of the four factions and their headquarters. If you're a loyalist, you must defeat the other three factions as well as stomp out the growing revolutionary movement. Sadler is a fearsome foe and she'll make things very difficult for you. Capturing her is an extremely daunting prospect, and if you can't take her out of play then after a tipping point it'll seem like she'll care less about stopping you and more about making the victory costly for your faction, especially in terms of fleet capability...%%%%Your reward for this accomplishment is the Drift itself, attached to your warehouse. A sizable nebula about a single AU in diameter, composed of horrifically corrosive acid, exotic compounds, metal-rich asteroids and vast amounts of valuable minerals already dissolved within the cloud. With the right technology to extract and process it, the Drift's value is staggering. There is a single station, a copy of Coldrock Haven for Independents or your faction's headquarters for loyalists, floating within the Drift and stocked with automated mining technology. By itself it might take decades, but with enough time you could slowly consume the entire Drift’s resources.%%%%And the best part? Once per jump, you may push a button to reset things and get a fresh nebula to begin harvesting all over again. I suppose you could fill this section of space with stuff instead if you wanted to build something really big inside, but be careful when you hit the big red button. Anything not inside the station (which retains internal changes and upgrades) will be destroyed and lost when the space is reset.,,
