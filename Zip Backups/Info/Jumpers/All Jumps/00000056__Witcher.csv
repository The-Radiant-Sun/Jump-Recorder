Elf,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Elves? are one of the humanoid ?races? that inhabit the ?Continent?. Forming a major part of the Elder Races? (along with ?dwarves? and ?gnomes?), those known as ?Aen Seidhe came to the Continent on their white ships much earlier than humans, but later than the other Elder Races.%%%%They live much longer than humans and are usually very attractive.%%%%Elves are capable of interbreeding with humans (thus producing? half-elves? and? quadroons?) and dryads?. Though elves are incredibly long lived, only young elves are fertile, thus elven populations tend to reproduce at a slower rate than humans. Like other? non-humans?, elves are often persecuted by? Nordlings?. Because of that, many elves were members of the? Scoia'tael? guerillas allied with? Nilfgaard? during the empire's invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. In return, Emperor? Emhyr var Emreis? gave the elves a state of their own in? Dol Blathanna? and made? Enid an Gleanna? its queen.%%%%Elves believe that they were created, unlike humans, who evolved. For this reason, some elves consider humans to be little more than hairless apes. Aside from Aen Seidhe, there exists another group of elves called? ?Aen Elle that inhabits another world.,,
Dwarf,,0,,-500,,False,,False,,Dwarves? are one of the humanoid? races?. Together with? gnomes? and? elves? they are called the? Old races?, and along with gnomes they were one of the oldest sentient races on the? Continent?.%%%%An adult dwarf grows as tall as a? human? male's chest. They are more sturdy than humans, which makes them tougher and stronger. They usually grow long beards.%%%%Dwarves are often excellent soldiers, artisans and businessmen. While they tend to be uncouth, they are also jolly and cheerful. The motherland of dwarves is? Mahakam?.%%%%Like other? nonhumans?, dwarves are often persecuted by? Nordlings?. Because of that, some dwarves were members of the? Scoia'tael? guerrilla allied with? Nilfgaard? during the empire's invasion of the? Northern Kingdoms?. These dwarves distinguished themselves from their brethren by wearing their beards in plaits.,,
Gnome,,0,,-500,,False,,False,,Gnomes? are one of the humanoid? races?. Gnomes were the oldest sentient race on the? Continent and together with? dwarves? and? elves? are called the? Old races?.%%%%Gnomes are shorter and weaker than dwarves, but just as tough and more agile. They can be easily distinguished from dwarves and? halflings? by their long noses.%%%%Many gnomes live in? Mahakam? along with the dwarves, although others inhabit the? Tir Tochair? mountain range.%%%%They are excellent smiths and metallurgists and their? gwyhyr? swords are considered the best in the world.,,
Human,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Humans are the dominant racial group on the ?Continent?, forming the majority of inhabitants in both the ?Northern Kingdoms? and the? Empire of Nilfgaard?.%%%%When humans first arrived on the already-populated Continent, they quickly set about conquering the lands already inhabited by? elder races?. The humans thus established themselves as the dominant race and so elves?,? dwarves?,? gnomes? and? halflings? are now generally referred to as? nonhumans?. Hailing from a destroyed world, humans first appeared in this world after the ?Conjunction of the Spheres?. The? Dauk? and ?Wozgor? peoples settled on the Continent at some time before the Nordling? culture. Scholars speculate that the Empire's native ?inhabitants? hail from a human culture predating those dominant in the North.%%%%Humans and elves are not terribly dissimilar in appearance. Roughly sharing a similar size, elves have pointed ears, smaller teeth and tend to be more delicately featured. Humans also do not live as long (by far) as elves.%%%%The humans are at war with elves in particular and have a rather poor relationship with the dwarves, halflings and gnomes. The races do live together in the cities, however the non-humans are forced to pay a levy just for being non-humans. Several? pogroms? have taken place in the cities. Many of the larger human cities were? built on the ruins? of elven cities which the humans had burned down; cities like? Vizima? and? Novigrad?, to name only two.,,

Monster - Cyclops,,0,,-500,,False,,True,,You have become a cyclops jumper. Immense humanoids standing at least 12 feet tall , with only a single eye.%%%%The only that matches your immensely superhuman strength and durability is your hatred of humanity.,,

You are naturally able to render yourself invisible, hypnotize both men and beasts with a thought, while you also do not set off even the magic sensitive medallions of a Witcher when in their presence.%%%%Unlike the vampires of myth and legend you are immune to daylight, holy symbols , silver, and garlic, it requires more than that to defeat you.

Livelihood - Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are an unknown walking through these lands, with no memories or knowledge to guide you through these lands...hopefully you’ll quickly learn how to behave during your time here.,,
Livelihood - Commoner,,0,,-500,,False,,False,,You are the medieval commoner, part of faceless masses who have always was a source of heroes or villains whose fame surpass that of others. Lucky peasant, cunning citizen, brave soldier, cruel bandit, or wise scholar or who knows who, maybe all of this and something else for you have something what others lack - all roads of life open to you, all chances in you reach go and make a name for yourself.,,
Livelihood - Noble,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,You were born with taste of power as blue blooded aristocrat, or may be gained noble title recently by strength of arms or golden price, this not important. What’s important is that you are above mere commoners and have many rights in this world, as well as noble obligations. Play your card right and who knows, maybe you will be next ruler.,,
Livelihood - Witcher,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,A ?witcher? is someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical conditioning, and mysterious rituals (which take place at "witcher schools" such as? Kaer Morhen?) in preparation for becoming an itinerant? monsterslayer? for hire.,,
Livelihood - Sorcerer,,0,,-4000,,False,,True,,Congratulations! You have a talent which set you apart from common folk, something what no riches can buy - natural ability to harness primordial energy and wield great power of magic. Some may dislike and fear you, but only fools will voice that opinion to person who can kill them with just a thought. Unfortunately, it come with attached price - your chance to have a child is...slim at best.,,
Woodscraft,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You have skills in almost anything that pertains to the? woods? or forest, especially in making one's way through the? woods? or in hunting, trapping, etc. Expect to be more than capable of making your way through environments that may be especially hostile, so if you’ve got a Monster or some other manner of beast lurking around you’ll be sure to know long before it catches your scent.,,
Weapons Training,,1,,00,,False,,True,,It’s a time when no one can feel themselves too safe from dangers of the word, be it some monster or, much more likely, robbers on the road. So most of people know how to handle different weapons, at least on some basic level. Now you also have such skills, being above average but not a master yet. Be wary; while you can take on a bandit or two travelling right into an ambush is a sure way to die. And for monsters... just call a witcher for help.,,
Horsemanship,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Unlike what video games may tell you horses are not medieval cars, riding all day at maximum speed and putting them the in the  stable is a good way to lose your steed and they cost a lot, sometimes so much so that your own life is cheaper. However, you’ll now find that possess the skills to care for and ride these magnificent beasts, and somehow being capable of always taking care of them, even if at bare minimum.,,
Of the Elder Blood,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,It appears that you are an unaccounted for relative of Ciri, by way of Laura Dorren, being an active carrier of the Elder Blood, as it seems that you can travel in the local multiverse; from shifting through time and space to crossing through worlds like stepping through a door, though your control over your ability is rather crude and in dire need of training before it becomes useful.%%%%But be wary, refining such a gift is a dangerous process, for the worlds are filled not just with wonders but horrors as well - how else do you think the monsters that witchers hunt appeared, other than when the worlds collided long ago?%%%%%%Capstone Booser,,
Nutrition,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Drop In%%%%In these times famine is a real danger and many people spend long exhausting time at work just to keep themselves fed. Food is bland for the poor, and what they eat depends on the time of the year and their location. Only the rich and powerful can allow themselves diversity and delicacies like catoblepas meat. Before you start to rage at the world for lacking fast food chains know that now that while you may not enjoy taste of your food it is much more filling for you, as you need very little to sustain yourself.%%%%Only one or two good meals a week will suffice for a balanced diet for your person.%%%%Though do your best not to unveil this before others, as many starve on what keeps you thriving.,,
Lore Mastery,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Drop In%%%%You possess an adaptive understanding of most customs, with only the most obscure or alternative eluding your grasp without sufficient knowledge. While it’s not a big loss if you don’t take this, it would be all too sad for you to lose your head only because you forgot to bow to a king, or being burned at stake for asking a priest for a buff, or being beaten by local dryads for dirty jokes. Thankfully you now have a little bit of local common sense: knowledge of customs and traditions, an overview of history, and an understanding of how to act without provoking the locals.,,
Law of Surprise,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Drop In%%%%Your existence binds a tight knot in an already confusing and tangled weave of destiny. Gods of fate may not be smiling upon you, but they feel too entertained at your antics to get rid of you now so until you do something monumentally stupid or suicidal you will not die from such banal things as the blade of an assassin or a cup of poison, you could come through wars nearly unscratched. Even in battle you can somehow survive, probably by bumbling around, while your companions take care of enemy.%%%%Additionally you have great luck in games of chance and, unless you want to lose, you almost always win. Do try not to play games with long winning streaks in the same place or the losers may suspect something.,,
Source,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Drop In%%300 CP for Monser%%%%You are consumed by the feeling of becoming a fountaining source for raw magical energies. Beings like you are not something truly unknown, though you are incredibly rare, as a certain white-haired girl lost in shifting sand dunes of Korath desert can attest. Your alien nature helps you contain these terrible energies; stressful situations don't trigger strange effects, and despite your gift still being difficult to control you have a firm hold over its power so madness will not seep into your mind (unlike a certain boy tortured by visions of hungry cold).%%%%This gives you great aptitude for magic, though you are likely to require education in this discipline to truly succeed. This makes you your own source of energy, giving you freedom from dependence on outside elements. Your ability as Source will grow with your general magical power, rapidly refilling your reserves of magical energy in an hour from empty regardless of their size.%%%%If you are what the “civilized” races in their ignorance describe as a “monster” you still enjoy all benefits described above, even if the regeneration of your magic is lesser in degree, taking you twice as long to regenerate your magical reserves as a non-monstrous source, and you also enjoy great physical augmentation.%%%%This is because as a descendant of the beings that appeared and were trapped in this world at the time of the Conjunction of the Spheres you have incredibly strange biology, letting magical energies of the Source infuse your body and all natural abilities, making you so much more powerful than the rest of your kin.%%%%It is undoubted that you are an apex specimen of your species, looked upon with awe and fear by your kin, and simple terror from all others. You are someone who is capable of single-handedly laying waste to cities and armies through power of might and magic. It would be incredibly difficult for you to you not return from such battles unharmed. While you might still meet your end from the blade or spell of brave, strong or lucky heroes you are capable of great destruction.%%%%If you seek infamy and don’t hide yourself you should expect fools to come seeking to claim your life for many pointless reasons.%%%%%%Capstone Booster:%%For an infinitely small fraction of a flickering moment, the multicolored mosaic of reality were shattered into countless pieces and rearranged to accommodate the pure impossibility of your existence, normalizing you, molding you into your current form so worlds can continue their seemingly endless drift into incomprehensible unknown without falling apart. A singular fact of this event is that you were not left unchanged by it... or were you merely awakened from long blissful dream keeping you in the pleasant comfort of reliable boundaries? For now, the answer eludes you.%%%%At a base this doubles your rate of magical regeneration. What’s clear is that you are a being of unlimited possibilities, strange laws of constantly changing kaleidoscopes of myriad dimensions, and touches of cosmic infinitudes giving +you the raw potential to be more that you are now, and when you reach your perceived limits, you understand that they nothing but fragile illusion, vanquished by you approach, for you are always can be more. You may be not the most skilled, uniquely talented or notably effective, perhaps even opposite this, but you eventually surpass others with your potential for limitless growth.,,
Trade Skill,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Commoner%%%%You possess the knowledge of any one late medieval skill, with a minor reputation boost in regards toward your mastery of it, that of a journeyman. Have you considered Blacksmithing or Masonry? %%%%You have the training of a tradesman, being of at least journeyman skill in whatever trade you pick. This would allow you to be successful in your trade in the level needed for a town or a village, but insufficient for a larger city with a resident master.%%%%Each Trade you choose must be an appropriate medieval trade (tanner, potter, brewer, hunter, blacksmith, scribe, etc...).%%%%Along with skill in a trade each trade comes with the knowledge of an appropriate additional language (both spoken and written). For example: allowing a blacksmith to speak gnomish or dwarven, a brewer to speak Nilfgaardian, a hunter to speak Dryad, a Scribe to speak the One Speech/Elder Speech.,,
Apprenticeship,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Commoner%%%%It's not as bad as you thought it would be, learning your craft under a skilled Master. At first it was difficult but after some practice, you’ve found it to be not that difficult at all. In fact, it does not take nearly as much effort to complete the tasks you’re Master is providing you with, with you discovering that you can excel under their tutelage, learning thrice as fast as you would have without their tutelage.%%%%For some reason your Master and other Apprentices do not feel jealous of you, they’ll even encourage you efforts and share their own little tricks of the trade. Even if you were to change profession, you would find that your teacher is always very competent and helpful. It’s a golden time in your life, just remember not to flirt with your Master’s only daughter too openly, I don’t care that she’s probably prettiest girl in the kingdoms...,,
Three Dog Night,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Commoner%%%%This is a strange era - one where scholars and sorcerers know the secrets of biology and genetics. At the same time the common folk have no idea of highbrow terminology, believing that all is the will of the gods and prayer can heal them from all diseases... while at the same time forgetting to wipe their hands from manure before eating.%%%%Whatever it is, for some reason, you are special. By a quirk of your immune system or honest divine oversight no natural disease ever touches you. Supernatural diseases are still somewhat dangerous but even then you have an unnatural resistance to them.%%%%A magical virus that could kill others in seconds would be no worse than common cold for you. Yes, I know what you have on your mind, this means that you need not ever fear STDs.,,
Mastercraft,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Gnomes%%300 CP for Drop In%%300 CP for Commoner%%%%What separates a Master from an Apprentice? No, not the fact that the current Master married his teacher's only daughter and inherited his position in the guild. A ?True Master of his craft is person whose work is akin to art. Perhaps even the Art snobbish sorcerers like to call their magic, because when someone looks at what was made by your hand they cannot believe it is not magic.%%%%When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it. Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make. This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don’t suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business.%%%%Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are. They may not be able to surpass you but your legacy will live on through them and their work, and the work of their students and beyond, forever immortalizing your name.%%%%Even if history may not remember your other deeds expect to become a folklore hero in the future.%%%%Oh, and good news to you who are Gnomes! You are now also a master metallurgist and have mastered the art of Gwyhyr blades, which are known to be among the greatest weapons ever forged on the continent, with each blade being a masterful work of art.%%%%For an extra 100 CP those unfortunate enough not to be Gnomish may also gain this understanding of their metallurgy and metalworks.%%%%%%Capstone Booster:%%Now you cannot say that your work is not? magic, because it is. On some fundamental level, any item you crafted or art piece you create will become legendary artifacts of an unmatched strength, a song will touch the very souls of listeners, resonating through the ages, and even food is something unearthly beautiful capable of feeding entire army.%%%%Even your failures will be something beyond work of mortals, like this sword you made while being drunk and then for some reason stabbed into stone near a lake with it. Someone stole it not so long ago by the way, you suspect some knight and a white-haired girl.%%%%Many other wonders await to be born from your work, which can only become better and better, for you know that there is no perfection, only the path to it, so your mastery grows without limits, maybe in one day the sheer excellency of your work will even surpass perfection itself. It astonishing that you can do all of this even with most basic instruments and materials, at fraction of time, perhaps the materials bend to your will while you work? Forget about becoming folk hero, you are now a craftsmen of mythical proportions. Don’t be surprised when people name you as famous saint, or even god, of your profession.,,
Bard,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Noble%%%%At courts of kings lies and blood flow alike. With the talent to charmingly weave words in pleasant flatteries and convincing half-truths, mask taunts as innocent remarks and make fun of brutish opponent you can be considered one of the most interesting courtiers. Why duel with sharp sticks when you can destroy your opponent with your no less sharp wit?%%%%This talent also gives a great affinity and natural skill for poetry, music, singing, and - as many beauties can confirm - something else, which while not openly spoken of in higher society can only increase your popularity. Try to be careful in your conquests, otherwise the crowd of angry husbands will become quite inconvenient.,,
Noble Bearings,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Noble%%%%Your education was amongst the best in the land. You have an innate knowledge of noble “world“ customs, which updates in subsequent worlds.%%%%If you continue to use the appropriate courtly manners and proper etiquette in the future you will find that your reputation with the natives of the world is boosted slightly beyond what it naturally would be.,,
Motivations,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Noble%%%%Most people believe that they’ve got a good grasp on what motivates people and those truly masterful of the art will say there is nothing that they cannot grasp.%%%%You are beyond their paltry skill and can say with ?absolute certainty that you understand what it’s like to ?be in another person’s shoes, understanding the ins and outs of their being... or at least you’ll eventually be capable of doing so. In your current state you’ll be at most capable of telling whether or not that fella there that you call a friend has truly got your back, along with what might be going on with that shifty dude behind you.%%%%With enough practice, you’ll be capable of applying this skill to large groups of people: entire communities, armies, nations, etc.,,
Title Owner,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Noble%%300 CP for Human%%%%While before you may have possessed some minor noble title you now possess the rank, title and lands equal to that of a Duke, which updates with each and every world that you will travel to. Choose your family ?wisely as in addition to now being a Duke you now also possess the Royal Blood of your kingdom. Though you are sadly outside of the ?direct line of succession.%%%%As a sign of such an upbringing you exhume more charisma and persuasiveness than your average noble, enough so that even a commoner could be capable of building an empire upon their sheer cult of personality. Also, as part of royal family you also have been extensively trained in the skills needed to come out on top in most sorts of political, secret or underhanded schemes that you may eventually become involved in.%%%%It is such that some have suggested that you could overthrow the king with ease. Though, as some know, there ?is power in being unknown...%%%%%%Capstone Booster:%%You are elevated to the station of royal blood, making you part of the royal bloodline of Cintra and younger sibling of Cirilla, making you an anomaly unaccounted for in the great prophecy. You’ll find that besides being capable of wielding greater influence over those who can be called your subjects, that in each and every subsequent world that you discover yourself within, you will be tied to the royalty of your people and be awarded with a portion of the family’s abilities and talents. Not only giving you the respect, responsibility and privilege that being royalts entails but being able to truly use the talents of your family. Surely there must be reason for their rule, and perhaps it is immense charisma, allowing you to also gain that boon.%%%%The skills and talents of your family could be anything relevant in setting from respect, to immense skill in politics, to a special and rare bloodline power that your family has, maybe you are descended from Dragons and can control them, or something else. Regardless of what it is, you will find yourself bound into the legacies and strength of your family, thereby being granted a legitimate claim on the throne, being a duke or a prince that is out of the line of succession, should the worst come to pass. This perk makes you a noble of royal blood who is outside of the line of succession. This means that if you want to rule, the current ruler and direct heir must be either wildly incompetent or gone for you to have any direct claim.,,
Signs,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Witcher%%%%One of the most useful tools in a Witcher’s arsenal is the bastardized form of magic known as Signs. These simple spells can be used with one hand and require little knowledge about magical theory to use. There are a variety of Signs with various powers andou know all of them, though you start out with only a basic level of skill with them.%%%%With practise you may be able to improve their power and duration. If you also understand how to utilize magical spells you may become able to alter these spells into new signs, though they retain their relative simplicity and cost.,,
Monster Lore,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,100 CP for Witcher%%%%While you may not be a monster you certainly know all about them. More than that however you are constantly learning and discovering new traits about the monsters that you hunt.%%%%Not only are you blessed with luck in overhearing or being told about the local myths and legends regarding monsters but you have a knack for figuring out the nuggets of truth hidden in the story. If a monster requires the sacrifice of a human woman once every thirty years you would be able to infer why that sacrifice was needed. Whether it be for consumption, magic, mating or any other reason you can get to the heart of the matter.%%%%While listening to the lore is all well and good should you ever come face to face with a monster this knack carries through giving insight into why it acts and behaves in the manner that it does. This insight works for any magical creature that you face or anything considered to be a monster or monstrous by a local population.%%%%Post-Jump this perk works for the monsters and magical creatures inherent to the setting, it does however remain contingent on hearing the local myths and legends or coming face to face with the creature in question.,,
Alchemical Knowledge,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,200 CP for Witcher%%%%Alchemy is a key part of a Witcher’s toolset; witchers are masters of crafting not only potions to further enhance their superhuman abilities but also bombs, weapon oils and other chemical contraptions. In future worlds you will be just as capable at creating analogies of these mixtures as you are at creating those found within this world.%%%%Just remember that certain alchemical creations are ?not for the consumption of the standard populace. Who knows if that poor woman will be cured of her ailment by the use of a witcher’s brew; she might get better, or ?much worse.,,
Trial of the Grasses,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Witcher%%%%You have participated in the Trial of the Grasses. While you have not emerged unchanged you have gained a great deal.%%%%You have become stronger, faster; better equipped to face the horrors and monster what lurk in the dark. You are the epitome of what it means to be a witcher. It is a rare monster that can match your might and prove your equal. The protector of humanity from evil big and small. As a you have undergone the trial of the Grasses you have gained several superhuman gifts, however like with certain gifts they come at a cost. The cost for a witcher being physical mutations and sterility. (This sterility is permanent only for this jump, unless you’d prefer to keep it.)%%%%As a witcher you have gained catlike eyes that are able to see perfectly in a situation from pitch darkness to blinding light, a tremendous resistance to poison and toxins, functional immunity to mundane diseases and superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and endurance. Your physical abilities are augmented to the point that a normal man who had undergone this process would be able to overpower and kill all but the strongest monsters one on one with nothing more than a sword in hand.

Basic Mastery,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Sorcerer%%%%Sorcerers use the energy of the four elements for their spells.

Good news that if you will be kissed this curse will be lifted from you, bad news that it can’t be your Companions, but person of your preferred gender with genuine love for you, so no overt manipulations, no lies, no enthralling, or other way of twisting minds, but honest feeling.%%%%While you wait for such miracle to happen, enjoy frequent visits of random people with goals to kill you, be it mob of peasant blaming you for crop failure and the birth of two-headed calves, city militia thrown into suicide mission by their officers for hiding their share of bribes, naïve knights send by their relatives so they can seize estate of fools and many others.%%%%Not everyone will be hostile, some people can be pretty nice and understanding of your situation, certain scholars, sorcerers and witchers even may try to help you if you don’t alienate them, thought, not many will listen to them...%%%%Good luck and I hope you like taste of flies.,,
Racial Tensions,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,It appears that the oppressed races of the Continent have had enough, and have begun to once more mass their resources together in another offensive to repel, and among the most extreme, eject the occupying human populations.%%%%Soon, tensions on the Continent are to erupt in an all out Rebellion and possibly even Civil War, eventually leaving the victor dissatisfied with pyrrhic victory and millions dead.%%%%However, all of these events are a ways off and may possibly never happen, as, hopefully, this means that you are with the means of ending the upcoming conflict peacefully, with everybody reasonably satisfied; should you try to avoid this by way of your Race and/Livelihood, be warned that you shall be of obvious mixed heritage, with events conspiring to have you ?directly involved.,,
War is On the Horizon,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,In the upcoming wars to come, you’ll find that you need to find and choose a side/nation to champion. Be warned, your enemy will be vastly superior in terms of either manpower, tactics and strategy, technology, resources, etc. (yes, even if you should have chosen Nilfgaard), and that the longer this conflict draws on, the greater your enemy shall become (in terms of technology).%%%%Should you have taken this with ‘?Racial Tensions?’, the upcoming conflict will devolve into essentially a world war (equivalent with WWII), a war that none of the nations are currently prepared for; save Redania, its war machine more terrible than any this world has yet seen, hellbent on removing the “unpure“ from their lands.%%%%If you fail in your combined task (?RT? + WiotH?), you shall fail in your journey here and be returned Home.,,
The White Frost,,5,,10000,,False,,True,,The White Frost is a phenomenon that results in the freezing of entire planets. While the most powerful magics may seemingly slow its pace on a regional level, it is widely understood to be an inevitable end of all worlds. Whether this is the result of a natural force, a malevolent entity, or an entirely different cause is not revealed.%%%%The end of the world approaches, and while once this was to be another's fight, however, by you having taken this drawback you are forced to fight alongside her... or gods forbid, in her place...to end the threat of the White Frost, and dear child, the threat is far more imminent than what was projected for now, the Frosts have begun to nip at the gates of this world and you must hold the line, for the end of all things is near...%%%%If you have somehow managed to overcome this phenomena, you’ll find yourself with power over the White Frost itself and capable of Absolute Thermokinesis besides, though it will take you some time to acclimate to this power, and its full potential cannot be harnessed until you acquire your own Spark.%%%%But should you fail, there are some dire consequences indeed for your actions, or lack thereof, as the White Frost will begin to use you as its conduit to freeze and destroy the various worlds you have visited in your Jumpchain... perhaps it might be best to leave this in Ciri’s hands if you aren’t that confident then, huh?,,
