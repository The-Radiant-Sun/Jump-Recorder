Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Superhero? Ha! You're just an ordinary person trying to make a living. And in this crazy world, that's harder and more respectable than being a costumed freak, for sure.%%%%Nobody knows nor really cares where you came from, but you still quickly find a mundane job that will pay the bills. Between all this talk of war and chaos, you at least won't have to worry about that.,,
Cape,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Following the trend of putting on a funny costume to go beat up criminals, you've become a proper superhero! Well, you may not have powers outside of what your previous adventures have left you, but you can still take on the occasional criminal or two.%%%%Depending on the era you've chosen, you may already have retired to settle into a peaceful, if slightly boring ordinary life. As for your secret identity, it's up to you: either you retired without making a fuss and revealing it, remaining in the public consciousness as a figure of mystery and rumors; or you did unmask for the cameras and have a slightly more trustworthy reputation.,,
Cowl,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This vigilantism business isn't just a hobby to you, and you approach it with the ruthlessness required for the job and none of the naive idealism from the funny papers.%%%%If the government ever gets around to banning the practice, you'll just keep going, with their tacit approval or not.%%%%Superheroics aren't exactly popular among the general population (and, with that background, you might have something to do with that) so, uh, don't expect a movie deal any time soon.,,
World's Smartest,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,The expression might just be your PR team trying to one-up Adrian Veidt, but nobody can deny that you're brilliant, nor that you've made good use of that intelligence, contributing to the war for law and order with all the flair and skill of a rich genius.%%%%Still, you've already realized the limitations of your crime-fighting ways. Maybe you've even already started seeking alternatives. Thankfully, your real superpower is in how well you've succeeded in areas completely divorced from crime-fighting, gathering resources and influence, so you'll have more options to choose from than your clueless colleagues.,,
Post Human,,0,,-4000,,False,,True,,Turns out the Doc isn't the only superhuman after all. Through some poorly understood freak accident, you've yourself become something entirely different from plain old humanity, the most visible sign being that you emit a constant bright glow, do not seem to have much left in the way of biological needs, and have started developing proper superpowers. This counts as an altform, under which you do not age.%%%%While some commentators have started speculating that you and Manhattan make up the vanguard of a new, transcendent humanity, you seem completely incapable of replicating the circumstances that led to your transformation. Maybe once you get your Spark?,,
Fearful Symmetry,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Everything around you just seems to be bursting with callbacks, visuals and cultural references, giving seemingly greater weight to what is going on around you. This cosmetic perk can give you some measure of insight into your current situation, if you ever decide to pay attention to the small details.%%%%At the end of your Jump, you may also take the pulpy, saturated look of Watchmen along with you as an option to toggle on and off. Either way, nobody else will really notice.,,
Drop In - Small World,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,This world out there is strange, with antics more suited to comic books having suddenly jumped right into the newspapers pages. Better keep reading, then. You seem to always have read or watched the latest news as they appear, and you have effortlessly developed an excellent general knowledge of just what the papers are talking about right now, including specialized ones (up to the relatively obscure, like ornithological journals).%%%%You can readily mobilize that knowledge at the drop of a hat: as long as the info on someone or somewhere was mentioned in the press recently, you can recall it, even if the subject in question was otherwise keeping a low profile. The info can come from any media in the world, but is more precise if it's coming from physically near sources. You're not getting the news from Shanghai as long as you're in America.%%%%Not all worlds are as dangerously interconnected as this one, but the benefits of this perk still applies in other Jumps without news media: you'll just get a good awareness of what is both common (or easy to find) knowledge, along with the current subject of rumors.,,
Drop In - Who Watches the Watchmen,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,In most settings heroes and other plot important characters get undue amounts of unexamined awe, as if you shouldn't think too hard about the implications of the story bending backward to make them special. Not so much with you. You are able to look critically and unemotionally at such larger-than-life figures, both heroic and villainous. That way, you can gain and formulate insights into just what is wrong with them, conceptually and maybe even psychologically, and ultimately use this to prob for critical weaknesses and blind spots.,,
Drop In - Doomsday Clock,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,People can't help but speculate about the coming end of the world, yet they'll never know until it's there. You aren't so fortunate. Maybe you're some manner of psychic, but you know with unexplained precision just how much the doom and gloom is accurate, and can pinpoint on the metaphorical clock just how dire the situation actually is.%%%%In addition, it seems that you can at will keep the coming destruction at bay for a little longer. If all else fails, you can even be sure that some kind of Mutually Assured Destruction threat will keep any kind of madman that would end the world hesitating for some precious extra time (the exact duration will depend on the severity of the setting).%%%%This perk works for world-ending events, but even city-busting ones will pop up on your radar.,,
Drop In - Can't Change Human Nature,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,It doesn't matter all that much if the Superman is real or if the apocalypse is coming, as long as people keep being people.%%%%You in particular will continue thriving in your civilian occupations no matter how chaotic or fantastical the world become.%%%%Better, you will always manage to take advantage of such extraordinary blows to the status quo for the benefits of your own career.%%%%Doctor? You may receive extraordinary patients and get all the prestige from the event. Industrialist? Your business ventures will always be there to take advantage of the coming new technologies. Politician? Why, in such an era of uncertainty, it's only natural the people would give you unprecedented power...%%%%Similarly, it will be much harder than usual for fantastical characters such as superheroes to intentionally harm or hinder you in your professional occupations. They may try to discredit you, intimidate you, or to slow down your work through their own powers or reputation, but ultimately won't have much more success than a dedicated normal person would.,,
Cape - Retirement,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Being a hero is all fun and games until time catches up, society moves on, and the consequences start piling up around you. Lucky for you, you'll never have difficulties giving up the mask: a civilian identity will always be waiting for you and your close allies somewhere, and you can effectively disappear at the drop of a hat without causing too many unfortunate consequences in the process.%%%%This perk applies to any chosen persona you may assume, and the benefits keep applying even if you choose a new one.%%%%If you so desire, making an unexpected comeback will also be much easier.,,
Cape - Superheroics,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You're no stranger to going out in the streets and playing the part of the hero. Years of training have given you surprising expertise at handling the requirements for it, from investigation, to negotiations, to costume care... but especially to hand-to-hand combat against dozens of foes.%%%%One could even say it's always there in action that you're feeling at your most competent and in control: you experience a boost to your mental and emotional feats whenever you're in the middle of saving people or taking down criminals.,,
Cape - Comparitively Sane,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,A grown, normal adult wouldn't spend their free time trying to be a hero. Admittedly, you have your neuroses and unresolved complexes, but compared to your colleagues, you're a paragon of rationality.%%%%You will always be at least as rational, level-headed and with a good instinctive grasp on conventional morality as your saner Companions and close allies, often moreso. Better yet, you will act as an anchor for them. With enough familiarity with their mode of thinking to understand them, but the perspective to see their abnormality, you can easily use this perk to protect them against their own worst flaws.,,
Cape - Legacy,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Let's face it, you're just a fan with way too much free time. But years of single-minded fascination have put you in the position of being the natural choice for successor to your favorite hero. Figures of the past are for you an inspiration, and should they give you their approval*, you may take their mantle, effectively becoming the newest version of their persona in the eye of the public.%%%%You will not gain their powers if they have any, but your own skills should somewhat adapt to compensate for most inadequacies, and you may even become a better hero/villain/whatever than they ever were. This perk applies one “hero” at a time.%%%%*As long as they're alive – should the person be long dead, or recently dead but in good terms with you at the time of their death, feel free to ignore that requirement. Your own parental figures (aww...) are especially easy to use as your role-model.,,
Cape - Thermodynamical Miracles,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You're exceptional, even in ways you don't suspect. Really, everyone is, but in your case this gets you the ears of beings who may otherwise stop, or never start, giving a damn about puny humanity. You can effectively anchor them to the fate of this world, and when you argue with them you may even convince them of the unique importance of life in an indifferent universe.%%%%Careful: on its own, this perk does nothing to persuade them of how they should treat mankind, just that they have reasons to care about it and to respect its existence, no matter how fleeting or flawed it can be.,,
Cowl - Left Active,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You never stop in your chosen mission. Even when outside circumstances or even common sense should provide the incentive, you don't.%%%%As a result, you may well be the last of any formal or informal organization you join, as whenever your allies die, get arrested or quit, fate and your own determination will help making sure you're among the last ones left to keep going.,,
Cowl - In Here With Me,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,One would not expect some costumed freak to last long in the most hostile environments that society has to offer, but one would be wrong. Crime, war, prison: you seem to be at ease in such situations, by being badder and meaner than the rest. You can't be discreetly disposed of in there, and criminals, soldiers, etc... that are used to real life violence can't seem to get the upper hand against you.%%%%Even the harshest conditions of supernatural or futuristic prison life, warfare, etc... neither really affect nor inconvenience you.,,
Cowl - Certified Bad Ass,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,This perk will turn you into an unbelievably competent fighter: you'll be able to get the upper end in violent situations in ways that are best suited to non- ironic comic book silliness, or a Zack Snyder movie. Comes with optional slow-mo, to better appreciate them sick moves.,,
Cowl - I am Pagliacci,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You've seen the ugly face of the world, and if it has broken you you haven't really noticed.%%%%Wherever you go, you're always somehow aware of the general existence of screwed up horrors going on behind the scene, without ever (outwardly) getting incapacitated by despair.,,
Cowl - Edge,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Wow, this is a comic book, do you really need to be so dark all the time? Anyway, it seems that no matter how smelly, psychotic, or generally maladjusted you're being, and no matter how ridiculously violent and unflattering your reputation gets, you're still somehow considered an ally by other heroes, and a model by some fringe fans.%%%%Your allies will put up with you, listening to your warnings and busting you out of trouble if the need arises, even looking for you and what happened to you if anything unfortunate happens, as they would an actual friend. The fans will post on internet forums about how you're so much better than these goody- two-shoes and a mature hero for mature people.%%%%As for other, normal people? They sure as hell won't like you more, but even their contempt (whenever you grow unpopular) will be at worst dulled to a simple “geez, what an asshole” rather than actual hatred.,,
World's Smartest - The Best Superpower,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Requires World's Smartest%%%%You already know the answer: money.%%%%You start this Jump at the head of an impressive financial empire, with the quirky scientific side-projects to match.%%%%By default, it doesn't follow you in the next Jump, but you can quickly build your fortune anew from the ground up, in this Jump or any other.,,
World's Smartest - Peak Human,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You're no superhuman, but the next best thing, having become an ideal of what one single man can physically and mentally become through sheer discipline.%%%%You are not necessarily stronger than a strongman, nor faster than an Olympic champion or the best ever at chess, but you have found an equilibrium that put you well above most of humanity in feats of mind and body, and that combination alone makes you a formidable opponent.,,
World's Smartest - Untracable,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You've been beneath suspicion from the start, and you intend to keep it that way.%%%%What shady plans you may have going behind the scene will stay hidden behind a labyrinth of clandestine operations no matter their scale, and whoever tries to look into it will keep running into unfortunate hardships.%%%%Not even confronting you directly will help: You can appear the very face of innocence and fool even the most inquisitive investigators.%%%%You may even stage your own bad luck so as to appear as a victim of the conspiracy, all the while never leaving any lead that could be traced back to you.%%%%Even if someone manages to learn of your involvement, they will likely do it at the time most convenient to you, perhaps even when you precisely planned it to happen.,,
World's Smartest - Just Me and the World,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Through prolonged reflection over worldwide trends, you have gained an almost instinctive hindsight into the evolution of society.%%%%You can plan for years in advance, anticipating radical changes in the zeitgeist of the era and using them to your own advantage.%%%%You can make sense of the surrounding chaos and focus on the truly crucial problems, and mastermind solutions of terrifying elegance.%%%%As a bonus, you can also slowly and subtly influence said zeitgeist, inspiring through clever communication and branding the mood and values that will become popular in the next few years.,,
World's Smartest - Gordian Knot,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You are a master at coming up with unorthodox answers to seemingly unsolvable dilemmas and other problems, simply by thinking outside the box.%%%%The most dangerous aspect of this ability is that it transcends the narrative expectations of everyone around you: you can very effectively take approaches that are generally ignored by both heroes and villains, even stretching the limitations of how the apparent “plot” should resolve.%%%%You can in particular use other people's own preconceptions about how things are 'supposed' to go against them, acting much faster and with much better common sense than they expect you to.%%%%Good guy or bad guy, you'll never make the usual mistakes.,,
Post Human - Unquantifiable Aspects,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Superpowers don't just make you stronger; they can also give you a unique perspective on the world.%%%%You can at will use them to experience new extraordinary sensations, grow more (but not less) dispassionate and alien in your mode of thinking, see past false dichotomies used by ordinary minds and come up with you own understanding of the universe.%%%%In time, you may even develop aesthetic and philosophical notions entirely your owns, to better appreciate your unique condition.,,
Post Human - Game Changer,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You're not a simple superhero having exotic adventures with no effect on real life or the status quo; something as momentous as a true superhuman is bound to affect society, science, and geopolitics.%%%%You are skilled (or perhaps skillfully used by other people) at coming up with ways to use your abilities for real, lasting changes to the status quo, be it in the way of new discoveries or just using them in ways that are a bit more productive than just catching criminals.%%%%Be warned though that without a coherent philosophy of just what you're doing, you may end up making the world worse or more unstable without even meaning to.,,
Post Human - Surface of the Sun,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Through your new physiology*, the harshest natural environments on Earth and beyond do not seem to affect you much. If you happen to get there, you can effectively ignore such petty concerns as heat and cold, pressure, intense gravity, or radiation.%%%%*If you didn't take the Post-Human origin, you can instead choose to have this power manifest as an absurdly diverse selection of specialized suits always at the ready. The suits function as a selection of items and can be worn by other people.,,
Post Human - You're Just a Man,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Let's drop the pretense: you grew past the level of common humanity a long time ago, and they are no more threat to you than insects are.%%%%Occasionally, you can simply shrug off any attempt at hurting you by humans or similarly biologically average species*, no matter how direct or elaborate the attack is. A gun? You'll just catch the bullet. A secret weakness? They guessed wrong, you already adapted to it.%%%%This perk also makes you generally more durable against such opponents, but the proper No Sell ability can only be reliably used three or four times per Jump, after which you'll slowly hit diminishing returns.%%%%*This works even if the individual in question is exceptionally tough, competent, protected by plot armor, or using a tool that exceeds their own mortal capacities. As a guideline, a Tolkien dwarf, while still strong, is average enough to be affected by this perk, but a Tolkien elf or a Numenorean wouldn't. Any sort of person with innate magical abilities is obviously unnaffected.,,
Powers,,1,,00,,False,,False,,Exclusive to the Post Human origin,,
Power - Basic Telekinesis,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Well, this is mildly disappointing. You have unambiguous superhuman powers, judging by the fact that you can now lift up and deconstruct a car across a street with the power of your mind or create some simple matter ex nihilo.%%%%But the power alone isn't enough to make you Manhattan 2.0, merely a respectable super, unheard of across the rest of humanity. You'll need the other entries in this section, along with tons of experience, to even approach Manhattan's level.,,
Power - Watchmaker,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,What you're doing isn't simple telekinesis at all, but straight-up controlling the four universal forces to manipulate matter at every other level.%%%%You have mastered this control, and can use this power, along with any other matter manipulation and telekinesis power you may have gotten from other Jumps, to an incredible degree of precision, allowing you to modify molecular structures with the same ease as you would paste.%%%%This perk is obviously very useful in a variety of scientific and technological fields, and can also boosts the other powers in this section.,,
Power - Atemporal,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,We're all puppets to causality, you just happen to see the strings. You can experience in an instant, with perfect clarity and full sensations, any past moment of your life. You can somehow also do the same for your future* (with much lesser clarity and without context), with the dangerous caveat that every glimpse will compels you to passively make it happen – after all, for you, it already happened.%%%%In conjunction with Watchmaker, you could exponentially speed up your perception of time, enough that you could study events fast enough to escape the scrutiny of modern instruments.%%%%*Up to a few times per Jump. This ability can in theory stretch across decades, but can not get past the moment you Jump another world.%%%%Specific magical, nuclear or subatomic processes could maybe form a similar barrier, beyond which you can not see.%%%%Post-Spark, this ability is greatly enhanced and most of the limitations described here do not apply.%%%%Anti-fate perks can prevent you from blindly allowing your visions to happen, but naturally make this ability less reliable.,,
Power - Self Willed Presence,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are no longer a physical being in the way people usually think of, more of a self-perpetuating pattern that baffles conventional science.%%%%You can simply will yourself into space, teleporting across an entire solar system with little effort.%%%%You may even appear in several places at once in separate bodies.%%%%This ability does not alone multiply your raw power nor cognitive abilities, it is simply a pair of extra hands and... other bodyparts.%%%%With Watchmaker, you may eventually learn to regenerate back from physical destruction.%%%%This provide no resistance against magical or conceptual damages, which may even manage to alter or destroy the pattern, as could extremely high techs weapons.,,
Power - I Have Become Death,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Your telekinetic abilities are impressive enough that some compare you, not to a superhero, but to a god. You can manipulate non-living objects at the macro level, teleport them, and project both shields and blasts of destruction.%%%%This ability has huge raw power (which boosts any other telekinetic ability you may have), but little precision, unless you take it with Watchmaker, in which case you will have the delicate control required to teleport and alter living beings without killing them, and beyond that even trigger nuclear explosions.,,
Import,,3,,00,,False,,False,,Incompatable with Post Human%%%%100 CP each, 200 for four, or 400 for a full roster of eight Companions. They get any Origin for free and 600 CP to spend on perks and items.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Incompatable with Post Human%%%%You may take any willing human being from this world as a Companion.%%%%All superheroes start with the perks (but not necessarily the items) associated with their background (for info, Rorschach and the Comedian are considered Cowls, Ozymandias is obviously a World's Smartest, everyone else is a Cape).,,
The Big Blue Doc,,3,,-10000,,False,,True,,Incompatable with Post Human%%%%Over the course of this Jump, you'll get a shot at convincing Jon 'Doctor Manhattan' Osterman to come along with you, though his apathetic nature will make this a harder sell than you are used to.%%%%He comes with every perk associated with the Post-Human line, along with all four entries in the Powers section. Be warned that, eager to please as he may occasionally be, he's usually not the most involved nor reliable ally.,,
Comics,,2,,00,,False,,True,,You've got a free subscription to this comic collection, coming in every month in the mail. Thrilling adventures of the genre of your choice, which can be changed each Jump. With a careful read, you may even notice some parallels into your current situation and the occasional warning about the course you're following.,,
Photo,,2,,00,,False,,True,,This simple souvenir picture will always depict your single happiest memory, changing if you get a new one. Besides that, it has no power other than to be utterly indestructible.,,
Drop In - Rorschach Test,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This set of abstract pictures is a neat way to get to know a bit more about whoever is looking into it. You can use it yourself to gauge with greater precision your current mindset, or ask someone else what they see.%%%%They are under no obligation to answer truthfully, but with enough experience with the thing you'll generally have a hunch if they're hiding something.,,
Drop In - Journal,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,This notebook is full of the ramblings of a random character, chosen each Jump. While an interesting look into the psyche of its author, its real interest is in the secrets it exposes.%%%%Well-hidden conspiracies, memories lost in time or events few know off are described in its pages, and though you'll have a hard time using this as conclusive evidence, it is a very instructive read for whoever takes it seriously.,,
Drop In - Nuclear Stockpile,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Make sure to handle them carefully, and to reread the manual whenever you use them.%%%%Each warhead in stock is enough to irradiate a whole city, and you have enough of them to reduce an area large like the US East Coast to cinders. Regenerates every Jump. Unfortunately, the military equipment required to launch them isn't included in this purchase.%%%%There is, however, a catch. Each new Jump, you'll need to decide if you get access to the pile, and if you do, your biggest enemy will eventually (in a matter of years) upgrade their own weaponry to better match your terrifying firepower. It doesn't matter if you defeat them first: eventually, someone else will always catch up to you and be ready to respond in kind.,,
Cape - Tell-All Book,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Written by any person of your choice, each Jump, telling the colorful story of their life. While the information in it may not be entirely truthful (or limited by the author's understanding of the situation), it still makes for an enjoyable read full of anecdotes.%%%%Alternatively, you may choose to get a bunch of bad pornographic comics about this person.,,
Cape - Airship,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Round and running on clean energy, it can be stuffed with maybe a dozen passengers, alongside a variety of gadgets of your choice.%%%%Undetectable by radars and made of solid metal, it is a quite safe ride that can support rough landings.%%%%Design of your choice, an existing vehicle may be imported.,,
Cape - Basement,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This hidden facility is connected by secret entrances and/or tunnels up to two locations of your choice, and is rather large despite possibly being in the middle of a crowded area.%%%%The basement is also full of superhero gadgets of dubious relevance to your actual needs, but strangely enough a few of them will always happen to be exactly what you require a few times per Jump.,,
Cowl -  Button,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This cute little piece of metal is adorned with the symbol of your choice and will never leave you unless something particularly bad happens to you, upon which it will quickly find itself in the hand of an ally, seemingly making them luckier at investigating your disappearance.,,
Cowl - Arsenal,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,This impressive collection of weapons and tools can somehow easily fit on yourself with minimum inconvenience.%%%%Alternatively, you may not have proper weapons on you, but as long as you wear a particular piece of clothing you still somehow always find improvised weaponry when you need it.,,
Cowl - Mask,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Now that you've found this mask (or another similar item), you feel like your past self was only an amateur pretending to be the Jumper.%%%%Wearing it, you are certain to express your true identity, bereft of doubts, fears, and other emotional weaknesses.%%%%This mask protects your psyche, and while you have it no event will be enough to truly disturb it.,,
World's Smartest - Toy Line,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This collection of action figures includes you, your allies and enemies, and updates each Jump to include more characters and accessories. The copyrights are somewhat of a muddy subject, so if you ever try to sell replicas, be sure the original people will have better things to do than sue you for it.%%%%However, once you do, you'll kill two birds with one stone by making quite a bit of money with it, along with cementing your appeal as a popular, kid- friendly figure.,,
World's Smartest - Engineered Pet,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Like a proper mastermind, you now have a right-hand animal, created using the very best of your own technological assets.%%%%Though starting out at the level of an ordinary animal in intelligence and strength, it is exotically beautiful and a faithful, capable protector in its own right. In addition, it is both an excellent advertisement and test subject for whichever methods you used to make it.%%%%You may or may not count it as a proper Companion.,,
World's Smartest - Complex,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This Stronghold of Loneliness, this Citadel of Alienation stands alone in a remote environment, of which it can easily ignore the harshest conditions. Spacious, with an exotic design of your choice and containing both expensive, state of the art tech and an obedient and utterly loyal staff.%%%%It is the ideal place for running experiments and projects of all sort without any government oversight or media curiosity. Be wary of lone investigators.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Up to three drawbacks,, unless you take the three +300 CP ones, in which case you can pick a fourth one for +1100 CP total.,,
Saturday Morning Watchmen,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Perhaps the strict graphic novel canon isn't to your liking. With this, you may instead Jump a version closer to the movie universe, or one incorporating the Before Watchmen 'prequel' series. You may even Jump Watchmen Babies, the fake TV series, the unproduced movie script, or any version of the universe of your choice, with the exception of silly crossovers with other universes such as the DC one. In any case, don't expect events to play out easier for you.%%%%But perhaps that instead of going to the world of Watchmen at all, you'd rather visit the universe of the Charlton Comics, where the story of Watchmen was initially supposed to take place. Very well. The plot will be just as dangerous and tortuous, but you'll meet the original Charlton characters rather than their counterpart (that is, Captain Atom instead of Doctor Manhattan, Blue Beetle instead of Nite Owl, etc...). As they are generally more powerful and competent than the Watchmen version, it will cost an extra of 100 CP to companion them, with the exception of Captain Atom, still capped at 1000 CP.%%%%Does not count toward the drawback limit.,,
Influenced,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You should really assert yourself more.%%%%Starting from your childhood you've just been doing what others expect you to, and even grown up you still reap the psychological consequences of doing so: either deep but aimless resentment, or even an innocent tendency to continue doing anything authority figures ask you to.,,
Their Morality Escapes Me,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Who can really tell all the consequences of their action, and definitely declare them good or bad? You certainly can't, and maybe you do not even care.%%%%For the duration of your stay here, you will have trouble gauging both the specific consequences and the morality of your actions, and often look back in confusion at the horror that they produce.,,
I Did It!,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Some close ally, perhaps even a Companion, has privately come upon a terrible greater purpose that requires the execution of a plan of uncountable casualties. They will act in secret from you, and you will neither remember having taken this drawback nor expose their involvement unless they wish you too.%%%%Should you press on in exposing the truth, they may even decide to get rid of you, by any mean necessary.,,
M.A.D. World,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,For the duration of your stay here, the Cold War will never, ever stop heating up. Crises will spark chaos, chaos will spark fear, and fear is very likely to make everything go boom.%%%%Any action you take to slow down the escalation will be a toss-up, just as likely to end up making things worse.%%%%If the nukes start flying, you and your Companions will definitely die along with the rest.,,
Thirty Five Minutes Ago,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You are late. Always late to understand the mess you're in, and always too late to catch up with the sinister plot unfolding around you. You keep ineffectually flailing around, trying to save the day, only to realize there's nothing left to save by the time you arrive.,,
Friendly Middle-Aged Man,,4,,00,,False,,False,,You're not that much of a superhero, you just dress like one. Any out of Jump power and item you have is locked for the duration of the Jump, and so are your Companions'.%%%%To make things worse you're 1d8*5 years past your prime. Hope you have a good left hook.%%%%For the Post-Human background, you are instead too young and inexperienced, and your in- Jump capacities are about half as effective as they could be.,,
I am Dissapointed,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,The good new: Doctor Manhattan is no longer a bystander in the history unfolding around him, choosing instead to take a more active role.%%%%The bad new: he's mostly decided to cause random mass destruction, for reasons poorly understood. It's up to you to stop him, by reason or by force, and he's unlikely to hold back long enough for you to survive the encounter.,,
OR ALL DIE,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Something went wrong when you materialized into this world. Or perhaps you're simply the unexpected replacement for Adrian Veidt's engineered monster.%%%%Whatever way, you're stuck as a monstrous, vaguely freudian-looking mass of flesh, unable to move except by using crude teleportation methods.%%%%Any attempt at communication will simply result in you sending painful and incoherent psychic waves at your interlocutor.%%%%On the other hand, you gain this as an altform post-Jump. Yay!,,
