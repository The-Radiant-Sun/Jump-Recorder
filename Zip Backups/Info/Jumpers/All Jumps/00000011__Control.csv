Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Outsider,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You, like Jesse Faden, are someone from outside of the FBC who has somehow stumbled their way into the building. Maybe you were brought in right before the Lockdown to be interviewed about a strange event. Or maybe you managed to see through the perception filter around the Oldest House and came to investigate the strange building. You could have wandered in via a Threshold, an area where universes overlap, which are common in the Oldest House. Whatever the case might be, you are here now, and with the current crisis, the FBC won’t have the resources to try and punish you for ‘invading’.,,
Researcher,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are one of the many researchers in the FBC, seeking to understand the myriad of bizarre phenomena that occur around the world, out of sight of most of humanity. You will likely have some specific field of study that you specialize in, such as Pareidolia or Memetics, but now, it is all-hands-on-deck to try and study the Hiss phenomena and find a way to contain it and neutralize it.,,
Security,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are the wall that stands between humanity and the unknown. Often armed with little more than specific rituals that you can only pray will help to drive off the strange forces you contend with, you nonetheless will do your part to defend the world against paranatural threats. Luckily, there are a large number of threats that react to a barrage of bullets the same way that most humans do. That is, by dying.,,
Infected,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Whatever your origins might have been, you are now one of the infected, having been filled with the strange incantations of the Hiss or the spreading spores of the Mold or some other danger that lurks within the corridors of the Oldest House. And yet, somehow, you have retained your sense of self. You are still you, despite your infestation, though it will likely be a challenge to convince the FBC itself of that. And if the Hiss or whichever group you are part of should manage to break free from the lockdown and take over the world, you will end up standing out as not being under their control, which could be a quite uncomfortable bit of scrutiny to be under.,,
Location,,0,,1000,,False,,False,,You will be starting within the Oldest House, but given its extended, labyrinthine interior, there are a lot of potential areas where you can begin. You may choose from the following list, or, if you are willing to let the whims of Luck guide you, you can gain +100 CP by rolling your starting location on a D10.%%%%Unless specifically noted, you can appear anywhere within your given location, but by default, you will appear within a Safe Room or equivalent ‘stable space’, so you will not immediately be thrown into danger.%%%%1) Lobby: You appear in the entrance to the FBC, possibly passing through the front doors right as Jesse herself enters. The Janitor Ahti will be here, and can open the way for you to move deeper within the Oldest House.%%%%2) Executive Offices: You appear somewhere within the Executive Sector of the house. You could be close to Trench’s office, or somewhere within the Communications department, which handles various pieces of correspondence and coordinates Bureau operations.%%%%3) Maintenance: You appear somewhere in the Maintenance Sector of the house. You might be near the NSC power generator, or down in the pipes and sewage.%%%%4) Research: You appear somewhere in the Research Sector of the house. You could be in one of the labs, or in the main atrium of the sector.%%%%5) Containment: You appear somewhere in the Containment Sector of the house, outside of the Panopticon. This could include the Medical Wing, or the Prime Candidate Programs, or the Storage Areas near the Turntable.%%%%6) Investigations: You appear somewhere in the Investigations Sector of the house. You might be in the Observation Deck, or in one of the sections dedicated to a specific Altered World Event.%%%%7) Panopticon: You appear within the Panopticon, the massive vault where many of the Altered Items collected by the Bureau are stored.%%%%8) Threshold: You appear in one of the Thresholds attached to the Oldest House, areas where some other dimension has leaked in and attached to our own. You could be in the Clocks in Containment, or the Mold in Research, or the Quarry in Maintenance, or in some other Threshold entirely.%%%%9) Foundation: You appear within the Foundation of the Oldest House, a maze of caves and caverns that lies deep below the rest of the structure.%%%%10) Oceanview Motel: You appear within the Oceanview Motel, a strange building that exists somewhere in Montana, but can be travelled in and out via the Lightcords, pull cords that bring someone in and out of the Motel when pulled three times. It is linked to the Oldest House via doors found within it marked with an inverted black triangle.,,
Parautilitarian,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You are now a ‘parautilitarian’, a person with sufficient mental power to be able to link to Objects of Power and utilize their abilities. Even without linking, you will gain a vague empathic sense for the emotions of those around you, and strong but unfocused telekinetics, which can mainly be used to execute a force telekinetic shove or push. Your main ability will be the ability to link to Objects of Power, forming a connection that can allow you to borrow their abilities, which can range from levitation to mind control and more.%%%%In future Jumps, objects with strong supernatural powers or links to the combined human subconscious can be treated as Objects of Power and bound for abilities as well. Upon binding an object, you can be transported to a temporary mental space, where you can go through a brief ‘tutorial’ on how to use the object’s power.,,
Anti-Hiss,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Jesse Faden was made immune to the Hiss via her relationship with Polaris, and now, you have the same immunity, with the source being this perk instead. You are able to travel through Hiss-infected areas without becoming infected yourself, and if you selected the Infected Origin, this Perk is what allows you to retain your mind while still gaining some powers from the Hiss or whatever other phenomenon has infected you.%%%%If you spend 300 CP, this immunity will continue with you into future Jumps, and expands to all forms of possession, corruption, and mind control, rendering your will inviolate by any external force, and even if you do allow someone within your mind and soul, you can still perfectly isolate and ignore any influence they might try to exercise over your will, and expel them at any time.,,
Outsider - Trust,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You may have just wandered in off the streets, but I’m sure that the FBC can rely on you to help them out, right? For some reason, people will just seem to trust you when they meet you, even if they have little to no reason to actually do so.,,
Outsider - Life on the Run,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have the skills of someone who has raised themselves on the street. You have experience at a wide variety of odd jobs, a large amount of street smarts, and a truly amazing capacity for figuring out how to live ‘off the grid’, to the point where you could manage to hide for years from a government organization whose entire purpose is to seek out the hidden and strange.,,
Outsider - Mental Monologue,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You never need to be lonely when you can have conversations with yourself. You can, at will, hold a conversation within your own head. This can include any entities or beings who you might happen to be hosting, but even if you are the only tenant within your brain, you are able to basically make duplicates of your own mind that you can talk to and bounce ideas off of.%%%%Even better, this mental discussion can seem to take several minutes as you deliberate, but will only take a second or so on the outside, leaving those watching you none the wiser that any such discussion took place.,,
Outsider - Attention Highlight,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It can be quite difficult to try and find a specific paper on a bunch of desks strewn with files, or to locate the specific switch in a darkened room that will open the door so you can escape. Luckily for you, when you are looking for something, you will find that objects of interest to you are highlighted with a faint white ‘outline’ when you are nearby (within ten to fifteen feet or so). This outline is even visible in the dark and through thin barriers, such as the surface of a desk, helping you to home in on exactly what you are searching for.,,
Outsider - Purifier,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Paranatural events often leave scars, twisting the world in permanent ways. But now, you have the power to set things to rights.%%%%You are able to focus and expel a form of ‘purification’, which can do things like expel possession, correct mutations, banish malignant energies, heal wounded psyches, and generally ‘set things right’. This does have a physical and mental toll, leaving you a bit winded after, purifying a person or room. You would be even more exhausted with more severe distortions, but after a short rest, you’ll be ready to go again.,,
Outsider - No One's Pawn,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The FBC is controlled by the Board, a mysterious group of extra-dimensional beings who operate according to their own inscrutable goals. They have set out a path for the Bureau, but you... you are no puppet, and you won’t dance on anyone’s strings. You have your own path and goals, and even when events are foretold or predicted, you are able to make your own choices, unbound by anything like fate or prophecy. Indeed, fate and fortune shift to suit your desires instead.%%%%When you have a goal, and some piece of destiny would help you achieve it, you will be able to borrow from that ‘certainty’ to aid your efforts. And when prophecy would oppose you, you become a hidden variable throwing off all predictions. And either way, those whose leashes you’ve slipped will have difficulty actually spotting that you aren’t dancing to their tune.,,
Outsider - Director,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Comes with a Free Service Weapon Object of Power.%%%%You can either choose to become the new Director of the FBC, supplanting Jesse Faden as Trench’s successor, or you can take a new role, the Vice-Director or Co-Director. Roughly equal in authority, though perhaps just a bit more distanced from the Board. Jesse could take those positions if you take over as Director, if you wish. Either way, taking on this role will give you a few major perks.%%%%Firstly, it comes with a tremendous level of parautilitarian potential, easily placing you in the top 1% and beyond. Whereas an average user might strain to throw a book across a desk, you could hurl a car down a street, as an example. Secondly, you have a great deal of authority within the FBC. This is paired with an expectation of you actually working with the organization, but you will be in a position to set policy and determine how the organization actually operates. Finally, you can choose to have a similar position within a similar organization in any future Jumps, complete with a hidden, shifting base just like the Oldest House.%%%%This organization will be dedicated to the same goals as the FBC, namely the study and research for strange supernatural events. In worlds where supernatural phenomena doesn’t exist, they might be focused on debunking strange occurrences, while in other worlds, they may focus on containing or protecting the ordinary world from the supernatural one.,,
Researcher - Educator,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Subjective reality, unconscious archetypes, synchronicity, resonance. There are so many topics involved in understanding paranatural phenomena, and a proper understanding of these topics can actually have a tangible impact on how well your fellow FBC agents are able to handle paranatural threats they might face. Luckily, you have a great deal of skill in breaking down complex topics into simple and yet still entirely accurate explanations, helping even the most meatheaded grunt wrap their head around things like how Thresholds work or the dangers of the Astral Plane.,,
Researcher - Steady Mind,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,There are many risks involved in the study of paranatural phenomena, and sometimes, the lesser risk is in dangerous experimentation to understand an Altered Item’s limits, so that you can properly contain it rather than allowing it to run out of control. Lesser wills might quail at the danger that you have to subject yourself and others to in order to study these objects, but you are able to maintain a clear, objective outlook, keeping the greater good in mind when designing experiments and studies.,,
Researcher - Pieces of the Puzzle,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Everything is connected, and insights into tricky problems can come from unexpected places. You can pick a topic or conundrum that you wish to solve, and set it processing in the back of your mind. As you go about your day-to-day, insights will occasionally spring out to you, giving you the clues needed to put together the entire picture and solve the problem you are pondering.,,
Researcher - Ritual Knowledge,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The most basic method of containing Altered Items is through the use of rituals. Turning a light on and off three times. Spinning in a circle on each landing in a stairwell. Tapping a doorknob before grabbing it to open. You now have a comprehensive knowledge of various ritualistic behavior, and can, with a bit of study, work out what rituals might be needed to placate or control some paranatural phenomena.,,
Researcher - Mental Briliance,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Intelligence isn’t the only thing needed to understand paranatural phenomena... but it really helps. You are, to put it simply, brilliant. A genius with knowledge in multiple areas, ranging from electromagnetics to biology to psychology and more.,,
Researcher - Methods of Obsession,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It sometimes feels like, if you could just push a little farther, that the mystery you are researching would simply unfold before you. For you, obsession is a rabbit hole that leads to a hidden realm of new understanding. By fixating on a topic or concept, you can leap forward in your understanding of your target, and this understanding can bleed over to other topics linked to it. New vistas of understanding will open up as you dive into your obsession, but it will do little good if you lose yourself completely.%%%%Task those you trust to reel you back, bring back with you the knowledge you’ve managed to pull from the depths.,,
Researcher - Alterd Item Creation,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Comes with a free Hotline Object of Power.%%%%You have managed to gain one of the greatest secrets that the FBC has been searching after for decades, if not centuries. The method by which Altered Items can be created, and how they can be transformed into Objects of Power.%%%%You can construct a ritual, a blending of technology and mysticism that will take an object, and focus belief and thought about the object onto it, bathing it in raw paranatural resonance. Eventually, the item will transform into a true Altered Item, with a strange power somehow linked to its nature and the ideas that people have about it.%%%%A postage stamp could gain the capacity to ‘send’ ideas into the heads of those nearby. A traffic cone would give those who approach it a looming sense of danger. A clothes hanger might gain the capacity to cause items to vanish into a ‘storage space’. Once an item has been ‘Altered’, you will then need to take steps to link it to the Astral Plane, forming a channel between the object and the collective unconscious.%%%%This is a delicate process that can destroy the object if you are not careful, but once complete, a parautilitarian or similarly psychically empowered individual can connect to the object and borrow its power, gaining some skill such as Telepathy, Danger Sense, or Storage. To start with, it would likely take several weeks of effort to make a single item, but as you explore the process, you can discover shortcuts and improved methods to speed up the process.%%%%Altered Items and Objects of Power you create are immune to corruption by the Hiss or similar powers, and while anyone with psychic power can bond with them, you are able to purge bonds you disapprove of, as well as storing them in a space like your Warehouse and still accessing their power.,,
Security - Loyalty,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You support those who follow you, and they will support you in turn. You excel at inducing loyalty in those around you, and as long as they know you are working to help them, they will have a significant boost in courage as well.,,
Security - Well Trained,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have the training of a special forces operative, capable of fighting in combat in any locale and instantly assessing the strengths and weaknesses of even the most inhuman foe. Your training covers the use of firearms, hand-to-hand combat, small group tactics, and explosives.,,
Security - Sorrow Suppression,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,When you see someone you’ve fought and bled alongside die in front of you, or are faced with some horror from beyond space-time, it can shatter your resolve to continue. You, however, can effectively put such negative emotional reactions on hold, delaying actually experiencing them until you have time and safety enough to properly deal with them. You can’t postpone feeling them forever, but you can put off mourning until the current threat is handled, at least.,,
Security - Environmental Awareness,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The key to proper defense is awareness of your surroundings, and you have it in spades. You can instantly catalog a room for cover and fire lanes, you can maintain constant awareness of your squad and their positions, directing them effectively through hostile environments, and you can detect instantly when shifts happen, allowing you to react instantly when some paranatural effect distorts gravity or twists the walls into the floor.,,
Security - Para-Bullets,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Many of the threats that you face off against can simply shrug off things like bullets or grenades, using glowing energy shields or strange distorted spheres of space-time or just sheer dense masses of flesh to render your bullets to nothing more than pinpricks. However, your particular attacks have a strange property.%%%%On impact, they cause damage to spread out through the target, even propagating through things like energy barriers or armor. Hit a target’s arm, and damage will spread out and hit their inner organs. Hit their weapon, and damage can also spread back to them. So long as you hit your target or something they are wearing or actively controlling, they will take non-trivial damage.,,
Security - Reviver,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Quite often, Security for the FBC is the first, last, and final line of defense between humanity and paranatural terrors. If you fall, there may not be any others who can step up to take your place. So, it is up to you to fight on, and fight on you shall. When you take lethal damage, even when it is catastrophic damage that should kill you instantly, you can still continue to live and fight for several seconds at least, up to a minute or so.%%%%Even when missing a section of your torso or most of your head, you still can somehow function, and if you manage to actually take down a foe while in this state, you will instantly heal from the lethal damage you’ve taken, enough that you could survive and fight a bit more.,,
Security - Black Rock,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Comes with a free Ashtray and Cigarette Object of Power.%%%%Black Rock. A frankly miraculous material that can suppress almost any paranatural ability, acting like lead for paranatural ‘radiation’. It is the key to many of the FBC’s security procedures, and now, you embody its effects. To start with, you are simply far tougher than you actually should be, more resistant to damage or impacts. But more importantly, your mere presence severely dampens the effect of paranatural effects around you.%%%%This can include supernatural effects from other sources than the “resonances” that you encounter here, but the moment that they come close to you, they will be severely weakened. And that is not all.%%%%You can choose to ‘close the Firebreak’ and render yourself entirely immune to such effects, allowing you to simply no-sell supernatural effects the instant they make contact with you. The cost of doing this, however, is that you will have to severely weaken any supernatural abilities that you yourself possess (excluding the Perks associated with this Origin).,,
Infected - Apathy / Peace,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,So safe and nothing to worry about. You can spread a gift of peace with your presence. Some small-minded might call it apathy, but truly, who would not wish to have their fears and hopes and desires dissipate in a haze of blissful numbness?,,
Infected - Crawling Through the Cracks,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You came and we let you in through the hole in you. There are those who would seek to keep you out, to hold you and what you offer at bay. But you have a sense for the gaps that you could slip through. Vents and crevices in the walls, guards who are less-attentive or more... open-minded.%%%%Your eyes lay bare the imperfections in their defenses, and what else could such gaps be but an invitation?,,
Infected - Hiss-cantation,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,An earworm is a tune you can’t stop humming in a dream. You are not the Hiss and the Hiss is not you. In truth, you have a Hiss of your own. A series of phrases which hint at a deeper meaning and description of your goals. When an individual repeats these phrases, you will become aware of them and their surroundings, capable of acting as if you were physically present in their place.%%%%These phrases are somewhat ‘sticky’. Difficult to forget once one has learned them, and why would they wish to forget them, anyway?,,
Infected - Seeds of Paranoia,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Through a mirror, inverted is made right. There are many doubts that lurk in the hearts of those around you, doubts that you can raise to the surface. Whether through subtle comments, innocuous acts, or methods more obscure, you can fan these flames of paranoia to grow, eventually reaching the point where they no longer require your tending to continue to perpetuate.%%%%Reality is subjective, after all, and who can say that these fears are not simply truths unspoken?,,
Infected - Infectious Presence,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The name of the sound. It resonates in your house. Your will is a shadowy light that reflects in the eyes and minds of those you interact with.%%%%With a touch of effort, you can project your will, causing the wills of those around you to reflect your own intentions and desires. Longer exposure will supplant more of their thoughts with your own, and could even see some portion of your paranatural power gifted to those that most strongly reflect you. This infection can spread from those who carry it, at least in terms of will and thought, though the more generations between you and a new host, the longer it would take for them to be infected.%%%%In the end, your will is righteous to yourself, and so why would it be wrong that all come to reflect you?,,
Infected - Insane Power,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you. Paranatural power relies on viewpoint. A subjective view is needed to truly make the most of the gifts you have been granted, but the purest view can only be seen when one releases the tired strand of the chain known as sanity.%%%%You can allow your mind to slip into madness, distorting your view of the world, and in so doing, vastly increasing your ‘parautilitarian’ powers. Other powers that rely on supernatural forces can also benefit from this descent. Or perhaps it would be better characterized as your mind rising to a new vista of maddened clarity?,,
Infected - Mr. Door,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Comes with a free Slide Projector Object of Power.%%%%You are a worm through time. The thunder song distorts you. All of reality resonates with a common song, and you can hear this melody.%%%%More than that, you are capable of playing on the instrument of your own self, altering your resonant tune to attune yourself to the song of a different world. You can tune yourself lightly to view a new world, spying on parallel realms where history has diverged or the fundamental laws have fallen in a different configuration. You can feel out these worlds to identify what dangers you might face, and then, if you are resolved, you can step from this room into the next, attuning to the new melody to step into the different world.%%%%But no matter how far you roam, you can always perfectly recall the song of the world that you first stepped from within each new house you visit, and can instantly return to it. It may take a few minutes to fully step through, but what are a few moments taken when one has an eternity to explore?,,
Outsider - Keycard,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A keycard that has a chance at opening locks when waved near them. A lock you have the key for or explicit access to will open automatically. A lock securing an area you don't have permission for will have a decreasing chance of being unlocked based on how secure the locked area is. The keycard will have to 'cooldown' after an attempt before you can retry if it fails.,,
Outsider - Un-Redactor,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A tool for finding the information that is being kept from you. A magnifying glass that, when held up to a document, will fill in the blacked out or left blank fields of information in the document.,,
Outsider - Ahti's Cart,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A fairly ordinary looking janitorial cart, fully stocked with all sorts of cleaning supplies. Perfect for a janitor's assistant to be cleaning up. The supplies never seem to run low, and most impressively, the surroundings of the cart will clean and repair themselves just by being in proximity to the cart.%%%%A floor full of offices could be repaired from pushing the cart slowly around the main hallway, and the fixes will happen when those nearby aren't paying attention or get distracted. It's why janitors work best at night, no?,,
Outsider - Lightcord,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have a connection to the mysterious space known as the Oceanview Motel. A dreamlike area that can link to many important and supernatural spaces within a given world, it is accessed via a pull cord.%%%%Various instances of the pull cord will appear near you, transporting anyone who pulls them three times to the Motel. You can encourage the pull cord to appear at specific points, and with practice, could get the Motel to conceal or protect certain passageways or link areas together. Exploring the puzzles and halls and rooms of the Motel could allow you to find many new areas to explore.%%%%Just don't commit violence or destruction within the Motel, or you will find your journeys through it to become much more difficult and hazardous.,,
Researcher - Labcoat,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,White labcoats don’t tend to stay white for long when used, but this one has the effect of actively repelling stains of contaminants. This ensures that not only will it stay shiny and white when worn, but it can also keep, say, an exploding pustule full of caustic ooze from splattering on you and burning your flesh.,,
Researcher - Secret Files,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The FBC keeps a lot of secrets, so many that it is inevitable that some of the information they have will... ‘slip through the cracks’. This filing cabinet is filled with numerous documents discussing a variety of classified topics and hidden secrets. Primarily, these documents will deal with you and those you are closely associated with. Government memos about you, paranoid ravings about you from your former neighbor, hints at the location of some long-lost relation.%%%%Some of the documents will be about things unconnected to you, but which you may still find interesting, and new documents of either type will appear in the cabinet from time to time. The cabinet itself also seems too small for the many, many files it contains.,,
Researcher - Control Point Tech,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,One of the key technologies that actually allows for the FBC to actually operate within the Oldest House. Normally, the Oldest House will shift and rearrange itself in a myriad of ways, shifting corridors and rooms and their contents around freely. However, with the advent of the Control Points, specific areas of the house could be ‘locked’ in place, preventing the local area from shifting, and even keeping the various points positioned similarly relative to each other.%%%%You now have the blueprints for this technology, and can implement it to help defend a space from all sorts of spatial distortions. This can range from keeping the environment and space from being warped, preventing or redirecting teleportation and other space-warping travel effects that try to enter or leave the area, and recording various alarms when similar feats are attempted.%%%%You can also link relatively close points together to allow for instantaneous travel between them.,,
Researcher - HRA Maker,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The HRA is a marvel, allowing for the influence of a specific paranatural resonance to be mimicked and spread, to provide an extremely thorough protection against hostile forces and possession. You now have a stockpile of resources and technological know-how that would allow you to create your own HRAs. These devices don’t rely on the specific resonance of Hedron to function, instead being able to replicate both potential functions of the original devices separately.%%%%Your version of the HRA can either mimic the effects of some sort of paranatural or extradimensional energy and provide those effects (or a useful subset thereof) to the wearer, or they can provide a comprehensive protection against possession, alteration, or manipulation by some other paranatural or extradimensional energy. It is entirely possible for the device to do both functions at the same time.,,
Security - Standard Issue Weapon,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,This is not the Service Weapon, but it is certainly a serviceable weapon. It consists of a semi-automatic carbine with a few magazines of ammunition that will refill themselves over a couple of hours once emptied. A decent weapon for fighting the good fight.,,
Security - Explosives,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Even in paranatural circles, most things will die to a big enough boom, and you have plenty of boom to go around.%%%%This purchase will provide you with dozens of grenades, a missile launcher with a couple dozen missiles, and some larger placeable explosives linked to a detonator strong enough to crack Black Rock. They will all restock within a couple days of being used.,,
Security - Jukebox Token,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A jukebox and a dozen tokens to play it. This version isn’t an Object of Power like the one you would find in the FBC, but it has a similar function. By inserting a token and selecting a song, you will be transported to an arena for 25 minutes as the song plays. Within the arena, you will be given a variety of tasks and challenges to complete, ranging from fighting waves of enemies, to transporting objects to specific markers, to solving puzzles.%%%%You will revive if you should die, but when the song ends, you’ll be instantly transported out of the arena. You will gain prizes based on how well you performed, which will generally take the form of currency or ingredients and materials. Also, the song you can choose isn’t limited to one song, and the nature of the song can influence the shape the arena takes. The dozen tokens will restock, but you also have a simple blueprint for how to make extra.,,
Security - Panopticon Cells,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,This structure takes the form of a miniature Panopticon, with several dozen cells inside. Each cell is designed to contain and suppress supernatural abilities, as well as keep living beings alive even without food and water, to prevent chances for escape. Even better, it contains its own power generator, strong enough to run all cells by itself for months at a time.%%%%However, it is not necessary to rely solely on that, as each cell is set up to be able to act as a miniature NSC, using the energy of the objects being contained to both run itself, and potentially even send out excess energy that is harvested from the contained subjects. The cells contain an array of sensors that can be used to study the subjects, and the scans gained can be processed to help refine the containment measures to be ever more efficient.,,
Infected - Scribbled Notes,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The word that describes this is redacted. There are times when a fevered mind can see clearer than a sane one. You have a stack of papers, covered with feverish writings and strange drawings.%%%%Many of the scrawled phrases seem prophetic, telling of current and future events if you could just look at them just so and understand the mind that wrote them. The notes change over time, continually providing you with hints at things that are and will be.,,
Infected - Burned Slide,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The picture is you holding the picture. A completely blackened slide, utterly useless for acting as a portal with a certain Object of Power. However, the slide itself still contains a connection to a massive amount of paranatural energy, constantly leaking it over time. Keeping the slide on you will heal you and recharge forms of supernatural energy that you can draw on. The healing and charging is slow but constant. A faster draw can be forced, but will shut down the item for a short time afterwards.,,
Infected - Hiss Node,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,We build you till nothing remains. A glowing red cube, made out of solidified Hiss. The unprepared minds exposed to it may exhibit traits of madness, though they will not actually be infested by the Hiss from just this. Instead, its primary ability is to create a solidified barrier around the holder, shaped from their ‘personal power’.%%%%The stronger you are in any respect, the stronger this barrier will be. It is primarily attuned to resist damage of mundane sources. Bullets, bombs, that sort of thing. It will be noticeably weaker against paranatural or supernatural energies, but it will still take significant effort for even those who are actually stronger than you to break through it.,,
Infected - Black Hedron,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You want to listen. You want to dream. You want to smile. You want to hurt. You don’t want to be. A large, black geometric structure. It invokes feelings of size and weight from those who view it, and it is inextricably linked to you.%%%%At the most basic level, it acts as a reservoir and catalyst for any supernatural energies that you have access to, capable of refilling your own reserves with just a few moments of direct exposure. What’s more, abilities that you possess, especially protective abilities, can be infused in it, allowing it to spread those abilities and projections to those nearby. It may even be possible to figure out a way to use this as a focal device to share those abilities remotely. Finally, should the unthinkable occur and you actually fall and die during a Jump, this item can call you back, causing your fallen corpse to vanish as if a mirage, and you to reappear by the structure, fully healed.,,
Objects of Power,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Typically, many Objects of Power can only have a single parautilitarian bound to them at a time, and who can use a given object seems to be controlled by the mysterious “Board”. This would mean that you would have to deprive Jesse of her items if you wanted to take their powers for yourself. However, you can avoid that by purchasing a duplicate of the item here. These duplicates have the full function of the originals, while being unconnected from the “Board” itself. As with the originals, once bound to these, you don’t need to remain nearby to use their abilities unless otherwise noted.%%%%As long as you took the free Parautilitarian Perk, you can take two of the 100 CP Objects of Power for free, but you must pay full price for more.,,
Floppy Disk,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A floppy disk containing outdated nuclear launch codes. Binding it grants you the “Launch” ability. You can latch onto nearby objects, up to around the size of a refrigerator, and pull them next to you, building up a charge, before hurling them at high speeds towards a target.,,
Merry-Go-Round-Horse,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,An antique carousel horse. Binding it grants you the “Evade” ability. You can shift your body at very high speeds in any direction. Multiple uses can be chained together to cover distance rapidly, and it can even allow for a form of ‘pseudo-gliding’ when used rapidly in midair.,,
Benicoff TV,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,An old television set. Binding it grants you the “Levitate” ability. You can hold yourself in the air, rising to a height of roughly thirty to forty feet, and moving around at a brisk pace for a few minutes before you will need to land. Even when landing or otherwise ‘out of power’, you can slow your falling speed to a slow drift at will.,,
X-Ray Light Box,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A box used to examine x-ray images. Binding it grants you the “Seize” ability. You can focus on a target to forcefully gain control of their mind. This is extremely difficult against a focused, aware, and healthy target, but the more distracted, dazed, and injured they are, the easier it is to grasp their mind. Once seized, they will act as an ally to you, though they won’t speak, so prying secrets from them will be difficult. A handful of beings can be Seized at a time.,,
Home Safe,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A thick sided safe. Binding it grants you the “Shield” ability. You can gather loose objects around you into a floating barrier of debris. Your telekinetic energy uses the floating objects as a framework to bind an actual force barrier onto, blocking even attacks that might normally pass through the spaces between objects. These barriers can withstand significant punishment before breaking, and the debris can be used as an improvised attack when dismissing the shield.,,
Service Weapon,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,A strangely blocky gun. Unlike most other Objects of Power, the Service Weapon must be wielded to be used, as the weapon itself is the power being granted. The Service Weapon can take a variety of forms, gaining new forms upon exposure to new weapons to mimic their basic properties, and you can import one of your existing weapons into it to start with.%%%%It is even possible for it to take forms other than a gun, such as a sword or hammer. Unlike the Original, having this does not necessarily automatically make you the Director (unless you took a specific other purchase), but it does act as an emblem of authority. So long as you hold the Service Weapon, anyone will automatically believe you when you claim a position or authority that you actually possess, even with no other proof.,,
Hotline,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,A red, corded telephone. Binding it grants you a mental link to the Astral Plane, and allows for communication with spirits and entities that dwell there. The Astral Plane is a realm founded on the collective mental unconscious of living beings, especially humanity, and so this link will update in future Jumps to include the closest analogue / analogues that exist. Some sort of Astral Plane will exist in any future Jump you go to, and the most commonly encountered communicators within it will be dreamers or the spirits of the recently deceased.,,
Ashtray and Cigarette,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,A steel ashtray and a constantly smoking cigarette. When this Object of Power is activated, an impenetrable maze will form around the ashtray and the space it occupies, up to the size of a moderately large building.%%%%The maze itself will appear to externally take up the same space as the inner sanctum it guards, but within will create an infinite array of shifting corridors to prevent passage, and it can even redirect teleportation or dimensional travel effects that would try to bypass it.%%%%Only the binder can allow passage through the maze, typically by summoning the cigarette and giving it to someone to hold as they move through the maze.,,
Slide Projector,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,A manual slide projector and a collection of slides. Binding it allows the user to open doorways to different dimensions by inserting a given slide into the projector and turning it on. One of the slides will be linked to a fairly peaceful and idyllic house and meadow and will remain constant between all Jumps. Other slides will link to stranger dimensions and will shift with each Jump. In future Jumps which contain known alternate dimensions, slides will appear for those dimensions. The binder can instantly return to the ‘door’ that has been opened while in an alternate dimension, and can manually activate or deactivate the Slide Projector, though the ‘door’ will appear in the same location for each alternate dimension.,,
Second Nail,,2,,-5000,,False,,True,,A large pyramid like structure, which pierces through the Astral Plane and into reality. Like all Objects of Power here, it will start out bonded to you, but it has a sentience of its own. Not strongly defined, at least at the moment, but something that can grow in time. The basic power of this Object is simple: It will act as the foundation for your very own ‘Oldest House’. Initially, it starts out the size of a large suburban home, inside and out. In time, it will be able to expand its dimensions, and in a few decades, it will likely have an interior the size of a large corporate complex, at least, and it can keep growing from there. It will start out with a couple of key abilities, namely, the ability to freely rearrange its interior, and the capacity to develop Thresholds. As the being bonded to it, you will be able to direct the internal changes somewhat, though the development of Thresholds is generally much more random. That said, any Thresholds will cease growth or expansion upon you exiting a given world, instead functioning as something of a ‘keepsake’ or ‘memento’, an area reflecting that portion of your journey. Once you achieve your Spark, these Thresholds can once again reconnect with the universes they were formed from.%%%%Depending on what ‘capstone’ Perks you’ve taken, the Second Nail can gain some additional abilities. It is possible that these abilities will develop anyway, given a few centuries, but this will allow you to start with them right away if you have the proper perk.%%%%Director:%%A director will need good help, and now, beings that are manifestations of some aspect of your Oldest House can appear within it. A custodian, a secretary, a mysterious old resident. Whoever they might be, their very being will reflect the overall intelligence of the Second Nail. They will not be true Companions, but will persist within the House from world to world. As a side note, the Second Nail and Oldest House can integrate into the headquarters of your future organization, if you wish, or they can remain separate from jump to jump.%%%%Altered Item Creation:%%Your Oldest House will naturally be able to form Altered Items within itself, but it will also actively assist you in keeping them contained and pacified. It will also be able to link up to any Objects of Power that you form, acting in a capacity similar to the Board, helping to judge worthiness according to standards that you set.%%%%Black Rock:%%Your very own Black Rock Quarry will appear as a Threshold within your Oldest House. Starting off as not much more than an area of the black stone that can be mined by you, it will grow in size as the House does, and can potentially gain stranger areas, with rocks of different properties in the farther reaches.%%%%Mr. Door:%%You have much more control over how your Oldest House forms Thresholds, and can help to guide it to fusing parts of dimensions or other worlds into itself to bring along to future Jumps. You can also help it to link to other paranatural / supernatural structures that you might encounter, and help it to emulate some of their functions by ‘matching their resonances’ to expand its abilities.,,
Being of Resonance,,3,,00,,False,,True,,You can gain an extra-dimensional being made of resonance that is now bound to your body and mind. While they can count as a Companion, they do not have a physical form outside of your body, remaining constantly linked to you, even in future Jumps. They innately will defend you from mental intrusions, but they do have access to your mind themself. They can boost supernatural abilities, and can potentially access the various Perks and Powers you gain. Choose wisely, for though they are friendly, they would be a companion with their own will, not a slave.,,
Survivors,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,With each purchase of this option, you can invite two survivors to accompany you. They will have the basic gear and abilities they possessed. If you want to take Jesse Faden, she will take up both ‘slots’ in a Purchase, as she will be bringing Polaris along unless something happens to separate them. Combined, they will take up a single Companion slot.,,
Perk 65,,3,,00,,False,,False,,,,
Sealed Danger,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,If you wish to bring Dylan Faden, Moss-1, The Former, or any other dangerous paranatural entity along, you will need to select this option. The danger that they possess will be sealed, leaving them with some power, but preventing them from being an unstoppable danger engulfing humanity in future Worlds unless you deliberately choose to unseal them.%%%%Even then, the seal would reestablish when you moved on, until you chose to release it again.,,
Ahti,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,Ahti, the Janitor of the Oldest House, has chosen to accompany you as part of his vacation. Technically, you could have him accompany you for free, in which case he will simply appear in future Worlds that you visit, but won’t aid you in any way. Paying the price here will have him join as a true Companion, using his unique insight and undefined levels of paranatural power to assist you. As well as helping keep your Warehouse and other properties shiny and clean.,,
An Ordinary Begining,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Rather than starting in 2019, when Jesse finally tracks down the FBC in New York, you will instead start in Ordinary, Maine, in 2002, at the point when Jesse and Dylan first discover the Slide Projector out in the junkyard and turn it on. Ignore the Location Section above, and instead pick any area within Ordinary to arrive at. You can choose to intervene in the ongoing events, or allow history to take its course. If you select this toggle, you can extend your stay up until the time period of the Hiss Invasion of 2019. If you end up preventing that event from ever actually occurring, then you will stay for the typical ten years.,,
No Cover,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Enemies you face seem to be exceptionally adept at working around cover. Arcing their shots, using ricochets or area attacks to lash out around corners, etc. You will have little, if any, time to catch your breath while hunkering behind a cabinet or wall before some attack will force you to keep moving.,,
Mistrust Runs Deep,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,How can you trust anyone, when they all could betray you at a moment’s notice? You will find it exceptionally difficult to trust those around you, constantly suspicious of their motives and holding back information lest they use it against you. Even your long-time companions won’t be excluded from this effect.,,
Perk 71,,4,,00,,False,,False,,,,
Bomb-Happy,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Enemies that you face all seem to be extremely into explosives. Constantly throwing out grenades or firing missiles, you will have to keep moving to stay out of the blast radius. This is heightened by the fact that a lot of items in your surroundings seem to be explosive as well, detonating if broken or even jostled too hard. Fortunately, these explosive hazards are marked with some symbol that indicates their explosive nature, but you’ll still have to be cautious with how you wreck your surroundings, to ensure that it doesn’t literally blow up in your face.,,
Security Protocols,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Normally, security in the Oldest House takes the form of security doors that can be accessed via specific keycards, and which can often be bypassed by some clever environmental destruction. Now, however, the security procedures are much more obscure. You may have to use the “Diamond-Four” keycard, along with the “Omega-M” password to access a door, and then face another door behind that which requires the “Platinum Rose” key to be turned in the lock exactly three and two-fifths rotations counter-clockwise. It will take a lot of searching and trial and error to track down all the bits and bobs you need to progress through different sections of security, and it will be very, very difficult to find any way to bypass these locks and doors.,,
The Duck Quacks at Midnight,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are being followed around by a rubber duck. It will appear right behind you at random moments, letting out an extremely loud quack, and then vanish the moment you turn to try and grab it. Any attempt to trap or block the duck will fail, and destroying it won’t stop it from reappearing and making you jump with a loud quack.,,
A Fallen World,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Ordinarily, if the worst should happen, and the Hiss escapes from the Oldest House to end humanity, you would have the opportunity to run and hide if you could. Now, however, that is not an option, as your fate is tied to the successful containment of the Hiss. If the Lockdown fails and the Hiss takes over, it will be Jump Failure for you.,,
Building Shifts,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Normally, the Oldest House is fairly stable, at least with regards to the major landmarks and areas. Now, however, the entire House seems to be shifting constantly, with no area you visit staying the same for very long, and shifts potentially happening right under your feet. A few select areas, such as the Executive Area right around the Board Room, can be stabilized enough for space to stay stable within them, but the areas in-between will be in near constant flux.,,
Ahti's Tasks,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Ahti has jobs for you, and you will find that you cannot progress on other objectives until they are complete. He will contact you via mysteriously appearing radios with the details, and any attempts to ‘move the plot along’ or otherwise complete other tasks after Ahti has contacted you about a job will fail or stall out, until you do the job he has assigned. Typically, it will be something like cleaning up garbage in a specific area, but you might get a task to fight Ahti’s great nemesis, the Clog, in some out-of-the-way sewage pipes.,,
Mental Strain,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Ordinarily, paranatural powers can be used fairly rapidly, with only short breaks to recover energy needed before they can be used again. Now, however, rapid use of paranatural abilities will cause a growing probability of you suddenly experiencing a splitting headache. Use an ability like Launch or Dash a few times in a minute, and you will have maybe a 5 to 10% chance of a sudden headache. Use them a dozen times back-to-back, and the probability can soar to 50% or more. This will extend to other mental / psychic based powers you might possess, and will mean that you need to be judicious in where and how you use your abilities.,,
Let's Join the Threshold Kids,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You will not be entering this world as an adult. No, instead, you will be starting out with the mind and body of a child. No older than ten, and possibly younger, you will find that abilities that increase your physical and mental capabilities are much less effective, and while you will have your memories and personality, you'll have to deal with things like being cranky without naptime or crying when you are scared.,,
Perk 80,,4,,00,,False,,False,,,,
Dreams Within Dreams Within Dreams,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Are you truly a traveler between worlds, or did you simply dream that it was so? You aren’t sure, with your memories of prior worlds, and your meta-knowledge of this one, fading into nothing more than a vague mishmash of half-remembered dream fragments. You will forget about the vast majority of abilities you might have possessed, and any imported companions will be similarly vague in the details of how they know you, or what adventures they might have shared with you. Fortunately, this is a world where dreams and memories can be explored, so if you chase down the fragmentary trail of dreams, you may be able to recover some of your memories, and the powers that are connected to them.,,
Safe Spaces,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,There are Safe Rooms set up throughout the Oldest House, areas where every precaution is taken to help isolate them from hostile forces and protect those within. Now, these sorts of spaces are the only safe areas in the house, with the area outside of them being full of all sorts of hostile and toxic energies and obstacles. You will find your health failing the longer you spend outside of either a Safe Room or an area stabilized around a Control Point. Your health will recover swiftly once you make it to such a protected area, but you will have to be quick, as these effects are constantly changing, and can work through even most exotic defenses to sap your strength and vitality.,,
Panopticon Prisoner,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Rather than arriving in your chosen location, you instead arrive as a prisoner within a cell in the Panopticon, a cell that has been specially attuned to diminish any and all superhuman powers to virtual nonexistence. On the positive side, the protections also function to keep the Hiss and other hostile forces out, but you will be stuck there until some force acts to free you, and given the many dangers in this place, such a force will likely not be friendly. Even once you are free, it will take a while for the bindings you are under to wear off and grant you your full range of power once more. Any Companions you import will be likewise contained within cells upon import, and you cannot access your Warehouse or any special items until you are freed from your cell.,,
Lockdown Time Limit,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The Lockdown keeping the Hiss from spilling out into the outside world cannot last forever. Specifically, it is only able to maintain itself for 24 hours. So, you have that long to ensure that the Hiss is neutralized as a threat, or they will spill out and consume all of humanity. Oh, and that will count as a Jump-Fail for you, so don’t think you can just write off the world and continue on your way. As this overlaps with the effects of A Fallen World, you cannot take both of them.,,
JRAs,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Do you recall the Anti-Hiss perk? Whether you took the free version or paid for it, it is now tied to a technological harness on your body, along with any other anti-possession or mind control powers that you might possess. And if the harness should end up getting damaged or removed, all of those abilities will be removed, and you will be open to the mercy of the Hiss or any other hostile memetic forces. No other forms of mental protection will function for you while you are here, so you best keep that harness in good shape.,,
Former World Items,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Items have appeared for each of the previous worlds that you have visited, and all the powers that you possess from said worlds are now infused within these items, turning them into Objects of Power. Any items you bought from those worlds are also fused / sealed within these OoPs, and the only way for you to regain those powers and access those items is by forming a link to the OoP, after tracking down its location within the Oldest House. Just be wary, as other parautilitarians can likewise use the OoPs to access your powers and items, and even once you’ve established your connection, outside forces could seek to steal them away. Fortunately, they are not truly connected to the Astral Plane, so corruption by The Hiss, The Former, or The Board is not a concern. At least, not directly.,,
Trench was Right,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Trench was right to be suspicious of Polaris’ motives, as they are just as malicious as the Hiss, they just put a better spin on their actions. The HRAs are a form of brainwashing, which keeps the Hiss out, but places those caught in it under Polaris’ thrall instead. Jesse is Polaris’ pawn, just as much as Dylan is the Hiss’, and both of them seek to overtake the Board, and thereby, reach out to control humanity. You will now have to face both ‘factions’ and ensure that neither of them succeed in their aims. Can you manage it?,,
Hiss, Mold, and More,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,You no longer have to just worry about the Hiss, with a few bits of the Mold popping up here and there. No, now there are at least six different ‘factions’ invading the FBC all at once. Perhaps burning beings of flames are lurching out of the Furnace, or strange clock-faced angels are appearing and stuttering through time in the Clocks. Whatever the case might be, you can’t afford to ignore any of these invasions to focus on the rest, you’ll need to fight a war on at least half-a-dozen fronts simultaneously and come out on top.,,
Northmoor Unleashed,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Broderick Northmoor was the first director of the FBC, or rather, the first director chosen by the mysterious “Board”. He was a powerful parautilitarian who gradually began to lose control of his powers, eventually being contained within the NSC power generator within the Maintenance sector, where the excess energy he generates could be used to power the entire building. Now, however, he has broken free, having been given a vision of your arrival, and convinced that if he can kill you, he will regain control and surpass his current strength. His breakout will occur within a few hours of Jesse’s entrance, resulting in the loss of power to much of the House, and Northmoor himself smashing his way through all obstacles in search of you, seeking to crush you for his mad delusions. You will either have to defeat him or find some miracle that can contain him, and pray that the destruction he causes will not release the Hiss out into the wider world.,,
