Name,,Type,,CP Change,,Active,,Chained,,Description,,Notes
Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,An unknown, a mystery that hails from another world. You have no history here, no friends or foes to hinder or help you in your goals -whichever those may be. You start with a room rented for the week in a good hotel on your initial location as well as a bunch of papers proving your identity and enough money for a full meal. The rest is up to you.,,
Ordinary Student,,0,,00,,False,,False,,,,
Knight Templar,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Knight Orders have been around for centuries, if not millennia. While the Campione may take care of Heretic Gods, no one can predict their temperaments or completely rely on them for all supernatural disasters, sometimes there isn’t one at all. Thus, Knight Orders exist to take care of those ‘minor’ magical problems in the world and assist Campione should they need it. You’re the child of one of these orders, trained and instructed since childhood to stand up against those threats to humanity. The disposition and activities of your order will depend on your initial location.,,
Magic Scion,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Hermetic magic, witchcraft, prayers, supernatural powers. They come in many names, but the magic that humans wield is all the same in the end. Not nearly as powerful as the Authorities of the Gods, but they can be quite more useful and still a great edge against the supernatural. Your family has been in this magic business for quite the amount of generations, becoming somewhat influential and powerful in the meantime. You, of course, have inherited their talent and honed it since childhood, becoming now a mage or witch of renown.,,
Heretic God,,0,,-5000,,False,,True,,You’re not a mortal. No, you’re a [Heretic God]. A being born from the worshipping and myths of humanity, but grew unsatisfied with the current situation and pulled yourself out of the realm of legend to freely walk in the world of mortals. As a Heretic God, you aren’t seen by normal humans, only by magicians and the like. Unless you choose to show yourself to them. You’re immune to all mundane weapons, no matter their nature, and only the most powerful mortal magic can barely harm you. All Heretic Gods are immortal, living forever unless killed. Even if killed, however, a Heretic God will merely return to the myths and legends which spawned them, and may return to the human world in time. As long as their myths and legends exist, so too will the God in some fashion. However, your biggest advantage is the [Authorities] you possess, the powers you were able to wield in all the legends associated with your being, a magic completely unrivalled except for other [Authorities].,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,There are seven Campione, each one laying claim to one nation or another. In some cases, they don't even claim, as it's simply the natural course of action for a Campione to reign over the lands where they reside. Choose where you want to start, there's no shortage of interesting events, after all.%%%%Britain%%The rainy island home to the black prince Alec, prime Campione and kleptomaniac. Here also resides the main quarters of the Witenagemot in London and the Royal Arsenal in Saint Ives.%%%%Italy%%Home to the Seven Prestigious Mage Associations, including the Black Copper Cross and the Black Silver Cross. The Campione of this land is the Lord Salvatore Doni.%%%%America%%The United States of America, the land of the masked superhero John Pluto Smith (also known as Annie Charlton without the disguise). The Sorcerous Sacrilege Investigation manages things here.%%%%Japan%%Home to Kusanagi Goudou. Supernatural beings and problems are dealt by the History Compilation Committee, which is managed by the four families and the government.%%%%China%%Here resides the Holy Cult of the Five Mountains and the Campione Luo Hao, an arrogant martial arts master that is as beautiful as strong.%%%%Hungary%%Homeland to the Campione Sasha Dejanstahl Voban, a man obsessed with hunting strong beings and dressing like dracula.%%%%Egypt%%Not much is known about the magic world in Egypt, somehow, Madam Aisha is supposed to be here, even though she’s from India and actually travels a lot around the world and time.,,
Reward the Child,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Favoritism is the name of the game and you’re a natural at it. Wherever is because good impressions, some fortuitous coincidence or pure dumb luck, you seem to receive more blessings than you should get. For example, winning some small lottery would give you also a secret prize, buying an old magic book could come with some extra teachings inside and if you ever become a Campione, you can bet that the [Authorities] you get will be a cut above others.,,
Those Who Would Be Kings,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Before their successful acts of deicide, a Campione is an extraordinary person able to find a way through even the direst of circumstances. Sharing in that prerequisite, you find yourself blessed with the qualities that would guide you towards such a fate.%%%%Courage and will to face down a heretical god despite being an otherwise normal mortal, paired with cunning great enough to link together a means to make their downfall a reality should they be available.%%%%Luck to create miracles that snatch victory from the jaws of seemingly certain defeat, if it is indeed at all possible for you.%%%%In more ancient times you would find yourself leaving a name in history that altered its course globally, provided you did not simply content yourself with lesser pursuits.,,
Pandora’s Child,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Ah, the Campione, the unrivaled humans that managed the impossible: to slay a deity by themselves. They are Pandora’s adopted children and the owners of a few advantages. Now, you’re one of them too.%%%%As a Campione, you gain an all- around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn’t have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay.%%%%Don’t get too lazy because of this, I must warn you, many Campiones have fell after relying too much on their natural advantages, since there are ways to go around them.,,
Drop In - Ordinary Man,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Magic, gods, sorcerers, Campiones and other such childish nonsense. You aren’t here to keep up with the stuff of bedtime stories. There are actual problems to deal with, taxes or not getting evicted from your apartment for a start. To let you concentrate in adult matters, you naturally pass unnoticed by gods and other supernatural beings or organizations, provided you do not seek to interact with them. They won’t affect your everyday life directly or otherwise unless you provide a compelling reason to do so.%%%%This effect can be toggled on and off.,,
Drop In - Could You Not,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Absolute madman would be how others see you when you tell off a Campione straight to their face or batter them about the head while deriding them for the latest travesty. Words escape them when you fail to turn into a pink mist, and you thought you saw something white at the corner of their mouths when it actually got through. Simply put you have a way with words and actions that reach even the quirkiest or alien of individuals, provided they will entertain communication at all. This doesn’t prevent them from harming you if you cross the line, only allowing for them to understand beyond their own twisted frame of reference without impediment. A useful trait if you insist on running with that sort.,,
Drop In - Are You Free This Weekend?,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Well, well, well. What do we have here? Jumper, again trying to charm your foes into submission? Because this is meant to help with that. It won’t really do much at first glance, enemies that supposedly hate your guts are more inclined to some banter, those who oppose you in for practical reasons act way more relaxed than they should and may try to befriend you in their free time, even those who would hate you on principle may think that you aren’t entirely incorrigible. To make a long story short, you seem to easily win the respect of your enemies. Enough to spare your life in combat or even make them change sides, with enough time.,,
Drop In - What’s This Doohickey?,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Ah, supernatural powers. They don’t come with an instruction manual, be it the magic of mortals, the Authorities of Gods or something else entirely, one needs to get their exact limits and improve themselves by trial and error. Well not anymore, this little blessing works to take care of that. Now, you gain an innate knowledge of how to use any new powers you acquire, as well as their limitations and advantages. Doesn’t sound like much until you get a power-up in the middle of a battle and you realize you don’t know how to use it. Embarrassing.,,
Drop In - The One Moment,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Timing. It’s all about timing. Asking out a girl, trying to score a new job, getting in a fight with the law. The results may completely depend on the timing of your actions. That final slash to your archenemy, that cool entrance just in the nick of time to save the princess, or when you try to have a heart-to-heart with your friend. Get it wrong and your archenemy survives, the princess dies and your friend are estranged.%%%%Failure is not an option. For you it never shall be again so long as you actively work towards making it on time.,,
Drop In - Slipping Chains,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The greatest power in this world have conditions to their use. Anything from standing in sunlight to being at death’s door to fight back depending on which Authority you hold. Often times just setting things up to begin fighting could leave you dead on the ground if everything doesn’t line up just right. In your case the chains that bind have been coated in grease. Sunlight could be replaced by electronic lights in great enough quantity, or perhaps a ludicrously sized fireball. Defending a fair maiden could become defending anyone, and one the verge of death could become grievously wounded.%%%%The core idea remains the same, but achieving them becomes far easier. You’ll find this slippery nature applying to any conditional otherworldly abilities you come to possess, should you have them at all.,,
Drop In - Princes of the Universe,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Pandora is the name of the goddess who creates the Campione. An artifact known as the Circle of Usurpation, and a glitch in the system of divine reincarnation allows her to take certain things from the slain heretic gods, and instead award them to her adopted children. Regardless of the details of the system, you now own a slightly different copy.%%%%This fake Circle of Usurpation is not necessary to continue to grow in power in other worlds, but rather for other worlds to grow in power. Once per jump you can select a ‘type’ of foe for this to affect. In the same way Campione gain Authorities from the slain Gods, you can set a system that gifts powers from those slain beings to others that match your rules.,,
Ordinary Student - Sportsy Normie,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,A healthy mind does squats in a healthy body. Doesn’t matter if the nerds complain you got the saying right or not, because a good body always has its perks. So, you have been practicing sports for a while now, eventually you found yourself blessed with great talent in a particular field, enough to compete in the nationals and go even further if you apply yourself. Should you decide not to, you’re still a great athlete all around. If nothing else you’ll find it hard to find others who can flex on you without a serious search.,,
Ordinary Student - Man With A Mission,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Jobs, quests, operations, assignments, they come in many names, but the nature is all the same. The routine of being hired for any kind of strange, bizarre and dangerous jobs with equally stunning rewards. This little perk ensures that you’re the top option for anyone who knows about you and want or need something done. Be prepared to be sent in travels across the globe to change the direction of some rock or take care of some high schooler’s romantic problems. Of course, it comes with good rewards that somehow help you out in your present or future endeavors, and you can always just refuse if you don’t want to do,,
Ordinary Student - Around the Corner,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Good ol’ luck. Not the Irish one, but the real deal. You got the Devil’s luck. Enough to win the lottery as many times as you play it, no matter how improbable that is. You always get the best numbers and so long as something is a matter of chance, consider it good as won. The same luck applies to your everyday life, encountering artifacts or befriending those that will help you out in the future. Really, the only people in this world as lucky as you are the Campiones and those with the inborn talent to become one.,,
Ordinary Student - Family Traditions,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Scum runs through your veins in the same sense blood does for decent folk, just as it did for the rest of your family tree. When other kids were imitating anime after school your family was showing you card cheats, in between having you help them scam up that night’s dinner of course. A snake as slippery as you aren’t easy to catch in the act by others, nor is a stranger to all politics in earth. Leaving you near untouchable by back door maneuverings. With deceit oozing out of every action you would make a frightfully talented politician if you decided to bother trying.,,
Ordinary Student - Demolition Man,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You’ll have to forgive others for the title, given you could very well be mistaken for an avatar of destruction with how much ruin lies in your wake. The bright smile you have on your face the more damage you dish out doesn’t help either.%%%%Seemingly predestined to destroy all you touch; your actions and powers have a talent for causing more damage than reasonably possible with every step. While this doesn’t help in direct combat, the surroundings come apart with frightening ease such that even a simple exchange between equals could leave a noticeable scar on a city or an all-out brawl demoting it to village status. Of course, you can reign over the amount of collateral damage in any fight you partake on, from none to destroying the roman colosseum in a friendly spar.,,
Ordinary Student - Fate Fell Short,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Given you broke its knees before the race even began after all. If destiny ever had a say in things then it shuts up and listen when it comes to you. The power of ‘fate’, ‘destiny’ and other bullshit has no say in your affairs. This is something that all Campiones share, being humans that killed Gods, but you take it to the next level in terms of sheer ‘fuck this’. Meaning that there’s nothing stopping you from breaking destiny and its rules as much as you feel like. This doesn’t make those tasks any easier, but they are not impossible anymore. Can be toggled if you ever feel like fate is actually helping you for once.,,
Ordinary Student - Natural Born Gigolo,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Godou is a natural lady’s man, just like his grandfather, and while there are some others popular with the ladies, none is as good as him. Well, until you came here. Whatever charm this guy had is nothing compared to yours, attracting women is not something you need to put effort in, but rather a sub- product of your continuous existence. Even if you don’t do anything out of the normal, girls become attracted to you like bears are attracted to honey, even mortal enemies will fall quickly to your natural charm and become allies. What if you try your hand at it? Your flirting and seduction skills are a godly thing, so let’s just say that there’s no female that can resist, to the point they will accept sharing as long as they can be with you. As expected, you also win a similar level of proficiency in the sack as well as managing your never-ending harem. Mages? Heretic Gods? Campiones? Knights? Well, some are natural born warriors, you’re a natural born harem master.,,
Knight Templar - The Magic Of Mortals,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The esoteric powers for mortals aren’t quite the same as those of divine nature, being more akin to borrowing small amounts of magic force from the gods, a prayer answered. Still humans have come quite a way through making do with what they have. You are a prime example of such, being trained in spell and sword with focus on their physically practical applications over versatile occultism from a young age. While you aren’t quite in the same league as the Great Knights that lead their Orders, you could reach them in time given enough effort and opportunity.,,
Knight Templar - Modern Myth,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,This is a world were all myths and legends hold some truth to them, as such, you have been studying them from as far as you remember. Researching Gods, heroes, and esoteric matters in detail left you with a wide arrange of knowledge about them, their cults and related trivia. From the origins of certain heroes, association between gods and festivities, evolution of cults and which ones still remain in some form. This knowledge will update each world you visit, provided they had a similar cultural progression. Also, that historical and myth trivia may be a nice way to make small talk with others.,,
Knight Templar - Noble Retinue,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Even within the ranks of the knights, you have special talents that separate you from the common ones. More specifically, a talent for finding talented individuals predisposed to becoming friends, rivals, or retainers with little effort, easily extending your sphere of influence and supporters. This also works towards other affairs, like finding good ways to make money and decent skill at managing what amounts to a modern-day fief, even if the world has moved on from feudalism. You could even lead your own Order eventually.,,
Knight Templar - Flower of Chivalry,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have come a long way in your training, always holding code of chivalry in your mind and actions, you became able to apply it without doubt or complications even in a grey world like this. You possess the heart of a lion which never backs down, the leadership of a true captain, the mind of a great strategist and the luck required in finding a worthy master to serve and gain greater glory for you both. Truly you are what all other knights aspire to be. It’s not only your heart which holds strong, but also your mastery over magic and swordsmanship is now equal to any Great Knight.,,
Knight Templar - Paladin,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The exact rank of paladin hasn’t been reached by anyone in a good while, people like Ena Seishuuin or Erica Blandelli are close, but not quite there. Saint Raffaello being perhaps the last one. It not only requires the leadership, tactical mind, magical prowess and excellent swordsmanship required for Great Knights, but also needs to go a step beyond that. Paladins are those with the power to go toe to toe with a Heretic God or Campione, even if a win isn’t really sure. That was until you came along, you now hold the title of Paladin within the magical community, as well as everything that entails. If this is enough for you to actually win against a Heretic God or Campione is up to the air, but this ensures you will be a good fight at the very least.,,
Knight Templar - The Devil Wears Prada,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,While politicians try to sway away many people at once and entrepreneurs focus on the target audience for their products, you decided to go a step further in convincing others of doing your will. Indeed, one-on-one interaction how it works best for you at persuading people. Be that you want a new contact, a spy in the enemy lines, or just getting someone to agree with your social views. Your social-fu is at the level in which you can have almost anyone warped around your finger after some interactions. It still works to some extent in multiple people at once, but not as good as when working in a single person at the time.,,
Knight Templar - A Million Ways,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Slavatore Doni, a heretic genius capable of matching any Great Knight with swordsmanship alone. Luo Cuilian, an absolute master of martial arts and Daoist Arts. They are grand warriors who faced gods with nothing but their honed skills, perfected to an inhuman degree, and came out winning the battle. Now, you join their ranks as the great master in one skill of your choice. Take blacksmithing and start forging weapons that can hold their ground against Authorities or Divination and start spoiling the hell of all those shows that are yet to finish. Sure, you could also choose swordsmanship and become the only decent practice buddy for Salvatore. In any case, you also gain a small boost in learning other skills directly tied to the one you choose.,,
Magic Scion - Ascendance,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The disposition of a miko, a woman descendant of a Divine Ancestor who has retained some of its power. The benefits of this are two-fold, the first being a ‘gift’ passed down your bloodline and the second being the ability to use witchcraft, a system of magic different from the hermetic spells used by mages, letting witches use spells than can’t be done by mages, like flight. By default, your gift is a weak version of the Spirit Eyes, which lets you connect to the Memories of the Void in the Netherworld and investigate the past of things and beings. Although you can also choose to have a minor form of Telekinesis, Spirit Senses or Prophesy.,,
Magic Scion - In The Blood,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Eugenics, baby. Blood ties are important for a reason and now you have control over it. You can choose any of your traits, powers or gifts to become a sure pass down to all your blood descendants. It could be your miko gift, your magic reserves or even some natural predisposition or talent you may possess. Whatever it is, it will become a trait carried over all your blood-related descendants.,,
Magic Scion - Barenaked Lady,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It seems the power carried by your blood was stronger than expected. By this I’m talking about your gift as a miko. Perhaps it’s stronger than normal, having Spirit Eyes than can only be rivaled by those of Mariya Yuri or maybe you won the lottery with a stronger gift like Divine Possession, also called Advent Magic, which lets you channel the power of a God. In any case, your talent is greater than average and the rate to master your power is tremendous.,,
Magic Scion - Daoist Arts,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,An Asian form of spellcasting, based on the Feng Shui, Astrology, and other traditional Asian beliefs and centered in the manipulation of qi. Doubling as a type of martial art, it gives the practitioners several advantages that other mages lack, including the ability to cast spells with a set of movements instead of words and manipulating qi (life force) for a myriad of effects. You start with a great grasp of the basics and some advanced techniques, your talent being enough to master this art in a few years of practice.,,
Magic Scion - Disaster Purification,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,A rare and powerful gift, the ability to negate all mortal magic that come in contact with it, strong enough to even weaken Authorities to a degree. Even someone without training in using such a power can easily dispel weaker magics around. For you, however, the scenario changes having mastered this gift completely and with enough control to not let your own magic be negated. The go to gift for anyone who wants to act as an anti-mage.,,
Magic Scion - Pinnacle of Magic,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Alice Luise and Lucrentia Zola, the two most renowned witches of this era, masters of not only their power as mikos, but also of their respective ways of witchcraft and hermetic magic. Now, you join their ranks in terms of power, skill and knowledge. Not only you have mastered magic to the same level as them, but also obtained domain over several lost spells and your own miko gift. You could go places with this amount of power.,,
Magic Scion - The Mystery of The Past,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Divine Ancestors, despite being little more than the shadow of their power as Gods, are still leagues above mortal mages. Hime-Mikos and Witches having to work with the measly leftovers of their power. That changes now. You have inherited the ‘full’ powers of a Divine Ancestor, enough to consider yourself near the level of a weak Heretic God. Be in terms of magic reserves, skill, mastery or sheer number of spells in your repertoire. Fighting Gods may be a tall order, but far from impossible if you play your cards right.,,
Heretic God - More Than a Myth,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,All Heretic Gods are cursed to cause mayhem and chaos as they walk among the living once again. It’s part of their nature to cause them, albeit in different ways, a sun god would spread wildfire, war would cause armed conflict, etc. Not even the King of the End is completely immune to this. Your nature is different, however, more tempered and calmer, able to travel with freedom. Thus, you aren’t restricted by this anymore, being able to completely contain yourself until you choose to awe the lowly mortals. Should you deign to do so, you can still let your nature leak like your contemporaries, but even then, you will be able to select the scope and nature of your divine radiance.,,
Heretic God - Fairytale Princess,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Seems like this place is filled to the brim with characters that could work as models at the least, to make things fair and not let a God like you looking like some NEET, I’m giving you this. No, not the power to shapeshift. Instead, what you should focus on is that fact that your appearance is now something from that fairy tale, such as that the kings of this world would genuinely call you beautiful. There are no mortals to best you in beauty, and only the gods of love are truly your betters in this field.,,
Heretic God - Beyond Those Wild Dreams,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,A Heretical God’s power isn’t defined by their fame, nor how powerful they were in their myths, but rather their will and determination. Traits which you have in spades. Why would a God like yourself shackle himself down to the perception of mere ants? Who are they to decide your origins or demise? Your journey is yours and yours alone. Not only is your presence in the world of mortals’ iron- clad, but all your powers are near their maximum while perceptions that would change you fail utterly, backed by your extraordinary willpower. Where others would be fragments, you are whole.,,
Heretic God - Philosophy of Billions,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,While the overall strength of a Heretic God is determined by its willpower, the history that accompanies their myth gives an undeniable edge. Yours is one of the most extensive around, with your origins being associated to the earliest legends of mankind and tied to many cults and changes over the years. While this won’t make you more powerful per se, it will grant you a greater repertoire of Authorities to use. Perhaps you’re the ruler of the underworld, but also a God or fertility, wine, heroic deeds, or even of love and war.,,
Heretic God - Divine Ancestor,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Born from those Gods that lost their divinity and Authorities, reincarnating as something more than human, but not quite Gods. Remnants of ancient power, but not to be taken lightly. This power is alike such occurrences, a fail-safe, if you must. Once per jump, upon your death, you may return yourself to life in a weakened form, with only a mere half your power available to you until the jump ends. Much like a Divine Ancestor, you won’t be much more than the shadow of who you were at your perk, although you could probably regain full power with some sacrifices...,,
Heretic God - Killer Queen,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Once Pandora’s binding fades from the minds of the Divine Ancestors, there can be only one thought that crosses their mind. To reclaim their missing power. Thus far, there have been only mild successes, with most failing altogether or worse, coming down with a severe case of inbound Campione. Should you find something lost to you, sealed away, stolen, or something else altogether, you will find it far easier than it ought to be to either reclaim that missing power, or to steal something equal in value from another. It should also be noted that you also possess the skills at politics and backstabbing to gain assistance from other Divine Ancestors, and that your attempts are always more successful - and rewarding - than theirs. In fact, why don’t you go ahead and calculate the interest on this forced loan? Because that too will be yours in time. In short? The farther you fall, the farther you rise.,,
Heretic God - Highway to Hell,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,For all the power of the Heretic Gods, they are limited in harsh ways. Whatever power they gained in their worship, whatever names they took and causes they championed, are now their chains. Rumor, myth, and legend give them power, but a power without one of those is one they cannot possess. Even the queen of the divine ancestors, Guinevere, accidentally created a new god during an attempt to empower her king. You might know him as Arthur. Rebelling against their own story, or perhaps more importantly, the fact that it is over, caused the gods to transition from truly divine to ‘heretic’. You, however, have actually succeeded. You are capable of growth even when growth ought to be impossible, of changing your nature as a God without becoming [Heretical] in the process. This power bleeds out to the rest of you, letting you overcome any set limit, like striking twice with a weapon only usable every ten years, or maybe something as simple as learning a skill that you do not meet the requirements to learn. Your continual growth might as well be a fact of existence.,,
Authorities,,1,,00,,False,,False,,[Authorities] are, so to speak, the magic of the Gods, above the realm of mortals. These are the divine powers, attributes, blessings, curses, talents, abilities, qualities, and weapons wielded by Gods, demons, heroes and even monsters, in myth.%%%%As expected, they have been shaped by the legends surrounding them as well as their wielders and thus, [Authorities] are quite flexible, being able to be used in a myriad of ways, as long as it fits their concept. In the right circumstances [Authorities] can be mastered or even ‘evolve’ lifting up previous restrictions or granting a greater scope in their effects.%%%%Here are some examples of Authorities. Heretic Gods can take up to 5 of these, although they may have more from their legends. Those who took the ‘Pandora’s Child’ perk and thus start as a Campione, get up to 3. Likewise, you can choose instead a similar Authority from canon, with similar effects and limitations.,,OC Authorities are meant to be flexible and examples. Authorities later can become ridiculous. Up to you how new ones work.
The Winds of Fortune,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Chant: “Never I shall be lost, never my path be lacking light, never my will shall waver. At the end of the road, all treasure is mine”%%%%Effect: A power befitting of those who seek more. This Authority enhance the user’s speed up to godspeed when in search of something, as well as an instinctual knowledge of its location, be an ancient lost item or a path to the netherworld. It also grants a second, passive ability to the user, to never get lost when travelling, always having a decent idea of where he is.%%%%Downsides: The user needs at least some vague idea of what he’s seeking and must exist, otherwise the Authority shall lead him to the next best thing.,,
Whimsical Help,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Chant: “Offerings are rewarded with Blessings. Blessings are rewarded with Offerings. I shall give everything and I shall take everything.”%%%%Effect: A power that’s never the same, it has two abilities. The first is when the user gives an ‘offering’, be an object, blood or whatever, and in exchange gains a ‘blessing’ that matches the value of the offering - this value can be a subjective or objective one, whichever favors the user more. However, the user has no input in what kind of blessing he shall receive. The power and scope of this Authority fluctuate greatly depending on the offerings given to it, giving up a powerful grimoire could end up boosting strength and a cherished but mundane item can become a magical weapon. The second power is the capacity to grant lesser copies of the user’s powers to those that give a suitable offering, one decided by the user.%%%%Downsides: It’s possible to overuse this Authority, at which point it will become truly whimsical with the blessings it offers.,,
Hunter of Immortals,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Chant: “A spear that pierces gods, a rock that kills giants, a sword that beheads monsters, a shield that resists death. All my allies will be protected! All my enemies will fall!”%%%%Effect: A sentient Authority and weapon that regards its user as a puppy regards their owner. Will shapeshift and grant different boosts to the user depending on which foe he’s facing at the time. Likewise, the weapon can slowly absorb the power of the enemies during battle, eroding their defenses and weakening their attacks, all while transferring that power to the user. With enough damage, it may be able to steal powers or traits from its foes and give it to the user.%%%%Downsides: If broken, it will take a week to repair itself. If facing too many powerful foes in quick succession, the weapon might become saturated and stop granting boons for an hour.,,
Sunlight Burst,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Chant: "I am Light, I am Immortal, thus I am the Sun. Fires of the Sun which dispel all evil, engulf me so we may cleanse this world of wrongdoing."%%%%Effect: Just the rising phoenix or the mighty core of earth, the user becomes a being of fire that burns as hot as the sun. While this Authority is active, the user will be invulnerable to most attacks as he’s a being of fire, he will also gain temporary master over fire magic. When the Authority is dismissed, the user is restored to full health.%%%%Downsides: It can only be called during daylight and when active it causes a great deal of damage to the surroundings as well as taking a heavy tax in the user’s magical reserves.,,
The Broken Cycle of Life,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Chant: “Rules may rise, empires shall appear, civilizations can advance. But none will ever hinder me, for my domain contains the immortal souls of them all. Heed my call! Arise!”%%%%Effect: Rulership over the souls of the dead. The user can call them forth from the underworld to make use of their knowledge or expertise. Summoning them as ghosts won’t take much toll, but the user can also exert a greater deal of magic to create a suitable vessel for the soul, matching their likeness when alive. Likewise, the user could also tie the soul to an item.%%%%Downsides: The user must know a decent deal about the soul he’s calling. The cost of each soul and vessel depends on the abilities and powers the soul possessed while alive.,,
World’s Maker,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Chant: “My inspiration is unending. My creations are peerless. My tools are unrivaled. My hands shall give birth to perfection only. For of all makers I reign as supreme”%%%%Effect: Three effects come into play when this Authority is called forth. First, the user’s creativity will be elevated to top even the greatest of artists, for the purpose of designing what he chooses to create. Second, a set of tools shall appear, perfect for whatever creation the user wanted to make. Third, the user shall gain temporary knowledge of magic to enchant, curse or bless his creation as he had envisioned. Be it buildings, songs, weapons, armor or the likes, even with the worst materials something that borders the divine can be made.%%%%Downsides: The user must have something he wants to make before calling the Authority. The materials are not provided for this. Depending on the creation, the time spent making it will vary. Once a project has been started, the Authority won’t let another start until the first is done.,,
Will of Magic,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Chant: "The path of understanding existence and all its mysteries. For I hear the heartbeat of the world and feel its breath all around me. There is no limit to Magic nor can I be limited. For I am the Will of Magic itself."%%%%Effect: This [Authority] grants the user great talent and absolute understanding of all Magic he witnesses, including rituals and Magical items. Letting the user cast all kinds of spells with ease and even replicating ones that are restricted. This is a passive ability, just by observing any magical object, spell or ritual the user will be able to understand, replicate and even improve it on some level. This is supported with an almost instinctual ability to know what magic and spells are useful for them at the moment, whether that be a simple but powerful fireball, summoning a horde of undead soldiers or even creating Divine Beasts.%%%%Downsides: Replicating Authorities is possible, but comes to a great cost in mana, some being impossible to replicate unless the user has a gigantic mana pool. Chant is needed for more complex/powerful magics.,,
Drop In - Money, Money, Money,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,It makes the world go ‘round. Maybe not the fanciest of things, but certainly one with its uses. This is a monthly allowance of $50 000, changed into the currency of whatever country you are residing at the moment.,,
Drop In - Hot New Ride,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,You didn’t though I was going to let my favorite jumper without a car, right? This bad boy here is a new model that never runs out of gas, has insurance for all kind of damages, resist all kinds of crazy shit that can be thrown at it and never breaks down no matter how crazy you drive it. Also, chicks dig jumpers with cars.,,
Drop In - Eion,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Also called the Grimoire-Maker, this little carved stone works by stealing a great deal of divinity from its victim, sealing the power inside itself. Depending on who the divinity was stolen from, it may change its size and shape. You can later use it by breaking it and released a divine beast around or make a giant explosion. You could always learn to harness the power stolen in other ways, but it would certainly take some time to do so. It could be used in other beings outside Gods, with similar effects.,,
Drop In - Tome of Prometheus,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A Grimoire that has the power of Theft, granting it the ability to steal the Authorities of any God, to then be used by the Grimoire's wielder. However, if the stolen Authority is used by a normal human, the effect would be devastating, most likely killing them. This power is born from the myth of Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to grant it to humans and it requires that the user knows enough about the god whom they are trying to steal the power from.,,
Ordinary Student - Keep In Contact,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Made with the latest technology and with the quality of the old Nokia cellphones. This smartphone can survive virtually any amount of damage without breaking or malfunctioning, made to last, it also has good signal and a tremendous battery life and has been enchanted with powerful magics.,,
Ordinary Student - A Mirror Self,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sure, you aren’t a fighter here, but that doesn’t mean that you aren’t prepared and armed in case you ever need force to solve your problems. This little gift is a weapon tailored to your fighting style, with the bonus of amplifying a little your magic or authorities when you use it. With time and use, it will grow a little and adapt even better to you, increasing the bonus and becoming more comfortable in your hands.,,
Ordinary Student - Book of The Pagan Heroes,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,One of the few Grimoires written by human hands and that possess written spells and magic inside. It contains spells strong enough to harm Gods and Campiones, although mastering them may take a while. It was based in the myths and records of several god-slaying beings in pagan religions.,,
Ordinary Student - Fancy Chains,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,This is a plain-looking circlet imbued with Keeper of the Horses, a powerful ancient spell that allows the user to subdue an unruly god by placing it around their head. It will paralyze the god and seal off their divinity, making them as dangerous as a baby while the effect is on. The effects aren’t eternal and the circlet can be taken off by another under certain circumstances, but it can be used to gain advantage in some cases.,,
Knight Templar - Battle Garments,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Having to battle creatures from myth and legend as your job is no excuse to not look fashionable while doing so. This is a set of clothes that fit you perfectly, are fashionable, flexible, self-repairing and strong as enchanted steel armor. Because if you’re going to kick ass, then do it in style.,,
Knight Templar - Magical Weapon,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,All Knights are given their own weapons after they reach a certain level, sometimes they are forged and other times these are simply passed down from another knight. While these are usually swords, it's far from the norm and it means little when any adept knight can use magic to change the shape of their weapons. All magic weapons possess a certain amount of magic and one power granted from its enchantments and materials, these effects range from being able to self-repair, lift curses, negate magic, induce sleep or counter spells.,,
Knight Templar - Order of Jumper,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,While not exactly at the same level of the Copper Black Cross or the Bronze Black Cross, this Order of Knights is still a fearsome thing. Completely under your control, it boasts a small, but capable number of members as well as connections all over the magic world. It also possesses several enterprises to fund their activities and a number of relics and weapons to draw from. Despite this, it can only hold a modest number of new recruits at the time, unless you put your effort to expand the organization.,,
Knight Templar - Lance of Longinus,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The name is a bit of a misnomer, really. This weapon here has a curious ability, namely, its capable of penetrating all magical defenses as if they were paper as well as being able to target and damage the ‘soul’ of those in its path. For some this ability wouldn’t matter much, but the Authorities wielded by the Campiones are tied to their souls and a good hit from this blade could seriously cripple them. Aside from that, I’m sure you can see the uses of a weapon capable of striking souls and no sell magic.,,
Magic Scion - Library of Babel,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Perhaps a name too big for what it is, but its usefulness can’t be denied. This is a large library is a collection of myths, legends, fables and records about gods, angels, demons, heroes and other fantastical beings. It also recorded the cults for each and their transition in time and geography. As expected, it would take a long time to memorize it all, but is a good source of information if you happen to need it. It updates every jump.,,
Magic Scion - Dragon Corpse,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Also called Angel Remnants and such, Dragon Bones are what's left of Heretic Gods after they are slain. They are greatly sought after and can be used as a power boost or ingredient for advanced alchemy reagents. This is an assortment of such things, gathered during a large period of time. You can keep them and use them or just sell them for a neat profit.,,
Magic Scion - A Promise Unforgotten,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Geasses and contracts are curious things, not even the most powerful are free from their influence. While not an artifact by itself, this gift is still useful for those who value contacts over direct power. To put it simply, this is a favor owned by a powerful and resourceful God and lend to you by me, maybe you can exchange it for their assistance once or ask them for a powerful item in compensation. They will comply as long as it's in the realm of possibility for them to do it. I’ll give you one more each jump, leading to being of similar power and influence.,,
Magic Scion - Divine Blade,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A Divine ‘sword’ whose legend has grew enough to be considered a minor god or demigod all on its own. At its basest, it has the ability to empower its user, cut through spells, negate or penetrate magical effects and powers and lift or cancel curses. It also contains greater power than any magical weapon. You won’t need Advent Magic to use it. Depending on the weapon you choose and its legend, other effects and even Authorities may be used.,,
Heretic God - All The King’s Horses,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A godly being like you deserves a godly steed to travel, and while you may possess an Authority to do so already, another item may prove useful in some cases. For that, this legendary mount is yours to use. Able to break the speed of sound easily while protecting all passengers and possessing a small but effective amount of firepower to defend you when you need it. The exact aesthetic depends on you, maybe you want a flying horse or a small dragon or a vimana. Regardless, the specs will be the same.,,
Heretic God - Circle of the Illuminated,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Gods are meant to be worshiped, and worshiping is what you get here. This is a rather large cult of mages, scholars and others ‘in the know’ dedicated to your being. From crazy devoted fans to vaguely interested people, and maybe even a descendant of yours. They will follow your commands and act like a source of information and supplies for your cause, but few of them have any noteworthy talent, most being little more than average humans.,,
Heretic God - Scroll of the False Prophet,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Not really a scroll, to be honest with you, although it can take that form if you so desire. What I present to you here is a lesser copy of the Holy Grail, one that can mimic a particular function, if ever so altered. I’m talking about the Divine Ancestor creation ritual, which leads into turning things and beings into dragons. As you can guess, it has been modified, so it can turn even a normal human into the equivalent of a divine beast in power. While it has its uses as is, you can always apply yourself to understand better the ritual and modify it further.,,
Heretic God - Sacred Temple of the Gods,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,As one would expect of a God of your level. A temple between the Netherworld and the mortal realm. You can shape it as you want, following your favored aesthetic. While you are inside, your divinity and ‘will’ are increased in volume and control, letting you exert your influence far wider and boosting all your powers exponentially. It can also be used in reverse, if you will, hiding your divinity and presence from anyone trying to find your location and also grant a boost in regeneration while you’re inside resting.,,
Companion Import,,3,,00,,False,,False,,Even the greatest of parties can feel boring when you don’t have anyone to share the moment. Fear not, for there is a way for your old companions to appear here. For 100cp you can import a single companion with 600cp for their use, or fill the whole roaster of 8 for 400cp, again all of them gain 600cp for their expenses. If you are feeling really lonely, I will let you import all your companions for 600cp, they gain the same cp as the other options. Don’t let the party end.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,00,,False,,True,,So, you took a liking to someone here? I can’t say that I don’t understand. For 100cp you can take any mortal from this world as a companion, granted that they are still alive at the end. If you want someone more ‘exotic’ like a Campione or Heretic God, you can get them for 300cp each, they still need to be alive by the end. Don’t worry, I’ll push as much as possible and beyond to ensure a good relationship with you so they can be convinced.,,
Sworn Knight,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Drop In%%%%Perhaps as to be expected no sooner had you arrived you were swept up into a magic maelstrom originating from the humble taco cart you visited. The ensuing clash of magical communities, cults, and influences of divine beings shook the region to its core with you tumbling through the thick of it with her at your side. A scion of a long and noble line, she holds true to her origins as a modern aristocrat while being one of the most talented magic knights of this generation. Weaving through battlefields and ballrooms with aplomb she ended up pulling through it all only with unexpected help from you. Your actions have won the heart and loyalty of this mischievous little devil who has sworn herself to your cause. Loyal and efficient as any knight you could hope for, she still has her playful & clingy side she has no shame in declaring when it comes to you. Has the 'Magic of Mortals', 'Noble Retinue' and 'The Devil Wears Prada' perks.,,
Simply Divine,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Ordinary Student%%%%By the whims of providence, from the high heavens this heretic goddess has descended to give blessings to this wonderful jumper. For reasons unknown, this one in particular has lost much of their power during their descent with what they have left easily controlled to not cause as much chaos as would be expected. This lady was enjoying time in her myths when she saw you and fell in love as she fell to the mortal realm. Ignorant but curious of the modern world, she doesn't possess the morals of humans yet gives weight to your words even when she wouldn't listen to others. Bursts forth with surprising strength when it concerns you despite usually not being capable of it. Behind her godly demeanor and somewhat naive views hides minor yandere tendencies with a great talent for always knowing where her beloved is. She has the 'Fairytale princess', "Beyond Those wild dreams" and 'killer queen' perks,,
Teen Prodigy,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free Magic Scion%%%%Despite your focus in mystical beings from a young age, this girl has been your door to the mindset of the 'normal' folk. Lacking any sort of training in magical or most other fields, this airhead nevertheless has a striking luck paired with unbelievable instincts that allow her to breeze through things unrelated to academia. With an attitude brighter than the plus a head harder than a rock, she's the best friend you could ever ask for. With the correct training and time, she could rise high enough to shock the entire world. Despite this she seems more comfortable when wasting time playing with you, she recently started blushing when you two are alone together, wonder why? She has the 'sportsy normie', 'Around the corner' and 'those who would be kings' perks,,
Maid In Heaven,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Knight Templar%%%%All Knights require a squire, knowledge must be passed to the next generation and precious few solely teach. After being rejected countless times, she came to you where she offered to serve as a maid while her apprenticeship lasted. Soon you found out that she wasn't born for the world of magic, but her insistence won you over. What this little one lacks in magic talent she makes up in cunning and ability in the service fields, from housework to administration and the staple of maids everywhere, modern espionage. Sly and resourceful, she slowly made progress thanks to your guidance and for that she's eternally grateful. In fact, it seems that now she yearns for a deeper relationship with you, something more than teacher and student or even master and maid...although she is quite happy to keep the uniform on. She has the Could You Not, Are You Free This Weekend and The Magic of Mortals perks.,,
Obsessed Cultist,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free Heretic God%%%%Once a peerless historian with a bright future ahead of her, she stumbled upon the supernatural side of history and things spiraled out of control after that. Discovering her own disposition of a Miko she began training in witchcraft with one goal in mind, to bring her new God (and crush) to the mortal world. The fact that you are here as powerful as you are is in part thanks to her efforts. Boasting fighting ability that would lose to a child, she's an excellent witch nevertheless, charismatic and crafty enough to raise a large cult dedicated to you and your goals. Somewhat of a workaholic, she's a little ditzy but ruthlessly efficient when carrying out your will, she taking the initiative if she thinks it will help you in some way. A firm hand is needed on her overly enthusiastic reigns, or maybe you just want to keep going and see what happens? Comes with the Modern Myth, Family Traditions and Pinnacle of Magic perks.,,
The Jumper That Was...,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Congratulations, jumper! You’re now Kusanagi Goudou, gaining all his past history and connections without any of his natural perks. This may be useful for you... or maybe more trouble than it's worth. Whatever the case, I'll be watching and laughing.,,
Where Am I?,,4,,00,,False,,False,,How curious, things seem to be not quite as you remember them being. Goudou is now strange and eats a lot? He sent out Doni flying into the sky a minute after meeting? Liliana is his first knight? And what’s up with all those characters from other worlds? It seems you have landed in the universe of some fanfiction instead of the canon of the series...,,
Spoiler Alert,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Looks like this isn’t the first time you deal with Gods, Divine Beasts and Heroes. For those jumpers with an history alongside Divine beings, this will ‘correct’ the continuity so you can still enjoy or regret your past story with Heretic Gods and the like. Some may be confused by you, however, since your deeds may also be recorded in their history and legends.,,
Ordinary Days,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,All the Campione have some things in common, like their crazy luck or managing to slay a god. Aside from that, they all seem to share some kind of mania, like Doni’s lack of focus, Goudo’s obsession with ‘normality’ or Voban’s hard-on for hunting. Now you join their ranks in being a complete whacko. Feel free to choose your own mental issue, but rest assured that it will make people uncomfortable and cause more than one problem during your stay here.,,
Was That Supposed To Happen?,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Oh, so you thought you could do it here with either metaknowledge or the information you managed to gather here? Not the case, not the case at all. Taking this means that your information on people, events and the like will always be somewhat off. Well, it doesn’t matter much if you’re the type of idiot that likes to throw himself without previous information.,,
Fuck That Place,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Goddamnit, Jumper! Don’t you know how to hold back or something?! Because it surely doesn’t look like it. Everything you do ends up causing a great deal of collateral damage, even trying to cook will end up with a couple of houses burning down and trying to play a game may end up with the national bank’s data being wiped out. If you ever try to fight, you will make Goudo’s levels of collateral destruction feel inadequate. Of course, no one will be pleased with this, except maybe you.,,
The Undefeated Jumper of the East,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Looks like you have a fearsome reputation, jumper, one for being the hottest shit around. Too bad the only way you see that reflected is how challengers come to fight you in a regular basis. From the start, they will all be worthy and have something that makes them give a good battle. You can keep a toggle-able version post jump if you enjoy having a challenge battle every Saturday.,,
Hidden Desires,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Much like the protagonist of canon, you are a battle junkie in denial, your blood boils at the thought of fighting strong enemies, but you will also be against such. Some may think of you bipolar or something with how much you try to avoid battle at one moment just to start one at the next. Beware unconsciously giving your enemies another chance so you can get more battles, while trying to reason it as being merciful.,,
That Escalated Quickly,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Harem jumpers, when will they learn? It doesn’t matter if you wanted a harem or not, because now you have one, one made of the strongest and craftiest girls in this world, from Campiones to Heretic Goddesses and powerful witches. None very keen in the concept of personal space, none willing to take a ‘no’ for an answer and none willing to share you with anyone else. Have fun.,,
Living Magnet,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,So, you want to be the start of the play? It can be done. You’re now the N°1 in fate’s shit-list, or at least that’s what you’re going to think if you take this. No matter where you are or what are you doing, if things are going south, then its going to be near you. Prepare to go for a coffee and find a cult trying to call some Heretic God or try some vacations to find yourself in the middle of an all-out battle between Campiones. On the bright side, you won’t be bored.,,
Walk The Earth,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Your powers are leaking out of you and into the world around you. Even with perfect self-control of your magic and other powers will leave those nearby suffering from its effects everytime you use them, and I do mean suffering. Charisma perks? Everyone will slowly social fu themselves into a riot. Healing magic? Cancer for everyone. The stronger your powers, the stronger the reaction. This won’t affect your companions.,,
Extra-Ordinary,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,In a world where Gods, dragons and magic are as real as pizzas, you certainly don’t belong. You magic doesn’t work anymore and all items esoteric in nature just fail to work in your hands. It’s not like you gained some magic-nullifier, is just that magic itself rejects you, unless its working against you. Becoming a Campione won’t give you anything and you really shouldn’t take this as a Heretic God. Better start working in something more mundane.,,
Killing It,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Your arrival to this world disrupted things to a great degree, it’s not something that the normal folk would notice, but everyone and everything magical in this world notices it and they don’t like it one bit. For the duration of your stay here, all thing magical and people with powers will be inclined to hate you at sight. Perhaps you will be able to overcome this with a selected few, but they will always be inclined to dislike you at some level. Not even companions are exempt, but the effects will fade away after the jump ends.,,
The Story That Was Not,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Because of the problem the Heretic Gods meant to humanity, Pandora created the Campione system, giving a few selected mortals the means to constantly fight back. Except that now that isn’t the case. You see, taking this means that Pandora never made the Campiones, but the Heretic Gods running amok are still a thing and now humanity has very little means to defend themselves from the whims and desires of the Gods.,,
At The End of The World,,4,,8000,,False,,False,,The King Who Manifests at the World’s End is here and wants you dead. This is very bad, this is the strongest steel, the God that predates on Campiones and who appears at the end of an era. To make things worse, he has appeared at his strongest, bearing not only the powers he would normally wield, but also his full divinity as a God and empowered enough to kill all Campiones present at this time. It seems that your nature as a dimensional traveler tickles him something fierce. Be careful, he knows of all your powers and perks. On the flipside, if you manage to defeat him, a nifty Authority is awaiting you.,,
