Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You come to this world with no additional memories or connections.,,
Luxiat,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are one of the lore keeping priests of this world. You've spent many years in stacks of books ferreting out the secrets they contain. The ranks of clergy also give you access to what many others do not.,,
Soldier,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are a professional warrior, perhaps even one of the famed Black Guard. Either way you've spent at least a decade honing your self into an elite warrior. Soon your skills will be in high demand.,,
Noble,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are one of the blooded land owners of this world. You've spent much of your time vying for power, or at the very least keeping yourself being crushed underneath the other nobles who do.,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You can roll 1d8 for your starting location, or choose it for 50 CP.%%%%1. Atash: Home of the fair skinned and bright eyed Atashians, this is a land of many things. Skilled lens grinders and mirror makers, incredibly important in a land where light is power. Ironwood forests and cultivated fields of cotton, grain and other produce.%%%%2. Abornea: A land renown for it’s traders, and for staying neutral in prisms’ war. It earned them few friends. Despite their mountainous terrain, they’re well known for raising livestock, making cheese, and for fine woolen products.%%%%3. Ruthgar: The most wealthy and politically powerful of the seven satrapies, situated on the plains. They’re known for their olive skinned citizens, their horses and elephants and their once bloody rivalry with the blood forest before Gavin Guile put an end to it.%%%%4. Blood Forest: Home of fair skinned, red haired, and blue eyed folk, the blood forest lives up to it’s name. Home to massive creatures, and a small remaining number of the ever smiling pygmies as well. They’re famous for their lumber and longbows.%%%%5. Paria: A land of desert, ruled by dark skinned tribes and possibly the birth place Lucidonius, the first prism and therefor the birthplace of the current faith in Orholam as well. They are famed for their great warriors and their great faith in Orholam as well as their marble.%%%%6. Ilyta: Ilyta is famed for it’s mechanical works, textiles, firearms and craftsmanship in general, as well as the pirate kings that rule her. Most satrapies pay them a tribute to operate in their lands, and despite the numerous times the Chromeria destroyed them they, are immensely wealthy and powerful.%%%%7. Tyrea: A satrapy devastated by the prisms’ war, and then again by the occupation afterwards for the crime of siding with Dazen. The home of caramel skinned citizens is renown for it’s incredible fertility, and though most of the her fields have gone fallow, her crops where once the envy of the chromeria.%%%%8. Orholam smiles on you, indeed. You may start wherever you please in this world.,,
Super Chromat,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You can see the minutest difference in colors. When magic relies on the manipulation of such colors, this is quite useful. If you pass the test here: http://www.brentweeks.com/extras/quiz/ or have taken rank four sense from body mod then you can instead take it for free.,,
Drafter,,1,,00,,False,,True,,One purchase free for all. Additional purchases 50 CP - Roll 1d8 to see which kind of Luxin you can draft, or pay 50 CP to choose. If you buy more colors, you may re-roll duplicate results.%%%%You can wield the basic magic of this world. You can see any spectrum of light that you can draft, even those not normally visible.,,
Luxin,,1,,00,,False,,True,,When a candle burns, a physical substance, wax, is transformed into light. Chromaturgy is the inverse: A drafter transforms light into a physical substance called luxin. Each different color of luxin has its own strength, weight, and even smell. As a physical substance, shooting luxin out of one's body creates an opposite force, shooting the drafter away from their luxin.%%%%Luxins are physical substances converted from specific colors of light with in a drafter's body by a process called drafting. They can be expressed as gasses, liquids, or solids. Colors can only be drafted by seeing that particular color; staring at a white light will not let a normal drafter draft any of their colors, while staring at a green light would allow only green to be drafted.%%%%Once luxin is 'sealed' it can no longer be altered via drafting until it is 'unsealed' again. While luxin is 'open' it responds to the will of it's drafter, but if another drafter comes into contact with 'open' luxin, it can be 'will jacked' and slaved to the other drafter's will; if they can overcome the first drafter's will that is.%%%%But even as drafters change the world, the luxin changes them too, physically, mentally, and emotionally. A halo identical to the colors they draft forms in their iris, growing slowly as they draft luxin over the course of their lives. The emotional aspect of a drafters colors is minor, save when they are drafting or when the halo begins encroaching upon their sclera.%%%%Once the halo breaks and spreads into the sclera the drafter becomes a wight, losing their humanity and drifting ever deeper into the grip of their colors. Wights are killed on sight by members of the Chromeria. If you become a color wight it will count as you choosing to stay in this world. After the conclusion of your time here, your halo will not 'break' regardless of how much you draft.,,
Luxin - Superviolet,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Made of wavelengths shorter than most human eyes can see, super-violet luxin is invisible except to super-violet drafters—and those only when they concentrate. Solid, but not as strong as blue or green, super-violet is the subtlest luxin. Used for cryptography, creating invisible walls and traps, and marking targets on the battlefield, super-violets tend to have a removed outlook. They appreciate irony and sarcasm and are sometimes cold.,,
Luxin - Blue,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Blue Luxin is hard, strong, and smooth, but also inflexible. It can be used in anything from the creation of large structures to armor or bladed weapons or projectiles. The deepest blue is violet. Blues are orderly, inquisitive, and unfailingly rational. Structure, rules, and hierarchy are important to blues.,,
Luxin - Green,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Green Luxin is springy, flexible, and still pretty tough though not so much as blue luxin. The uses are as varied as the drafter is creative: from furniture to projectiles to shields to the throwing arms of war engines. Green luxin can also be used to speed up the growth of plant life. Greens are wild and free, despising restrictions placed upon them.,,
Luxin - Yellow,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Yellow Luxin is most often a liquid that releases its energy back into light quickly, allowing its use as a torch or a trigger to ignite flammable materials or explosives. Yellow nourishes other luxins, extending the durability of luxin structures or tools. Like water turning to ice, when yellow is drafted perfectly, it loses its liquidity and becomes the hardest luxin of all, though it is difficult to draft such quickly, and it is all but impossible for some one who isn't a superchromat to draft a perfect yellow luxin at all. Yellows tend to be clear thinkers, with intellect and emotion in perfect balance.,,
Luxin - Orange,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Orange luxin is slick, lubricative, and heavy. It is often used in conjunction with machines and traps. Orange drafters are also able to create hexes, altering others emotions, though the Chromeria has outlawed this practice. Oranges are often artists, brilliant in understanding other people’s emotions and motivations. Some use this to defy or exceed expectations. Others become master manipulators.,,
Luxin - Red,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Red luxin is sticky, gooey, and extremely flammable. Reds often work with sub-reds or with mundane tools to make bombs. Their skills are used to catastrophic effect in war. Reds are quick tempered, impulsive, lusty, and love destruction.,,
Luxin - Sub-Red,,1,,00,,False,,True,,By dilating their eyes fully Sub-Red drafters can see heat, allowing them to see in the dark. They can draft the heat from their surroundings to survive intense heat and create flame crystals which burst into fire when exposed to air. Sub-reds are passionate in all ways, the most purely emotional of all the drafters.,,
Luxin - Paryl,,1,,00,,False,,True,,By dilating the pupils so far that the whites of the eyes disappear drafters can see into paryl. Paryl resembles millimeter waves on the electromagnetic spectrum just as Sub Red resembles infrared. Paryl drafters have the ability to see through objects unless they are made of metal as paryl can pass through matter to a certain depth. Paryl is most commonly drafted in a gas, or a 'paryl torch', however it is possible to create a liquid or even a solid.%%%%Paryl is invisible to all but those who can draft it, and while it is the most fragile of the luxins it's said that assassins have formed clots of the delicate material within organs and blood vessels to kill with out leaving a trace. In keeping with the emotional spectrum paryl drafters have a very strong feeling of empathy towards others.,,
Luxin - Chi,,1,,00,,False,,True,,By constricting their pupils so far they become nearly invisible, a drafter can see chi. It is the highest energy of the luxins, giving it the longest range and allowing it’s drafters to see through clothes, flesh, and bone with ease. It’s uses medically should be obvious, as are it’s uses for communication. But so too can the high power luxin be used to destroy.%%%%Chi luxin can cause cancer, or simply cook what it passes through at greater intensities, and opening oneself up to it is enough to completely remove one’s smell. Chi drafters normally have incredibly short lifespans due to the cancerous effects of constantly taking their luxin within them- but as an additional gift from Orholam, you shall be made immune the negative effects of channeling chi if you purchase it here.,,
Drop In - Who?,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,A description of you: Maybe average height, attractive, no readily noticeable scars or tattoos. To complement your bland attractiveness you also know how to disguise yourself both as someone in particular and as merely unrecognizable to those who've already seen you. Fading into the background makes simple to escape the notice of enemies and allies alike.,,
Drop In - Eyes Unseen,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have the skill set of a professional thief assassin: how to move without making noise or being seen, how to slit a throat without staining yourself with blood, how to draft unobtrusively, how to pick locks and evade traps, as well as an impressive parkour skill set. Moving unseen and unheard will ease your way to where others wouldn’t want you to be.,,
Drop In - Order of the Broken Eye,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Order of the Broken Eye has gone unnoticed for centuries. But the effects of their actions have been felt around the world.%%%%You know how to create and maintain and effectively use such organizations- as well as how best to infiltrate and destroy them. You know who to blackmail, who to assassinate, and what to sabotage to achieve the effects you desire. So to will you know how to maintain secrecy, and most important of all, loyalty in any group you found or join.,,
Drop In - Light Splitter,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,A power most believe to solely belong to the Prism, you can draft a lot more luxin at once, draft any color from white light, use shimmer cloaks, and even be able to feel what color light touches your skin. You can also draft pretty damn near as much luxin as you want without breaking your halo.%%%%Comes with prismatic irises if you bought all the colors.%%%%You will still need to dilate or constrict your eyes for colors outside the visible spectrum, but other than that, and the need for light itself, there are no limits on your power.,,
Luxiat - Scholar,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have a perfect memory and can preform advanced mathematics in your head with ease. Talents in high demand within in the scholarly orders of the luxiats.%%%%Your superiors will also be quick to recognize your talents, so long as you don’t hide them, and give you duties and power that matches them.,,
Luxiat - Structural Drafting,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Unlike many you know how to create more permanent and complex structures out of your luxin. You have training on how to create buildings, war engines, and tools out of luxin with near perfect precision and grace, never using more than you must.%%%%In addition your luxin will not degrade over time, not breaking until enough force is brought to bear, whatever it's color.,,
Luxiat - Heretical Knowledge,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You've been granted access to all of the libraries at the chromeria, including those forbidden. You know how to use Luxin in many (extremely illegal) ways that have been lost to memory. How to make a solid paryls to assassinate others, how orange luxin can be used to manipulate other's minds, and how to graft luxin to your body to make it stronger to name a few. And unlike everyone else you know exactly what white and black luxin do.%%%%Be careful with showing these skills off though; the price for being caught using them is death.%%%%In later jumps you'll find illegal knowledge much more easily than you really should, it sometimes seeming to just drop into your lap.,,
Luxiat - White Luxin,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,A legendary form of luxin, and said to be the raw word of Orholam himself, white luxin hasn’t been seen any many, many years. And thanks to the luxors, knowledge of it’s uses have been removed from all over the satrapies. But you now can draft it.%%%%There is no force great enough to break it. There is no wound it can’t make whole. It can be used to regrow limbs and organs, or renew them. It can also be used to grant any power it’d drafter possess to those it touches.%%%%White luxin appears as an opalescent white.,,
Soldier - Discipline,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You are a slab of springy muscle placing you at the limits of human ability in all physical categories.%%%%You're also now ambidextrous.%%%%Anyone looking at you knows it as well- there are few willing to cross you, and never lightly.%%%%Your physical abilities will never degrade either, in spite of your lifestyle.,,
Soldier - Black Guard Training,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have received training functionally identical to what the most elite fighting force in the world, the Black Guard, go through. You are an elite soldier, able to use any drafting abilities you have efficiently in battle as well as being a master at fighting unarmed and with a large variety of weaponry. You are also taught advanced counter assassination techniques; noticing tails and ambushes and doing these activities yourself both become natural to you.,,
Soldier - True Name Will, You See,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are crazy in one particularly useful way: you believe you can do anything. While you can't, the absolute certainty of your belief in yourself gives you a will so hard it can make gods weep like children. This increases the raw strength and ability of your drafting to absurd levels; you could shoot green luxin into granite with little effort. Wielding sea demon bone weaponry is perfectly safe for you; your will is literally unbreakable.%%%%Outside of your drafting ability your focus will also let you resist temptation and ignore pain and fear with casual ease no matter it's severity.,,
Soldier - Black Luxin,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,A void. Far darker than any mere lack of light, and endlessly hungry. It is a terrible thing, able to absorb and devour anything it comes into contact with, save white luxin. The magic it devours, it grants to it’s drafter. Many a drafter born with only the ability to draft the black has become a prism.%%%%You now have the ability to draft the dreaded black luxin.,,
Noble - Charming, I'm Sure,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,When you speak, people listen, and they like what they hear. Most people will like you unless they have reason not to, and with effort you can even win over even them. Those who actively hate you however may still laugh at your jokes, but at the end of the day they'll still hate you.%%%%As a bonus you can speak publicly with out a trace of stage fright.,,
Noble - Laws for the Weak, Laws for the Powerful,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You get away with things you really shouldn't. Sometimes it's by lying your ass off, sometimes through force of personality, sometimes with bribes.%%%%You can expect to get away with more or less anything unless they have indisputable evidence it was you, and even then...%%%%With a little effort, evidence can disappear. Witnesses can change testimony. Others will disbelieve that you've committed a crime unless they personally seen indisputable evidence of it.,,
Noble - Magnificant Bastard,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Drafters control light to get what they want done; you control people to get what you want done. You can set up plans so that even if they fail you still claim some kind of victory. Others leap at the chance to serve you with out even knowing that they are, and you are also a consummate liar.%%%%You are also a god tier strategist and tactician to complement your god tier ability to manipulate.%%%%You are also very skilled at card games for some reason; including ones you haven't played or even heard of.,,
Noble - Seer,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Many have claimed to have sight beyond sight. To see the future, the past. Most of them are grifters and madmen. But you have these abilities in truth.%%%%By opening yourself to Orholam’s light, you can see everything light has touched, touches, or will touch. Only that which is hidden from precognitive abilities is hid to you.%%%%The past is set in stone, as is the present, but the future you see is possibility, and what is needed to be done to change it.%%%%The only thing you need to operate your ability as seer are light and focus.%%%%Additionally, other people will know you speak the truth when you will it.,,
Worthy of Trust,,3,,00,,False,,False,,50 CP each, 200 CP for eight%%%%Someone you get along with and can trust with a free background, color, and 600 CP to spend. Can be a new buddy or an import from a previous jump. They may take any drawbacks worth +200 CP or less, up to a max of +600 CP.,,
I Hold You in My Sight,,3,,00,,False,,False,,100 CP, can be purchased four times%%%%You don't forget about your friends. Each purchase gives all companions imported or created in this jump another 100 CP to spend.,,
What's This about Hopping?,,3,,00,,False,,True,,50 CP each%%%%A character from canon of your choice will become your companion, or will if you can convince them to do so that is.,,
Items,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Anything stolen, used up, or broken will find it’s way back to you in perfect condition and completely full within a day unless otherwise noted. You can import any weapon of a fitting type into an item selection here, gaining it’s properties in addition to what it already had. A gun for a gun, a melee weapon for a melee weapon, etc.,,
Cash Money,,2,,00,,False,,True,,50 CP, three purchases free Noble, one purchase free Soldier%%%%Enough cash to let you live comfortable for your ten year stay. Additional purchases increase your economic class. One is equivalent to middle class, the next would be upper-middle class, the next would make you truly wealthy, the next would be fabulously rich, the last would make you one of, if not the, most wealthy person in the world.,,
Colour Glasses,,2,,00,,False,,True,,50 CP, free for drafter of the same color, with the exception of Paryl, Sub-Red, Chi, and Super-Violet%%%%These glasses stain all light you see in the appropriate color. They allow you to draft despite whatever colors happen to be around you.,,
Paryl, Chi, Sub-Red, or Super-Violet Color Glasses,,2,,00,,False,,True,,100 CP, discount for drafters of that color%%%%These glasses stain all light you see in the appropriate color. They allow you to draft despite whatever colors happen to be around you. Sub-Red is infra-red, and Paryl is basically micro waves, and chi x-rays for simplicity's sake.%%%%Yes, you can see in the normal visible spectrum of light at the same time. They're more expensive as the means to make them have been lost.,,
Colour Glasses Schematics,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Discount Drop In and Luxiat%%%%You know how to create glasses in all the colors. All of them. The entire spectrum of light from micro waves to x-rays. You can even make sets that cover the whole spectrum if you will it, a technology never seen in this world.,,
Evil Eye,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A jewel of luxin that can replace or infuse eyes, this has a simple and straight forward ability. It allows you to see the immediate future, and judges the likely hood of success any action you take has, though only for a few seconds into the future. Can you parry that attack? Will you be shot if you stay still, or move? Will they believe it if you lie?%%%%It can also tell you when another lies to you, though not the nature of the lie they tell, and certainly not the truth or if they’re mistaken. If they say there are a hundred men ten leagues ahead of you, you will know if the statement is a lie. Though whether it’s because they’re behind you instead, there’s only ten, there’s a thousand, there’s none, or they’re women, well... that’s up to you to find out. It can only inform you when you’re being lied to, and on matters of the immediate future.,,
Soldier - Basic Arms and Armour,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,A basic steel melee weapon of your choice, a black powder fire arm of your choice along with ammo, and a set of leather armor. Nothing fancy, but most professional soldiers have the equivalent of this- or worse.,,
Soldier - Ilytian Firearm,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A finely made black powder firearm from Ilyta. It's unlikely to misfire and quite accurate at range for a black powder weapon. These are the finest weapons mortal smiths have made in this world for centuries at the least, and arguably ever.,,
Soldier - Ilytian Mail,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A fine suit of mail that is so light you can swim in it, but will still protect you from all but the most terrible of blows. It costs more than modest house, and is extremely comfortable.,,
Soldier - Sea Demon Bone Weapon,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sea demon bones are the only physical material that react to will.%%%%This weapon will bend and harden and move as you see fit, but if it's broken when your will is in it, it will at the very least stun you.%%%%If you've invested all your will in it and it is broken it will break your mind.%%%%Default is a spear, but other possible forms maybe. Some alternate forms dangerous as as all hell without True Name Will, You See.%%%%If you do have it then you can make use of whatever the hell you want with it and be perfectly safe.,,
Soldier - Mirror Armour,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Mirror armor is suit of full plate, polished so bright that it can be used as a mirror. It helps diffuse incoming luxin, and unless it’s backed up by a truly terrible will, it can even result in it be dissipated harmlessly. It’s also proof against nearly any weapon save for a firearm at point blank or a very lucky strike. A normal suit is wildly expensive, grows less capable as the grime of battle mars it’s polish, and is quite noisy. You do not have a normal suit.%%%%While you still have the mirror bright plates, they’ve been will cast to remain clean, and to send any magic which strikes it back at it’s caster, though a titanic will can still over come it. The armor has been heavily reinforced with yellow luxin to make it light and strong beyond belief, and green to keep it from effecting your mobility or creating noise in the least. The luxin is will cast to keep you at a comfortable temperature in any environment short of at inside an arctic sea or lava flow, and it has been master crafted specifically for your body making it so comfortable to wear you could easily forget you’re in armor at all.%%%%The visor has been fitted with tiny disks of luxin and glass, ensuring you always have a source of any color you can draft, equivalent of you wearing the proper color of glasses.,,
Soldier - Judgment,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A terrible demon, Abaddon, once spent weeks of his time making a pistol. It is a terrible weapon: perfectly accurate, semi automatic, and never needing to be cleaned, reloaded or cared for in anyway. But what makes it a truly dreadful weapon is that it banishes any immortal slain by it’s shot from the world it’s fired in permanently. This is not that terrible weapon, named Comfort.%%%%This weapon is named Judgment, and it’s a far more terrible weapon than Comfort.%%%%Made from opalescent white and void black luxins, then blessed by an immortal, Judgement is an unbreakable firearm designed to your specifications that can be reshaped as you will over the course of a few minutes.%%%%The projectiles it fires are infused with the same, unbreakable and all devouring luxins so that which it strikes is slain, immortal or not, so long as it’s wounds are grievous enough. And even glancing wounds will damage ones ability to use magic and sap their strength. Like Comfort, Judgment needs neither care nor ammunition, and it grows more powerful with it’s wielder’s will and magic.%%%%As each and every shot can be filled with it’s wielder’s will, as it is luxin infused, it can easily strike targets even in normally impossible conditions.%%%%If lost or stolen, it will find it’s way back to your hand inside of half a minute.,,
Drop In - Atasifusta Grove,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Atasifusta is a tree, effectively extinct within the seven satrapies. It was doomed due to how useful they are. Atasifusta burns hot, even when wet, and a branch can burn nearly indefinitely if it’s not smothered. Years and years. Atasifusta is wildly effective as a fire-starter, making it invaluable in war. Sawdust can be used as a far more efficient form of firearm propellant than mere black powder as well. It is also ruinously expensive. You’re provided with a grove of over a thousand trees, which will regrow within a year and a day if they’re felled and are guaranteed never to be victim of a forest fire. Your grove can be placed within the world at a place of your choosing, upon one of your properties, or as an add on to your warehouse as you please.,,
Drop In - Perfect Shimmer Cloak,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A perfect shimmer cloak, crafted from the cured hides of immortals: it renders you invisible in every spectrum of light, can change it's color and shape at will, and it also prevents those with supernatural senses, such as precognition, from perceiving you with them, and making you aware of all who currently see you.%%%%It is oddly difficult to damage, offering protection and durability roughly equivalent to a suit of Ilytian Mail, if it is damaged it will regenerate over the course of half an hour.%%%%Normally it would only function when worn by a light splitter, but yours doesn’t have that limitation. If you are a light splitter however, you will know what color lights touch it’s surface, and even be able to feel who is using magic in a short range around you.,,
Noble - True Nine Kings Deck,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A deck of cards detailing the people, places, events, and things that will change the shape of the world in the time you are there.%%%%By drafting and touching a card you can experience that which the card depicts as if you were there. The entirety of the card's depiction's past is there as well as a useful smattering of it's future.%%%%You experience it as the person it depicts if it depicts a person. It's useful for finding out how other think, finding out which events you can or should disrupt, and the black mail potential is out of this world though there are, of course, other usages.%%%%You get a new, relevant deck every time you go to a new world filled with the most important items, people, and places there.,,
Luxiat - Books,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Books of basic drafting techniques and knowledge of the Chromeria. It'll help someone pick up the basics of this world at least. And outside the chromeria, such tomes are quite rare.,,
Luxiat - Weapon of Surrender,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A melee weapon made of both opalescent white and void black luxin, whose form can be changed as you will over the course of a few minutes. This is an item of old, it’s white not sleeping despite Vician’s sin, and responsive to your will; it renders your judgment instead of Orholam’s.%%%%Those stabbed by it are drained of luxin build up, renewing their halos. This luxin can then be used to give that ability to draft it to others. As you will, it can also take one’s ability to see colors for the same effect, and can kill and save as you please.%%%%It can even be used to harvest other mystical abilities, as you will.%%%%And as it is filled with black luxin, that which it strikes is slain, immortal or not, so long as it’s wounds are grievous enough.%%%%And even glancing wounds will damage ones ability to use magic and sap their strength.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Take as many as you'd like. You may not receive anymore than 1000 extra CP though. If you would, reduce that amount to +1000 CP. Unless you take Rage of the Fallen. The cap then extends to +2000.,,
Lard,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are fat, and the only way to get rid of it is with standard normal people abilities: eating less and exorcising more. Any attempt to lose weight in any other way will fail. Being considered chubby instead of obese is at the very least months away.,,
Barstard,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You were born illegitimately and people will look down on you for it. You're never going to get into the cool kid's parties.,,
Sub Chromat,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are color blind. Roll for it on the same list of colors that you draft. Not only are you discriminated against for this, you will also be rendered unable to draft any color you roll this way until your ten years are up.,,
Discipulus,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You're still in training, probably at the Chromeria. You don't know how to use your abilities as you would normally.%%%%Assume anything you buy is merely an amazing talent; one that has yet to be honed into skill.%%%%Taking this reduces your age by a third.,,
No-Con,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You are deeply ashamed of yourself. It will take at least a couple years of near constant success before you can look at yourself in the mirror. This can be somewhat shortened by encouragement from others and drastically lengthened by insults from others. This effects your abilities very negatively; you'll be at about half function until you get over it.,,
The Lip,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You have no filter twixt your mind and mouth. You're consistent brutal honesty and glibness is going to get you in a lot of trouble.,,
Slave,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You're ears were clipped, and you have little chance as being recognized as a person from this point on. Unless you find someway to pay your slave price (which is immense for a drafter) escaping will just lead you to being taken as a slave again somewhere else.%%%%You may only use money you actively earn in jump to buy out your slave price.,,
Press-Ganged,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You were press-ganged into either the color prince's army or the Satrap's. You'll have to fight in every major battle in this war and there is no way out of it. Hope you don't get hit with a stray bullet or something.,,
Guile,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You're a Guile now. Andross knows. Koios knows. These two immensely powerful men have plans for you, plans that will tear the world apart, and quite likely you along with it. Have fun with that.,,
Andross's Pawn,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Andross Guile the Red, the Spider, the immoral, has a method of controlling you. You can't kill him or escape his control. Life's gonna suck. If bought with slavery he literally owns you to boot. He will force you to compromise your honor in order to expand his own power base, and the risks to your life will be consistent and significant.%%%%If he dies, or his power is broken, you fail your chain.,,
Seven Trials, Seven Penances,,4,,3000,,False,,True,,You have committed great sins. Wrath. Lust. Pride. Greed. Envy. Sloth. Gluttony. You’ve committed them all, and now you must pay the price. You must redeem yourself.%%%%First step is to relive these moments, every last one where you’ve committed such things in agonizing detail.
