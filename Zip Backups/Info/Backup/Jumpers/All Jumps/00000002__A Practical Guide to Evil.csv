Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Foundling,,0,,00,,False,,False,,No family, no records, no history... well, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were an orphan. But no records? With the Imperial orphanages, even they have those nowadays. Perhaps you can sign yourself into one and go about arranging for the papers? It's amazing how much you can be denied by the Praesi without them.,,
Callowan,,0,,00,,False,,False,,One of the conquered, fate has not treated you kindly, has it? Your homeland crushed beneath the heels of the invaders, a country of Good, bound to the whims of Evil? Sure, there are some traitors who would say that the life of a peasant is better beneath the whips of the vile Praesi slavemasters, but you know better. Your country cries out for revolution! To throw off the shackles of Praesi oppression! All you need is a Hero! Of course, maybe you could claim such a Role yourself...,,
Legionnaire,,0,,00,,False,,False,,A Legionnaire are you? And proud of it too! Surely, you've joined up only after the Reforms. Though before them the legions would never risk fighting the Callowan cavalry with any numbers less than four for every knight, in the modern day, it's the cavalry that break when met on an equal field, and the training that has brought the legions to that level will serve you well.,,
Praesi Noble,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Oh? So you call the Tower your home? Striving for the seat of Empress, I suppose? Your knowledge of politics will serve you well in the days to come, and your status as a native means that none will look down on you... for that at least. They're Praesi, I'm sure they'll try to find another reason. Make sure not to give them one.,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You may pay 100 CP to change your starting location.%%%%%%The Tower: The heart of the Dread Empire of Praes, the Tower is home to all sorts of insanity. The Dread Emperors were not the most stable of people, you see. Fortunately, you rarely need to make use of any but the 24'th floor, where the Dread Empress holds her court.%%%%The War College: Where the Legions learn the arts of War, few come unless it's to enlist. You are here to enlist, aren't you? If not, I suggest scurrying off, Lord Black is not fond of spies.%%%%Laure: A city in Callow, it's here that Lord Black will give a young orphan a knife, and it's here that an Imperial governor is about to be executed. It's here that a Story is about to begin. Guide it or let it be, the choice is yours.%%%%The Wall: Held for near 500 years before the Conquest, even now, it stands steady. As it's crewed by Imperials instead of Callowans, it's location between the two countries means that there's quite a bit of travel moving through here.%%%%Procer: The Free Cities, and home to the Princes, Procer is one of the remaining bastions of Good... even if it has an annoying tendency to fall into civil wars. Unfortunately, it's spending much of its time holding the North against the Kingdom of the Dead, which every so often takes a swipe at it.%%%%Kingdom of the Dead: ... This is... not the nicest of places to be if you're alive. As in, it's filled with undead which will be all too happy to add you to their number. Might I suggest leaving? Soonish? I hear Procer is nice this time of year.%%%%The Lands Below: What, exactly, are you doing in the lands of the dwarves? Why would you even want to be there? As far as they're concerned, only dwarves can hold property, so if you don't leave right now, you're probably going to get mugged.%%%%Free Choice: It appears destiny has favored you. Choose any location above.,,
Foundling - Turn of Destiny,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Destiny is a strange thing. Harsh and unbending, but easily guided. A thing you have a talent for.%%%%You will find that you are capable of redirecting destiny as you must.%%%%Though a death curse may be lain upon you, or a blessing upon your foe, you can bend Fate, redirecting the effects of the curse or blessing, that perhaps your foes will be struck by your curse, or your allies blessed by the luck that your opponent would have gained. Be careful, however.%%%%Too strong a curse, and you may find yourself struck by its collateral damage, and too many, and you may find it difficult to direct them as you intend.,,
Foundling - Hit Them With the Box?,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Powers are such odd things, aren't they? Especially those granted by a Name.%%%%You, however, are good at cutting through their obtrusive nature, and reducing them to their most fundamental nature, then adapting that nature to better use.%%%%Whether using this to abuse your knowledge of warding to break the wards that make up the very walls of Creation and drop a meteor on your foe, or just using your name to necromantically reanimate goats, stuff them full of explosives, and use the volatile reaction between your name and alchemy to create unusually large explosions, you'll find that any powers you have, you are absurdly good at abusing.,,
Foundling - The Only Choice that Matters?,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It is the gift of the gods that all mortals are born free. However, in the end, every mortal is offered a Choice. To side with Good, or to side with Evil. Some may falter when they see what they lose to that choice. You do not.%%%%The Choice of Good and Evil is not the choice of Necromancy or Healing to you, and you will find that even as you have sunken into the depths of Evil, you can draw upon the light of Good, or that as Good bolsters you, you can reach into the necromancy of Evil.%%%%Never will calling upon a power taint your will; you have made your Choice and nothing can change that.,,
Foundling - Namer,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Roles. The sign of the gods within creation. Each granted a Name and three Aspects, a Name is a mantle of power, flowing from one potential bearer to the next, and guiding them toward their Fate. A Role is born from belief, from the ruts worn into creation when a story is told again and again, and a Name is a place in the story that is told, a sign that one has adopted their Role. Of course, as in all things, how something normally occurs is not how it must always occur.%%%%With this you find that you have the talent to form these Roles, and bind to them a Name. By telling stories, you can begin weaving the threads of destiny around someone, forging a Name that will remain within the world you reside in.%%%%Although you may designate the first to bear it, and create up to three, broad, conditions for who shall gain it next, thus designating the Role it will play, a Name is bound to the world, not its bearer, and if its bearer dies, the Name shall flow onward with no more guidance than that woven into it when it was first forged.%%%%Forging a new Name and Role will take you six months, three if you devote your entire attention to it.,,
Callowan - Chosen Hero,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,To be chosen by fate, to be the hero of the tale... isn't it a wondrous thing? Choose a single weapon. Your skills with it are second to none, allowing you to take on three opponents at once, and emerge the victor... even before your Name steps in to boost your strength.%%%%With its might behind you, you could walk through an army unscathed, leaving nothing but corpses in your wake... assuming, of course, you had a combat-focused Name.,,
Callowan - Hero's Training,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You. You embody the reason Lord Black hates heroes. Fate will bend to accelerate your teaching. Somehow, you learn far faster than you should, learning in days what any reasonable person would require months to learn, and when given a Great Evil to oppose, learn even faster, learning a year's worth in the same time.,,
Callowan - Magic of the Light,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Gods above have granted a powerful magic upon their chosen. Holy magic, the magic of light, healing, and protection. This is the magic of Heroes.%%%%It's small scale, better suited to strengthening the one who bears it than to massive acts of destruction, but do not think the second is impossible for those who call upon it. This divine strength has other benefits, however.%%%%You have been trained in these arts for five years, and you will find your spells more difficult to disrupt, even to the point that a Demon of Corruption cannot twist them away from you.,,
Callowan - The Power of a Story,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Fate is a fickle thing. Do you truly wish to rely upon it? Very well, so be it. The power of stories flows through you, and you are able to invoke it upon the situations you come across, even when you have left this world.%%%%You may twist the world to follow the tales you have woven, the paths burned into Creation itself.%%%%For example, if you challenge a foe twice, the first time forcing him to flee, and the second meeting him as an equal, then you shall be guaranteed to survive until your third conflict. At that conflict, however, he shall defeat you, no matter how fate must twist and bend to guarantee it. A last-moment burst of strength, a spell learned in a day where others would take years, whatever is needed, he shall achieve it... within limits.%%%%You see, in the end, it is the Choices that matter, not the stories. If in the end, even with that gift, he cannot claim victory, then he will fall no matter what the story says, delegated to a lesser role than he should have had. A further boon shall be granted upon you; that he shall only gain power in proportion with how much you call upon this power. If you are saved thrice from certain death, then he shall match you. Four times, and you shall be at the disadvantage. But if you do not call upon it even once, then he will have no strength but that he gained himself.%%%%Of course, this is not the only tale you can weave.%%%%Other tales can be woven just as well, a sword stuck in a stone, a crown found by a child... but whatever the tale, Destiny shall force it across it's path, and punish those who attempt to deviate from it.%%%%A final warning, however. This is not absolute in either direction. Push a story too far, and Fate may decide that the story simply isn't worth keeping around. Defeat your foe, even while unmatched, and that will be that, or push the tale too far, and you may find yourself slain by a â€˜greater' threat for your recent rival.%%%%%%%%This lets you create a story trope, and destiny will intervene to make sure it happens, then punish anyone who acts against it. The weaknesses are these:%%%%First, the story will backlash you when it ends.%%%%Second, the destiny can be broken through sheer stubbornness.%%%%Third, people can manipulate it.,,
Legionnaire - Legion Trained,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,One Sin. Defeat. One Grace. Victory. These are the words that every member of the Legion lives by. You've been trained in the legions, and are proficient with rank-to-rank fighting with the gladius and scutum, the usage of goblin munitions, and mass spellcasting (assuming, of course, that you're capable of spellcasting).%%%%Furthermore, you know how to create goblin munitions, including the magic-eating goblinfire.%%%%While this won't let you stand up to a Hero on it's own, the discipline of a legionnaire and their skill against others on their level is not to be doubted. As one of the Named yourself? Well, this level of skill can be quite effective, though it's enhanced with the assistance of fellow warriors.,,
Legionnaire - Quartermastery,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,An army, like a snake, moves on it's stomach. You're now capable of keeping even the largest of armies fed through pure logistics skill alone, and are capable of planning supply lines and other such necessities for militaries with little issue.,,
Legionnaire - Legion Spellcaster,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Unlike Praesi demon summoners, or callowan light casters, you're trained in the magic of the legions. Simple, fast, and easy, your training is geared toward magic that you can simply throw at your foes. Sure, you might not be as flexible as anyone else... but why do you care? While they're fumbling for which exact spell will deal with a situation, you'll be able to throw out ten that are simply â€œgood enough."%%%%You've been drilled in these magics for five years, and your spells are faster and more efficient.,,
Legionnaire - Deconstruction,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Do you know the worst part of being a Villain? Not knowing you're going to lose, no. It's that the Heroes didn't deserve to win. If the heroes deserved their victories, perhaps you could make peace with it. But they don't, do they? That's always the way of it. At the last moment they're taught a secret spell by a dead man, or your mortal weakness is revealed to them or they somehow manage to master a power in a day that would take a villain twenty years to learn. You loath it. And so you do not permit it.%%%%In any situation that your existence would be relevant, the plot armor of your enemies simply fails as you force realism upon the world, and force it to equalize. Morality, last second burst of strength, plot armor, all of that means nothing to you. There will be no mysterious mentors teaching your foes your one weakness, no absolute willpower that keeps them moving after you've killed them, no training sessions that grant them years of growth in a day... no.%%%%They will meet you alone and armed only with what they have earned.,,
Praesi Noble - Praesi Rituals,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You're a master of etiquette, able to flatter someone you loathe, and dance through the thousands of rituals that cover the Dread Empire without having someone drive a knife through your back.%%%%Further, you'll find yourself able to learn new rules of etiquette within only moments of observation.%%%%Only be rude if you want to.,,
Praesi Noble - Tower Politics,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,If one were to compare the Tower that holds the nobles of Praes to a pit of vipers, it would be the Tower that would come out looking worse. Vipers need a reason to bite, after all, while a Praesi noble will drive a dagger into your back, kick you into a pit full of alligators, and feed your soul to a demon just because she can. Fortunately, you're quite used to dealing with them.%%%%Your skills at politics and spying are second to none, letting you hold your own in a court that considers betrayal to be standard procedure.,,
Praesi Noble - Blood, Death, and Demons?,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Blood magic, necromancy, and demon summoning. What fun. The magics of Praes are dark ones, appropriate to those in service to the Gods Below.%%%%Your knowledge of the ritual magic of Villains is amazing, allowing you to bleed out a few prisoners in order to keep a massive area growing bountiful food, letting you call powerful demons with little risk to yourself, or forge powerful pacts with the greatest among them, allowing you to singlehandedly turn the flow of entire battles.%%%%You have five years of training in these magics, and your spells are stronger, and can grow stronger still with sacrifices, either of blood, or of your own defenses.,,
Praesi Noble - Praesi Engineering,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,If there is one thing that every Praesi Emperor has in common, it's the ability to take insane and ridiculous ideas and turn them into reality. Flying cathedrals that rain death upon their foes? Sentient tigers? Man eating tapirs? Giant cliffs to throw the hero down? WHY THE HELL NOT!%%%%You are capable of taking even the stupid and most insane engineering designs and throwing large amounts of magic at them until they work. Sure, this might require sacrificing a few towns worth of peasants, but that's the sort of thing that peasants are for.,,
Party of Heroes / The Calamities,,3,,00,,False,,False,,You may import a companion for 50 CP. They will receive a free Background and 600 CP to spend, but will not be Named unless you pay an additional 50 CP per companion. If you do, they will also gain the allowance of AP to purchase their Aspects. If you wish, you may import all 8 for 200 or 400 CP respectively.,,
Recruitment,,3,,00,,False,,True,,If you wish, you may attempt to convince a local to join you upon your journey.%%%%For 100 CP, you may attempt to recruit any local who does not have a Name.%%%%For 200, you may recruit a local who does have a Name.%%%%If the local agrees, they will join you as a companion on your journey.,,
Foundling - Zombie,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A horse, animated by what I assure you is the vilest necromancy. It will obey no orders but your own, no matter what enchantments your foes attempt to weave around it.,,
Foundling - Suicide Goats,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A tribe of goats, slain, emptied, then stuffed full of goblin munitions before being reanimated as zombies, I can't imagine what you'd do with these. Surely, there's no practical purpose for a tribe of explosive undead goats, right? You'll get another goat every morning.,,
Foundling - Story Teller's Aid,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A book of children's stories of every culture, containing both the tales and the various narrative structures which guide them.%%%%Further, it lists the impacts these stories have had upon the cultures that tell them, and contains summaries containing any and all similarities.%%%%Finally, if you write even the barest hint of a story into the end of it, it will give you a list of paths that story might take if it were to follow the narrative tropes of each culture. Though at first, this may seem rather useless, in a world driven by tales, the use of such a thing is not to be underestimated.,,
Callowan - Sands of Deception,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,... It’s sand. It’s literally just sand. That’s the deception. Weirdly though, people will always fall for it, especially if you shout “THE SANDS OF DECEPTION!” as you throw it into their faces.%%%%Perfect for distracting everyone while you run away.%%%%Comes in a nifty pouch the size of a mango when full. It refills every morning. Or you could just fill it manually, if you’d like.%%%%The distraction effect will only occur if it’s filled with sand though.,,
Callowan - Infinite Bag,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Okay, so it’s technically not infinite. It can still hold enough alcohol to make a brewery’s yearly output do a double-take, as well as a fleet of ships. As in you can literally shove a bunch of warships into the bag and carry them around. The bag will not increase in weight at all, no matter what you put into it.,,
Callowan - Penitent’s Blade,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A feather of an angel of contrition, this blade will cut through nearly anything.%%%%Further, if stabbed into a stone and used in a ritual you know which takes 49 hours, it will call down an angel of contrition upon Creation, who will then strike the minds of everyone within 49 miles with their every sin. No mortal in history without a Name has been able to experience this and not turn toward Good, driven into a mad desire to make up for every Evil, no matter how small, that they have ever committed, and forming the tip of the spear of a new Crusade.%%%%If you wish, you may bind this feather to a weapon you already own, adding these abilities to that weapon.,,
Legionnaire - Goblin Metal,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Plate armor, a gladis, and a scutum. The arms and armor you’ve been given for joining the Legion, goblin metal is high quality, slightly better than common steel, giving swords that few others can match.,,
Legionnaire - Goblin Munitions,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A set of goblin munitions, enough for a standard match at the War College.%%%%Interestingly, the bags that come with these munitions refill every night.%%%%You should probably avoid using these during formal matches, but on the actual battlefield... well, not having to requisition munitions can be quite helpful.,,
Legionnaire - Mage Tower,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,An immense tower imbued with such heavy spellwork and defenses that even a fortress would grow jealous, this serves as the perfect home for a mage. So perfect in fact, that they’ve been outlawed simply due to how many mages have attempted to springboard their rebellions from them. You may choose where your Tower is placed at the start of each jump, and may add this to another property you own, if you wish.,,
Praesi Noble - Courtly Poisons,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A set of fifteen non-lethal but highly embarrassing poisons and their antidotes, perfect for throwing a party! After all, anyone who can’t find out what poisons are going to be in use in advance clearly has no place being invited to one of your social gatherings.,,
Praesi Noble - The Empress’s Garments,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A beautiful dress (or suit), with impressive spellwork woven in. While none of the spells are defensive, all of them will draw attention to your best features and away from your worst, as well as enhancing your silver tongue. Even an ugly oaf would look halfway adequate in this. Of course, the effects only grow stronger the more charismatic and beautiful you are without it’s help.,,
Praesi Noble - Egg,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A rather... understated name. This “egg” is actually a powerful artifact, holding within it a Demon from the 13th layer of Hell. Anything that demon touches will be slowly corrupted, twisted in both mind and flesh until there’s nothing left of the being it once was.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Maximum of 600 CP,,
Tropebound,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Creation is filled with roles, with a way that things are inclined to go. You will find it difficult to fight these paths, instead having yourself forced into specific roles, such as a wise mentor, or a hot-blooded hero. Unfortunately, none of these will be a Role in and of themselves, but you’ll still find yourself weakened when you act out-of-role anyway.,,
Rival,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Ah, a Rival! Truly a well worn path! So well worn, that someone seems to have been inserted into it for you! A random being in Creation will find themselves given the Role of Rival, and will do their absolute best to show you up. Fortunately, they’ll be on the same side as you, so don’t worry about them killing you or actively fucking you over in a permanent way, they’ll just... kinda be a dick as they try to be better than you.%%%%If you wish, you can choose to take them as a companion when this Jump ends.,,
Overdramatic,,4,,00,,False,,False,,You are extremely overdramatic. You just can’t help it! Whenever there’s an opportunity to chew the scenery, you’ll be biting at it like a starving man. If you’re a Hero, this will mostly be kind of annoying to your friends, but oddly, will tend to make you more effective during a fight. Therefor, to Heroes and Ambiguous, this is only worth 100. If you’re a villain, this is liable to get you stabbed in the middle of your monologue, or to preface you getting your ass kicked, and is thus worth 300.,,
‘Favored’ by Dwarves,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It seems you’re a favorite of the Dwarves. That’s a bad thing, by the way. You see, Dwarfish law holds that only Dwarves are capable of actually owning things. Everyone else just tends to have things in their vicinity. Which means that if a dwarf takes your stuff, legally speaking, he hasn’t actually done anything wrong. Add in that they can muster armies large enough to utterly annihilate any surface army, and well.%%%%Long story short, you’re going to get robbed a lot, and reporting things to the authorities won’t help.,,
Infiltrated,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Backstabbing. Always with the backstabbing. It’s like you can’t trust anyone these days! No matter what you do, you will inevitably find that someone is doing their level best to betray you. It won’t be immediately dangerous, but unless you simply don’t socialize at all, expect your enemies to know exactly what you’re up to, and for any weaknesses you have to be leaked. Even if you don’t talk to anyone, expect to deal with scrying spells, spies, and other such methods of information gathering.,,
The Girl Who Would Climb the Tower?,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It seems you’re an ambitious one. Your heart’s desire is to climb the Tower, to claim the title of Dread Emperor or Empress of Praes. There are hundreds of ways in which this is a bad idea, and most of them come down to “Because everyone else wants to as well.” The rest are, of course, “Because the Calamities will stab you in the face.”,,
Greenskin,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,It seems that you’re an Orc. Well. Just about everyone looks down on you, huh? The fact that your race tends to eat people’s eyes doesn’t really help. The fact that you’re the first Named to appear among them in centuries? And that their Names up until this point have been things like Warlord, whose whole shtick was burning down villages and kidnapping the citizens to take as slaves? Let’s just say that Evil is generally racist against you, and Good has good reasons to not be happy you’re here.,,
Jumper?,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Your Name is determined, you are the Jumper. Unfortunately, it appears this has brought... consequences. The Name only settles upon you the moment you enter the jump, and the vast majority of your power slumbers, locked away in your Aspects, as of yet unknown to you (As in, there’s a minor amnesia aspect so you’ll forget which Aspects you picked until you discover them during the jump). It will take immense amounts of time and effort to discover these Aspects and return access to the powers from beyond Creation, and even then, they will be limited in accessibility, each only coming forth when the Aspect they’re bound to activates.%%%%If one of your Aspects is STRUGGLE, for example, you will not be able to call upon a third of your powers unless you find yourself struggling.,,
Genre Blind,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,For some reason, no matter how many stories you hear, you simply cannot grok the patterns behind them. Every single time the villain loses, it will surprise you just as much as it did the first time.%%%%Normally, this would just make you kind of gullible, but in a world that literally runs on tropes, this can be lethal.,,
Nameless,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You have no Name, and thus, do not gain the benefits of the Named perk or supplement during this jump. Cannot take with Jumper.,,
Named,,1,,6000,,False,,True,,You, among the many mortals in Creation, have been granted a Role in the conflict that rules Creation.%%%%%%You are Named. Choose a side in the conflict that shatters the world.%%%%Hero?:%%The Hero, are you? Your Role may be that of the Underdog, but similarly, is that of the one destined to be the victor. Good always wins, after all. But do not rely on that too much. After all, every victory is only so great as the failures before it, and you may find that instead of the hero who freed the nation, you are simply the man who was killed to inspire him.%%%%Villain?:%%So the Gods Below have your allegiance? Know this. You are destined to lose. The world’s a stage, and you have been cast as the villain. Your fate is to fall, at best shouting a dramatic line as you do... but as I said, some have found ways to change the stories. Will you? It will be difficult, you know. Destiny detests being prevented from taking actions, and even if every potential hero is slain the moment he gains his power, you will only find them rising ever more frequently.%%%%Ambiguous?:%%Oh? Is this truly the path you wish to walk? Though neither the Gods Above nor those Below recognize shades of Black and White, some Names, simply by virtue of their Role, are grayer than others, pledging true allegiance to neither. Some transitional Names such as Squire, for example, can grow to become either the Black or White Knight, while others, such as Ranger, are simply... less than fully concerned with the wars of men.%%%%%%The Named are powerful, each masters of their field.%%%%Heroes find that Fate stands on their side. Despite often being teenagers shouting empty platitudes, their increased learning abilities will have them learning a month’s worth of skills in a single night, allowing them to force the world to kneel when it refuses to acknowledge the truth of their words. Although this only applies to skills that lie within the domain of their Role and Aspects, it’s amazing how well such a boost can be leveraged. %%%%Villains, on the other hand, will find themselves with greater abilities, both physical and mental, and will find their plans unfolding more easily, though they’ll find their momentum runs out quickly. At the start of any task, a villain will find his abilities heavily boosted, though they will quickly return to more normal levels over time.%%%%Finally, those with an Ambiguous name will find themselves drawing upon both sides, though not to nearly the same extent as one who has truly given their allegiance. Their learning speed is increased, allowing them two week’s worth of learning in a day, and their abilities near the start are increased by half the boost of a Villain’s.%%%%%%Of course, even beyond one’s alignment, each of the Named share certain traits. A Named is enhanced across the fields, increasing in their physical and magical abilities as is appropriate for that Name. Black Knight, for example, grants a greater physical increase than Warlock would, but both will find their physical stats increased.%%%%The more specialized the Name, the greater the increase in that particular area.%%%%Furthermore, a Name will often (though not always) grant its bearer access to at least some magic if they are not already capable of it. The Black Knight and his Squire must be capable of Necromancy, for example, and thus the Name will grant them that capability if it must, or enhance it if already there.%%%%%%Further, each of the Named have 3 powerful Aspects, representing a mixture of their Names and who they are underneath. Have 600 CP to distribute among 3 of the following.%%%%Finally, you may choose a free title to take as your Name. Titles include things like Page, Black Knight, Warlock, Ranger, etc. Basically, if it sounds like it could be a TTRPG class, it counts.%%%%%%A note: A Name will only grant the majority of it’s power when you’re acting according to either it’s theme or one of its Aspects. If your Name is Healer, it’s not exactly going to help you as you run around murdering things. This also applies to the increased learning aspect of a Hero’s name.%%%%%%And with that, one final warning: Heroes and Villains oppose one another. Such is the nature of their Names and Roles. A Hero who begins in territory ruled by Praes will find themselves almost immediately fighting for their lives; The Calamaties are well practiced at finding and slaying heroes before they can take advantage of their increased learning speeds and overthrow them, and are also quite used to simply punching through the defense that Destiny lays around the Named.,,
Name - TRIUMPH,,1,,00,,False,,True,,As a Jumper, it’s only appropriate that you TRIUMPH over your foes. Your Name will do it’s best to assure your victory. So long as you can edge out even the slightest advantage, your Name will take advantage of it, granting you more and more power until you stand, not simply the victor, but in absolute TRIUMPH.%%%%Of course, like with any other aspect, there is only so much power your Name can feed you.,,
Name - RAGE,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Your name is a furious one, it seems, unwilling to be bound. This Aspect will turn your fury into RAGE, allowing you to let your emotions spill forth and empower your blows.%%%%Be careful though; while a blade filled with rage will strike harder and it’s effects more difficult to heal, it will similarly be less accurate as your emotions eat away at your training and skill.,,
Name - QUICK,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You run fast, faster then most. In a dead sprint you could outrun a regular horse, and beasts you ride are also much faster.%%%%However, while it may make your feet light and your legs QUICK, it does nothing for your hands or your eyes and thoughts.,,
Name - SCHOLAR,,1,,00,,False,,True,,For most, it would take years to master a mundane field of study. A SCHOLAR such as yourself, however, can learn such minor skills at an unusual pace.. As a note, it greatly increases your reading speed.,,
Name - LUCK,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Some people are good. Others simply have the devil’s own LUCK. This aspect places you firmly in the second category. When casting a spell to hide you from a scrying spell, you might miserably miscast it to the point where it will only hide you from a great and powerful sorcerer’s personal scrying spell but not his minions more common ones... on the very day that he orders his minions to stop wasting their time scrying for you because he’s about to start doing so himself.%%%%Unfortunately, more than any other Aspect, this one is vulnerable to being brute-forced.,,
Name - SWING,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The skills of the Named are to be feared. So long as you fight with a blade in hand, you will find that every SWING cuts through steel like butter, and that your skills are unmatched among mortals.%%%%If you wish, you may replace this with STRIKE, PIERCE, SHOOT, or whatever is appropriate to a single weapon type of your choice.,,
Name - STRUGGLE,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Can this really be called appropriate for a Jumper? Well, so long as you find yourself in a STRUGGLE, your Name will grant you power to meet your task.%%%%Unfortunately, it won’t carry you all the way; a Name only has so much power to grant, after all.,,
Name - CAST,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Though all Named can call upon at least a degree of magic simply by throwing the power it grants them at Creation until something happens, your Name is particularly tuned for magic.%%%%Somehow, no matter how you fumble at it, any spell you try to CAST will go off as you intended. Oddly common among the Bumbling type. Or perhaps not so odd, considering that they’re still competent.,,
Name - TAME,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,For many Heroes, one of their greatest strengths is themselves. For you however, it is your ability to TAME animals. From small and humble mice, to mighty lions, animals listen to your command and follow your will.%%%%However, mythical beasts are beyond your control.,,
Name - RIDE,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Not all Heroes fight on foot. Many RIDE atop the backs of a horse or other beast, and now, so do you. Fighting atop a beast is natural to you, and your chosen mount is enhanced with you. Becoming more enduring, faster, and stronger than any mundane equivalent. Be careful however, for a horseman is measured by his horse, and without it he is devastated.,,
Name - LEARN,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,An Aspect often found in transitional type names, that is, names which eventually evolve into greater ones (Squire turning into Black Knight, for example). This aspect will increase your ability to LEARN by half again. Yes, this will stack with your other learning abilities.,,
Name - MENTOR,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,For each student, there is a master. While not all of your students may be named, you will have the ability to MENTOR others, greatly aiding them in developing skills similar to your own.,,
Name - RISE,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,An Aspect more common to heroes, so long as the Name holds out, the bearer will not fall. Your magical power can be spent to sustain your life.%%%%Unfortunately this only heals wounds that have yet to kill you; you won’t bleed out, but if someone bashes your brains out and you haven’t taken precautions, well, that’s that. Unless that happens though, you will RISE until you run out of magic.,,
Name - INVOKE,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Not simply casting a spell, but INVOKING it’s true nature, you’ll find that your reserves of magical energy are unnaturally high, letting you cast spells with little worry as to their cost.,,
Name - NOTICE,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your senses are beyond those of mere mortals, and no aspect of Creation is hidden from you. The corruption caused by demons, the displacement of the stars, the flutter of a butterfly’s wings a hundred yards away... all of it, you will NOTICE.,,
Name - BLESS,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Almost exclusive to Heroes, as the Gods Below hold little truck with any sort of organized religions, you have been granted a small aspect of the Holy power of the Gods Above.%%%%You may BLESS those who stand before you, healing them of their ills, and washing away near any wound, as well as making them stronger, faster, luckier, and more durable for the week to come.%%%%Further, you are one of the few beings in Creation capable of truly slaying a Demon, not simply sealing it as others must.,,
Name - CORRUPT,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It seems your nature as a being born from beyond Creation has affected your Name.%%%%Your touch is anathema, warping the flesh and minds of those you touch, until all that’s left is madness and horror.%%%%Your presence will be enough to slowly CORRUPT those before you, and your touch both accelerates and nearly guarantees it.%%%%And not just men, but the very Laws of creation itself will slowly twist, weakening the borders between the realm that the Gods created and the endless and primordial void beyond.,,
Name - VOID,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The endless infinities, born from your nature... are you, perhaps, a demon? This Aspect is one of those who are lost, their very existence VOID.%%%%No power will detect your coming; neither mortal senses nor magical scryings and wards, nor even the Names of those who sense the world around them.%%%%If one wishes to find you, they must seek you out by the clues you leave of your existence.,,
Name - SPEAK,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Far more common among those Names inclined toward rulership, this Aspect is one of leaders and liars. Of politicians, one might say. When you SPEAK, you do so with the authority of creation behind you. Those standing in your presence find themselves hardpressed to deny your authority, with only the most stubborn being able to avoid almost instinctively acting in accordance with your will.%%%%While many Named receive a lesser version of this ability simply by virtue of their Role, yours is vastly superior, even affecting beings that other Named would not be able to, and far more subtle as well, going unnoticed except by the extremely observant or self-aware.,,
Name - STEAL,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Unfortunately common among Rogues, Thieves, and Rakes, this is an aspect that one would think more tilted toward Evil than it is.%%%%You can not only reach past magical wards and pick locks with the best of them, but also STEAL things that, by all rights, you should not be able to. Making off with an entire fleet of warships during a single night level off theft.,,
Name - SUMMON,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Sometimes a magician finds that his own power is not enough. Sometimes he finds himself making contracts. Fortunately, your Name is well suited to such things. When you SUMMON a being and bind it to yourself, you will find it’s price goes unpaid.,,
Name - SWIFT,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are the closest thing to a tornado of blades there ever was. You swing fast and hard, both hands with separate blades. You truly are as SWIFT and as dexterous as the wind, in both action and reaction. At least in close quarters.,,
Name - RULE,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Being a leader is difficult, however for you, it is not so. Those underneath you are better at their jobs, the commoners beneath them are hard working and peaceful. The right to RULE is a great responsibility, with immense power, although the full power of your Name is invested in others, rather than yourself.,,
Name - CONQUER,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Often found in Villains, this Aspect is a powerful one. Though it possesses little uniqueness, that is, perhaps, a boon, as all the power of the Name is steered toward simply enhancing you in every way it can.%%%%So long as you are on the offense, so long as you are the one who wishes to CONQUER, your Name shall grant you it’s strength.,,
Name - PROTECT,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Heroic counterpart to CONQUER, it is only natural that for every attacker, there be a defender. So long as you act in defense of others, your Name will grant you it’s strength, letting you stand tall and proud in order to PROTECT them.,,
Name - TAKE,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The dominion of Villains, this is truly a Villainous Aspect. By slaying a foe, you may call upon one aspect of their being and TAKE it for your own.%%%%It will last for no more than ten uses... but surely that will be enough?%%%%Of course, any power stronger than the amount granted by a Name will burn away more quickly, and the strongest will simply exceed your grasp.,,
Name - SORCERY,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Common to Names such as Warlock or White Wizard, this Aspect is truly potent. Beyond placing near every magic within your reach, it will empower your magic to a staggering degree.%%%%You will be able to reroute the fate of armies, to single-handedly determine entire battles.,,
Name - SLAY,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You, are really, really good at the act of killing. Your weapons care little for whether someone is immortal, or mandated to live.%%%%When you SLAY something, it stays dead. Your weapon finds weak points in enemy armor, your spells ignore resistances and immunities enough to potentially kill your foes.,,
