Universal Drawbacks,,6,,105000,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Origin,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Due to the time since the conflict, there’s no real difference between a drop-in (someone with no history in the world and no memories) and a non-drop-in, as any core will have already lost all memories.%%%%There are six origins, based upon the six lines of combat units in common service here.%%%%Pick two.,,
Dagger,,0,,00,,True,,False,,The Dagger line is the ground workhorse, consisting of armed bipedal robots.,,
Nova,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Nova line is the ground commander line, possessing useful support abilities, including construction capabilities.,,
Crawler,,0,,00,,False,,False,,With the exception of the titular T1 unit, the Crawler line are all capable of crawling up and down walls, and over buildings. This makes them the specialists on the ground.,,
Flare,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Flare line are the “standard” air units, giving fighters, bombers,and some powerful airships.,,
Mono,,0,,00,,True,,False,,The Mono line is the air command line, consisting of flying support units. While some do have offensive capabilities, their main benefit doesn’t come from shooting the enemy.,,
Risso,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The only naval line, the Risso line does have some serious combat capabilities.,,
The Core Experience,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mandatory%%%%You gain an altform, that of the Core.%%%%Cores are robotic buildings designed to support military infrastructure. Cores store bulk resources, act as a commander for an army or defensive outpost, have powerful sensors that can reveal an entire battlefield, and are generally the most durable building on the battlefield.%%%%They are also practically immune to g-forces, as the faster forms of intraplanetary transport is with ballistic trajectories, and their form of interplanetary transport is shooting them out of a giant electromagnetic gun.%%%%Cores also protect the infrastructure and defenses around them. An active core will protect their entire base, regardless of distance, physical connection, or power, with a field that protects against deconstruction and other such types of attacks - if your enemy wants your stuff gone, they’ll have to actually attack it.%%%%They can also block teleport attempts nearby.%%%%This field is strongest closest to the core and is strong enough to stop enemies from building there, or any other sorts of similar tricks. The range of that inner field is longer than any artillery piece, forcing an actual assault.%%%%You may upgrade your core form with the use of a massive amount of resources, though there are only two levels above Shard (Foundation and Nucleus) that have been engineered. These benefits only apply while you are in this altform, though, and don’t carry over into possession.,,
Universal Driver Installation,,1,,00,,True,,True,,As a core, your experience involves a lot more switching bodies than it might sound like.%%%%You are comfortable being in any body, regardless of composition, shape, or even degrees of freedom. In addition, fluency translates easily between bodies - your skill at using one body is the same as any other. You are also aware of all the capabilities of a body you are using.,,
Core Guardian Avatar,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Guardian Avatar is generated by the core. It’s a hover-capable aircraft armed with basic weapons, but its main purpose is to build the infrastructure and defenses of the base. It can also mine some materials and haul bulk resources around.%%%%You control the Avatar by possessing it, so it gains your powers while you are operating it.%%%%Your Guardian Avatar scales with you, gaining more powerful weapons, more durability, more speed, and better support capabilities as you grow stronger.%%%%It takes no resources to spawn the Guardian Avatar, and it leaves no wreckage. All it takes is a moment of concentration, and it will appear right over you.%%%%You can’t be killed through the Guardian Avatar, either.%%%%Normally you would only be able to spawn a Guardian Avatar in your core altform, but for 200 CP you may also generate it while in any form. Operating the Guardian Avatar requires a full human brain’s worth of thought, so you might want to sit down while in human form while doing so.,,Purchased at second tier
Assuming Direct Control,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Another ability of the Core is to possess units and remotely control them. It doesn’t matter if it would normally support that or not, a core can possess their infrastructure, defenses, and units and control them.%%%%You too can possess anything automated and not protected (by say, another core). You  possess this form of possession, but normally only while in your Guardian Avatar or while already possessing something. This results in the destruction of the Guardian Avatar if in that, or the target returning to normal behavior otherwise.%%%%For 300 CP, you may possess something directly from your body, and may, with the consent of your target, possess a person. When possessing something directly from your actual body, your body will vanish until you stop possessing or the possessing object is destroyed. If what you are possessing is destroyed, it does not count as a death. You will merely be shunted to a nearby identical unit or structure, be forced back to your body, or have your body manifest right next to where the object was.,,Purchased at second tier
Core Network,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Cores can self-replicate.%%%%The default method of doing so causes the new core to be flung on a ballistic trajectory, to potentially anywhere on a planet. Operational history suggests a a limit of 500 km for normal operations. Once landed a core is rather hard to move, though. In addition, you can transfer between these cores at will, and will do so automatically in case your current body is killed.%%%%Your other cores have a default monitoring program that will alert you in the case of any problems, and can make some attempt to correct them.%%%%While you may maintain these abilities for free for the next ten years, it costs 400 CP to take all of these capabilities with you.,,
Pentative Reconstructor,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Reconstructors take units and make them bigger, badder, and beefier. You possess a similar capability, being able to upgrade any physical object, including people. This might not make the target bigger, but it will improve durability, firepower, and any support capabilities the target has.%%%%With practice you’ll be able to tune what improvements you provide, but they will still be improvements.%%%%Doing this takes a small amount of time, a large amount of resources (dependent on the power of whatever is being upgraded) and access to some sort of power source.%%%%It also requires the target sit still for the period of time.,,
Dagger - Bullet goes in Enemy,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You know how to fight. Not only which end of the gun goes towards the enemy, but how to lead a target, how to move while fighting, and all the thousands of bits of advice that veterans know and recruits don’t.,,
Dagger - Bullet Works up Close,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Some people say you shouldn’t bring big grenades into small rooms. You can. You’re immune to friendly fire and fragging yourself, so you can drop a live grenade at zero range and walk away unscathed. Or at least not care about having to hit yourself with artillery fire to deal with pests.,,
Dagger - Bullet does not go Next to Enemy,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The difference between theoretical maximum range and effective maximum range is that the former just wastes ammo while the latter is often too close for comfort. Not for you.%%%%Not only are you a crack shot at all ranges, your attacks actually can exceed the theoretical maximum range assumed of them by a bit.,,
Dagger - Bullet does not go in You,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are beefy.%%%%Not only can you take about three or four times as many hits before going down, those hits have to be harder because you are now tougher.%%%%In fact, anything that makes attacks have to do more work applies all the way down. Your armor makes your body tougher, and a blast inside the armor of your core form would do just as much damage as on your armored hull.,,
Dagger - Bullet goes in Every Enemy,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,When in doubt, shooting more will often solve problems. And now you demonstrate that.%%%%The faster you hit and the more enemies you hit, the more effective each hit will be, and the faster you can attack. Spewing bullets vaguely in the direction of a mob of enemies was never so satisfying.%%%%The boost has no upper limit, and only starts to fade after about half an hour of not attacking anyone.%%%%This also means you never have to worry about consuming ammo, coolant, or energy, reloading, or any other limitation to the quantity of your attacks.%%%%Even attack spells no longer have any cost because of this.,,
Nova - Spine for Trouble,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Being in charge of commanding forces, it pays to keep a cool head. Thus, you can do that, and are completely immune to panic. Besides that, you are also immune to tunnel vision, always being able to immediately step back and take a look at the bigger picture.,,
Nova - Legs for Jumping,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Nova line, with the exception of the Corvus, can all jump over walls and buildings. This is despite the fact that the Vela could probably crush modern-day tanks under its feet.%%%%You too possess an improbable jumping ability, letting you effectively control how gravity works for you, adjusting it from only having the barest fraction of its strength to letting you land right now.%%%%It’ll let you turn off the boost thruster on a Nova-line unit and let you use the weapon again, or jump with a Dagger-line or Craweler-line unit.,,
Nova - Hands for Building,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Things that you build take a quarter of the time to complete. Whether that’s using a Guardian Avatar’s constructor beam or you’re just putting together some flat-packed furniture, you’ll be done sooner.,,
Nova - Heart for Healing,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Your attacks now heal your allies while still hurting your enemies. You can’t heal the dead, but you can shoot a dying man to perfect health.%%%%Not only that, but attacks that apply an effect to an enemy will reverse that effect if it hits a friendly. Put out people on fire by using a flamethrower.%%%%And yes, this does work against disguised enemies and for hidden allies.,,
Nova - Brain for Commanding,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You can multitask like a champ. You can control your Guardian Avatar, dozens of turrets, a human body, and hundreds of units all at once with perfect synchronization.%%%%It even works through interfaces, letting you use a single computer to control hundreds of units, if you wanted to.%%%%While it is unlimited in quantity, it is limited in quality. The mental threads created by this are specialized for whatever hardware you have them operating.%%%%While they can still plan and think ahead, thoughts not related to their hardware slip away easily,,
Crawler - Coal Heart,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Crawler is brave, rushing headlong at defenses with no regard for its life.%%%%While you can act without regard to your own life, it’s probably not a good idea and your survival instincts still work when you are in your actual body.%%%%Still, you are immune to minor things like fear, stress, trauma, and despair.,,
Crawler - Sticky Fingers,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Let’s face it, walls are annoying, especially when you need to get past them.%%%%Fortunately, you can climb anything. A wall? Sure. A waterfall? Not a problem.%%%%That doesn’t always mean that it’s a good idea to climb that particular thing. Consider, for instance, that walls made of surge alloy can electrocute unwanted climbers.,,
Crawler - Impenetrable Skin,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are immune to environmental conditions. Not individual lightning strikes, but hail, rain, extreme pressures, corrosive gases, all of those you are immune to. In addition, the protective field of your core form shares this effect with any allied structures or units within it.,,
Crawler - Vampire Fangs,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You can heal by damaging things, healing yourself equivalent to any damage dealt.%%%%This not only applies to your own weapons, but also deployed weapons like mines and the continuous effects of damage. Set something on fire to gain regeneration.%%%%If you are riding in a vehicle, you can channel this into the vehicle and let its damage output repair it.,,
Crawler - Weaving Hands,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,There are so many fun and exciting ways to modify your attacks. Why not use all of them?%%%%With this, you can learn different effects by being shot with them or using a weapon that inflicts them, that you can then apply to your own attacks later. And you can stack them. Want to make bullets that shock their target, set them on fire, and slow them down, as well as split on impact to keep doing that? Sure.%%%%The stronger you are, the more powerful or longer-lasting these effects are.%%%%Just note that you can’t stack mutually exclusive effects (setting things on fire and freezing them) and the more effects you use, the less powerful each of them will be.,,
Flare - Tornado Hunter,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Flying can be difficult, especially if you’re on a planet with horrid weather like Serpulo. What, did you think the mass desertification caused by a hypercompetitive bioengineered organism and the smoke from fires caused by a war did any favors for the climate?%%%%Fortunately, you know how to fly, and you know how to fly in bad weather. Rain? Dust storm? Hail? Not a problem for you.%%%%Just as long as the airframe holds up, you can get it where it needs to go.,,
Flare - Frequent Bomber,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Horizons rely on lots of hits to destroy a target.%%%%Fortunately for you, whenever you strike a target, any further strikes against it are a tiny bit more effective.%%%%You’ll need to hit a target a lot, but this won’t reset with time, distance, or peace.,,
Flare - Marathon Runner,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Battles can take a while.%%%%Fortunately you have unlimited endurance, being able to maintain strenuous mental or physical activity indefinitely. You still need to recover from them once they’re done, but no more than if you had been doing those activities for an amount of time doable for someone with a normal amount of endurance.%%%%This also eliminates your need to sleep in organic forms.,,
Flare - Ace Fighter,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,No matter how bulky the body you’re using or the vehicle you’re operating, you remain as agile as your most nimble forms.%%%%This doesn’t affect speed, but you can stop on a dime or do pirouettes just as well as you could in human form. This includes turrets, making them able to aim as fast as you could point.%%%%In addition, you can share your agility with nearby allies, bring them up to your level.,,
Flare - Blockade Runner,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Sometimes you want to rush past a defensive line in order to attack a nice vulnerable target.%%%%With this, the more you are attacked - even if those attacks don’t hit - the more mobility you have. More powerful attacks charge this faster. Not only speed, but also maneuverability and reflexes are improved. Even things like teleportation benefit from this.%%%%In addition, the more maneuverability you have, the more effective your personal defenses are. Your armor gets tougher, your shields recharge faster, and everything gets more durable.%%%%While these boosts do fade, it’s over the course of five or so minutes without getting attacked. Plenty of time to duck back and get fixed up by a nest of repair points.,,
Mono - Logistics is done by some kind of Spreadsheet Wizard,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The humble Mono supports the war effort through automatic mining. Like the Mono, you understand that proper allocation of resources is key to a successful battle.%%%%To that end, you pretty much have a spreadsheet program in your head, and you know how to use it. Calculating the cost of construction, comparing it to projected mining, all that’s a snap.%%%%Expect to be able to optimize your post-landing buildup with very little experience.,,
Mono - Teamwork is some kind of Magic,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,A single Poly isn’t that fast of a builder, but a team of two dozen of them can pop down a defensive wall in moments.%%%%You also have excellent teamwork, being continuously aware of what your teammates and allies are planning to do and what resources they need.%%%%You can also share this with your allies.,,
Mono - Designed by some kind of Geometry Nerd,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Let’s face it, fitting buildings and belts in order to construct a functioning economy is kind of hard.%%%%You, on the other hand, can very easily understand the ways components in a system interact with each other, letting you design a system without adverse interactions, in a way that would be bewildering to many.%%%%In addition, you understand how to make things modular, so you understand how to design a production module so it can be copied for increased production, or intermediates can be easily extracted, or any other tricks of design wizardry.,,
Mono - The Blessing of some kind of Angel,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Quad’s massive bomb can serve as a healing field, repairing everything in a massive area.%%%%Whenever your actions heal or boost an ally, you can choose to allow the effect to echo, hitting allies nearby with a reduced version of the same effect.%%%%The echoes can’t create echoes of their own, though. No creating an infinite loop.,,
Mono - You'd have to be some kind of Tactical Genius,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,How the heck do five toxopids fit into the hold of an oct? Seriously, they each have more leg than the oct has airframe. Apparently the answer is “fuck you and the base I just dropped them in.” Which is your answer for how you pull off the space-warping, defense-breaking, salt-inducing nonsense that you do.%%%%You can fit units and structures in spaces that they should not be able to fit, and you can fit more of them than can be considered reasonable.%%%%Shove a row of six meltdowns in a narrow canyon where daggers are scraping the walls. Airdrop a dozen toxopids and their escorts per oct in a raid. Weave dozens of belts through a single gap.%%%%This also improves any storages that you use - even a storage as small as a pocket benefits from a few times the space.,,
Risso - Threat Weighting Oracle Protocol,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The Risso is the most powerful and most durable of the T1 units, putting it in the weight class of of T2 units. Fortunately, you’ll never make the mistake of underestimating your opponents.%%%%You have the instinctive ability to evaluate your opponents, identifying how difficult of a fight it would be for you and your allies to defeat someone.%%%%This does not provide comprehensive information on your opponents, just tells you the actual difficulty level, ignoring any attempt at enemy deception.,,
Risso - Haste Status Firepower Field,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You overdrive the weapons of your nearby allies, letting them attack slightly faster. And yes, you are your own ally.,,
Risso - Armour Regen Shield Field,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Any nearby allies to you gets a slight buff to their defenses.%%%%In addition, these defenses get a minor bonus regeneration, even if those defenses would normally require some sort of external repair.,,
Risso - Scatter Homing Bullet Hell,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Let’s face it, some enemies are dodgy sorts and you don’t always have time to line up a proper shot to nail them.%%%%You can quadruple any projectile attack you make.%%%%But more than that, you can make those projectiles homing, not just straight at the target but in elaborate patterns to box it in or saturate an area around it.,,
Risso - Flare Bodyguard Factory Mothership,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Dealing with enemies is a pain. Fortunately, you don't have to worry about being separated from help.%%%%You can spawn in allies to protect you. With the strength and abilities of a Shard core, you can either summon in up to eight Flares or eight generic “bodyguards.”%%%%The bodyguards match your species and will be dressed appropriately for the situation.%%%%Your summons gain strength and abilities based on your own, roughly proportional to your own gains.%%%%It doesn’t cost anything to summon in your summons.%%%%They spawn in two at a time and immediately begin resummoning if any of them are killed.,,
Basic Blueprints,,2,,00,,True,,True,,Standard military construction patterns, with no design notes, from the time when the Shard-class cores were the only type. This means anything that requires thorium, surge alloy, or phase fabric isn’t included here,  such as the units of T3 and higher.%%%%Those blueprints can be found if you want to bother sorting through the wreckage of various bases across Serpulo, and those will stick with you if you find them.,,
Launch Pads,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Lets you add launch pads to any properties you have (including the warehouse).%%%%In addition to being able to automatically move items from storage in one property to another, you can also use them to retrieve your items from any of your properties, regardless of where you are.,,
Cultivator Project Notes,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,These provide documentation on cultivating and processing the hyper-efficient biomass generators called “spores.” While spores do have many uses, being careless with them will lead to total ecological collapse of a planet’s environment. Not only are the spores able to outcompete plants on just energy and nutrient requirements, they also have some very toxic metabolic products that made the destruction of Serpulo’s ecosystem assured when the biomass synthesis facility developing them was attacked and they were released.%%%%The notes also include some work on biological control methods for the spores, but the research is incomplete. For now, just make sure your spore facilities aren’t blown up.%%%%The notes on modifying spores for different usages are more complete, but research and testing will be required for any modifications attempted.,,
Medical Projectors,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,While the core technology might share some characteristics with biology, especially the vehicles, they aren’t biological in any real sense. This means the repair equipment isn’t medical equipment.%%%%These are modifications to that technology, allowing for healing beams and fields of various sizes and power.,,
Teleport Equipment,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This equipment consists of two parts: a beacon for the receiving end, and a transmitter. The beacon is rated for being launched by artillery at distances of 500-700 km. The transmitter requires a massive amount of energy, and when activated teleports specified units nearby it to corresponding locations next to the beacon.%%%%Part of the reason for the energy cost is that the process also vaporizes anything nearby. However, cores can jam the process, so a landing site must be sufficiently far from the core.,,
Extraction Outpost,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,An extrauniversal mining site that has unlimited deposits of any raw material you have used so far, or that is used in any material you have crafted with in the past.%%%%While it can provide any of these materials to your location, into your core storage, or to any of your properties, it is limited by the number of launch pads to deliver the bulk materials.%%%%It starts with five launch pads and gains five more at the end of Jumps. (Or every ten years post-chain.) Each launch pad can deliver enough material for most mid-sized turrets per rocket, which can launch as fast as every 30 seconds.%%%%While the mining site can be entered like the warehouse, you can’t remove anything you didn’t enter with, nor can you add additional launch pads, which are the only way to remove things you didn’t bring into the mining site.%%%%Feel free to add production buildings to the site, as that way you can get refined materials delivered.%%%%The site provides all the power it needs.,,
Anuke Arsenal Solutions, Inc. Proprietary Documents,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A complete set of data for the turrets used during the war on Serpulo.%%%%Not only does this contain the more modern turret blueprints like the fuse, segment, and meltdown, it includes complete design documentation for all the turrets as well.%%%%That should allow someone with enough engineering skill to design new turrets for new situations, or modify the existing turrets to fit current needs.%%%%This also includes the wall blocks, mender and mend projector, and force projector.,,
Anuken Dynamics Proprietary Documents,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Similar to the Anuke Arsenal Solutions documents, this contains not only the more modern vehicle designs (T3 and up) but also the design documentation.%%%%Again, this would allow someone with enough engineering skill to create new vehicles or modify existing ones.%%%%This also includes the command center, factories, repair point, resupply point, and reconstructors.,,
BeltCo. Proprietary Documents,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,Similar to the Anuke and Anukun options, this grants the modern infrastructure blueprints and all infrastructure-related design notes.%%%%This includes the core designs, as well as all factories and power systems.,,
Multi-Drop,,3,,00,,False,,False,,Max of eight, 50 CP for 1 - 4, 200 CP for 5 - 8.%%%%Import an existing Companion as another Shard-class core. They get one Origin, 700 CP to spend as they please, and a +100 CP Item stipend.,,
Multi-Drop - Multiplayer Madness,,3,,00,,False,,False,,Import an existing Companion as another Shard-class core.%%%%They get a copy of a Multi-drop’s build (their choice), but do not get any CP.,,
Just a Shard,,4,,5000,,False,,False,,Your powers and perks from before you got to this world are suppressed, like you don’t have them.%%%%Likewise, all your items in your warehouse are locked down so you can’t interact with them, even if you can still put things in the warehouse.,,
Stick to the Core Experience,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You lose access to all altforms except the core form. Good luck using your kung fu when you’re a building. If you have shapeshifting, that doesn’t work either.%%%%You are going to be a building for this entire Jump. Though on the other hand, at least you won’t turn into a form that needs to breathe, given the atmosphere.,,
Team: Yellow,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,Your color is yellow. It appears on all your turrets, all your buildings, everything you build. In fact, yellow is your color this jump.%%%%And it’s also indistinguishable from the same yellow as everyone else in the party. Have fun with that issue.,,Retail Rocker
Starter Pack,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It seems you’ve gotten only a very limited subset of your basic blueprints. You only have access to mechanical drills, copper conveyors, junctions, duos, and small copper walls.%%%%You’ll need to find the other blueprints on your own if you want to take them with you.%%%%Then you need to unlock those blueprints by destroying large amounts of the materials needed to construct the buildings. Enough to make, say, a thousand of them? That seems fine. I won’t make you do it all at once, though.%%%%If you purchased any Proprietary Documents, you do not get the notes for a building or structure until you get the blueprint.,,
Starter Pack - Map Lock,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Not only do you have to deal with finding all the blueprints for all the stuff, certain blueprints are locked behind defeating specific enemy bases.%%%%So, for example, in order to get 14 the launch pad blueprints you have to attack a specific resource stockpile used during the civil war.%%%%At least you become aware of where these sites are once you encounter one of these locked blueprints.,,
Synthetic Intelligence means "Kinda Stupid",,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It seems your units are running on the most basic code ever. They’re a pain to deal with, flying directly through enemy AA to get to their destinations, getting stuck on power nodes and random rocks, and generally displaying the same kind of decision-making as would come from 100 lines of code tops.%%%%This not only applies to Mindustry units, but any other automated units you use.,,
Avatar Costs a lot,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You may only spawn your Guardian Avatar for free once. After that, spawning it will consume resources, in accordance with the power of the Avatar.%%%%A Shard with no powers before this would require enough resources to make a Poly, while more powerful people would require significantly more to make their Avatars.,,
Intruder at the Gates,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Normally the damaged enemy systems give up trying to force you from a sector after a few dozen attempts. Now, any base of yours that isn’t surrounded by your other bases will be under near-constant attacks from enemy forces teleporting in. At least they keep teleporting in at the same location. And the waves do get bigger and badder as time goes on.%%%%If you leave your borders stationary for too long, you’ll be seeing insane attacks.,,
Intruder at the Gates - Blitz,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Oh, I’m sorry, I was mistaken - all of your bases will be under near-constant siege, not just your border bases.,,
Hot Drop,,4,,6000,,True,,False,,Oh, did I say Ground Zero was lightly defended?%%%%Sorry, my bad, it’s actually a massive, heavily fortified base with a dozen cores that you’ll have to destroy before you can leave the area.,,Retail rocker
Wave Shields,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Every instance of every unit you kill will be a bit tougher than the last. Not by a huge amount - a shot from a duo would probably make up the difference - but it doesn’t reset until you end the Jump.%%%%Have fun dealing with Crawlers capable of tanking Meltdown beams.,,
Rival Reclaimer,,4,,5000,,False,,True,,Must take with 500 CP of drawbacks%%%%When taking this Drawback, you do not get the +500 CP from this drawback at the start of the Jump. Instead, you get it at the end, and may open up this sheet and make additional purchases with your CP. Another Shard has fallen to Serpulo at the same time as you, but somewhere else.%%%%The intelligence controlling it is brutal and cunning. It will learn your tactics and adapt to them. The weaknesses in your tactics will be pressed hard. Any technology it recovers, it can reverse-engineer and mass-produce.%%%%This Shard has fought for the length of the entire war and not only has every single blueprint in its core database, but also all the design notes and the engineering skill to adapt its tools towards countering you. %%%%It is bloodthirsty and grows stronger. It will not stop until it is killed, and every single core that it created is turned to scrap.%%%%The Jump will not end until you defeat it completely. In return for going to this timeline, you get to keep Serpulo. In future Jumps, it can be imported into the setting somewhere out of the way, or just remain in a pocket dimension.,,
