Rolling Meter,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Instead of a health bar instantly falling upon injury, yours is more like an odometer, with numbers ticking down after you’re hit. You don’t actually have a numerical measure of wellness, but whenever you’re injured, you always get several seconds until it takes effect.%%%%When combined with a potent healing power and strategic use, you’ll become incredibly hard to kill, and can take on enemies that hit many times stronger than you. Though, do be aware that some powers in this world can completely bypass the Meter.%%%%It’s free while you’re here, but keeping it will cost 300CP.,,
Traveller - Martial Arts,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Using yo-yos and slingshots to fight is a little undignified, don’t you think?

Traveller - Ascetic,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,For much of your life, you’ve been forced to abide by a special restricted diet. Well, it isn’t a completely bad thing. You can survive far longer with little to no food than any ordinary person. Just water and rice gruel will be enough to get by for months at a time. As a bonus, you can actually recover large amounts of your psychic (or other) energies just by drinking water.,,
Traveller - Mirror,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,When facing an enemy, you can transform into a copy of them so precise that you’re able to use some of their special abilities! Mirroring robotic or ghostly creatures is possible, too. It doesn’t last for a very long time, but is sure to help in a fight, especially since opponents will be less inclined to attack you after transforming.%%%%However, it’s rather difficult to use this ability on allies, or other humans... but I’m sure you can figure it out eventually.%%%%%%This ability won’t allow you to copy the powers of anyone stronger than you.,,
Traveller - Mu Training,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,A form of meditative martial arts that involves the incredible ability to ignore everything around you. If you focus and remain still, you’ll enter an illusionary world filled with darkness. Here, you’ll be able to talk to the spirits of your ancestors. If you prove yourself to them, they’ll whisper secrets to you and help unlock powerful abilities. Succeeding will likely be a painful task... though well worth it.,,
Nerd - Explosives Expert,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,From bombs to bottle rockets, you can do it all.

Plus, any shady guys you encounter are unusually willing to sell you them, or other questionably legal weapons.,,
Nerd - Spy,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,By peering intently at any enemy you face, you’ll instantly discover which of your attacks they’re the weakest to.

Just be sure not to wake anyone up.,,
Nerd - Chimeric Engineering,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Like Dr. Andonuts, you’ve discovered how to make unholy abominations, er, wonders of modern science, called Chimeras. They can be made from fusions of animals, cybernetics, or perhaps even inorganic objects. Modifications to preexisting animals or people are possible, too. Simple combinations like mice and flies are trivial - maybe, you could make a hybrid of a man and a dungeon? Though, do be careful... wouldn’t want your creations to go rogue, would you?%%%%Note that this also enables you to easily combine any previously incompatible biologies or technologies, and make a finished result that incorporates the best qualities of both.,,
Village Kid - Backyard Weaponary,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Baseball bats, yo-yos, slingshots and the like are your tools of choice, and you’re damn effective with them. In your hands, they perform significantly better than any conventional weapons of similar quality. From these skills, you’ve also developed a talent for utilizing other common items as deadly weapons. Want to bash in alien heads with a frying pan? Go for it.,,
Village Kid - SMAAAASH!!,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Every so often, you’ll land a beautiful, clean hit that does a massively higher amount of damage to your opponent. You’ve become quite Gutsy, too, allowing you to hold on to life for that last critical moment to land the final blow.%%%%Even better, a SMAAAASH!! won’t happen when it would be inconvenient for you.,,
Village Kid - Presents,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Is that... a gift box? In a forest, of all places? It’s white, with a nice red bow.

Village Kid - Your World,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Sometime during your journey, you’ll enter Magicant, the realm of your mind. There, all memories breathe life, and you can encounter past lives or versions of your younger self, along with family members, friends, and enemies you’ve defeated. You may come and go, with a brief period of meditation. Occasionally, you’ll discover healing items that can be taken outside.%%%%Though, somewhere in its depths lurks your Nightmare. It’s a reflection of yourself and your subconscious, with access to all powers and abilities you possess. If you manage to defeat it, you’ll absorb Magicant, triggering a massive power boost... though, there won’t be any second chances to succeed.,,
Alien - Death Action,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You may not be a tree, but you’ve definitely got one thing in common with those annoying plants. Upon receiving a deadly blow, you can instantly burst into flame. It’ll do massive damage to anyone in the immediate area, making sure they they’ll go out with you. Unless you’re somehow able to survive a fatal injury, that is.%%%%This ability mildly scales to the enemy you’re facing.

Alien - Teleport Gamma,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,It’s technically a PSI power, but one that humans (perhaps) can’t learn on their own. Unlike the lengthy startup of the Alpha or Beta versions of Teleport, you can move short or long distances in the blink of an eye. If you’re skilled or lucky enough to reappear right behind someone, you’ll always have a quick split-second window to attack before they notice you.,,
Alien - Evil Eye,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Turning opponents into stone? No, with just a glance, you can transform them into statues of solid diamond.%%%%Unlike other status effects, like burns or poison, this one’s particularly nasty and difficult to get rid of. It’ll take the most potent healing PSI or items to do the job. %%%%Until then, they’ll be stuck as an inanimate hunk of diamond... though, you won’t be able to hurt them while they’re like that.,,
Alien - George's Legacy,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Whether you discovered a certain journal, or are simply an incredible scientist, you’ve delved far deeper into the secrets of PSI powers than (nearly) anyone else. Building machines of war that utilize it is child’s play, and you can pass it on to others, too... whether alien or human. Inanimate objects aren’t out of the question, either.%%%%Though, do be sure to keep that last bit a secret. After humans found out about PSI, Giygas and the others have been trying quite hard to reclaim that knowledge. If your intent is to spread it to this world or others, they’ll be none too happy with you if you’re found out.,,

Welcome to Moonside,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Fourside? Are you still sleeping? This is backwards city Moonside, where no means yes and yes means no. The world doesn’t look strange at all, and its cities and people are in perfect order. Nothing’s out to get you, I promise.,,

They can be made from fusions of animals, cybernetics, or perhaps even inorganic objects. Modifications to preexisting animals or people are possible, too. Simple combinations like mice and flies are trivial - maybe, you could make a hybrid of a man and a dungeon? Though, do be careful... wouldn’t want your creations to go rogue, would you?%%%%Note that this also enables you to easily combine any previously incompatible biologies or technologies, and make a finished result that incorporates the best qualities of both.,,
Village Kid - Backyard Weaponary,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Baseball bats, yo-yos, slingshots and the like are your tools of choice, and you’re damn effective with them.

Village Kid - Presents,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Is that... a gift box? In a forest, of all places? It’s white, with a nice red bow. Huh, you seem to stumble upon these rather frequently.%%%%They’ll always contain useful items, such as healing food, weapons, or stat-boosting items.%%%%They’re appropriate to the danger level of the world and specific location, so don’t expect to find some legendary item in a trash bin.,,
Village Kid - Your World,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Sometime during your journey, you’ll enter Magicant, the realm of your mind.

Alien - Evil Eye,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Turning opponents into stone? No, with just a glance, you can transform them into statues of solid diamond.%%%%Unlike other status effects, like burns or poison, this one’s particularly nasty and difficult to get rid of.

Alien - George's Legacy,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Whether you discovered a certain journal, or are simply an incredible scientist, you’ve delved far deeper into the secrets of PSI powers than (nearly) anyone else. Building machines of war that utilize it is child’s play, and you can pass it on to others, too... whether alien or human. Inanimate objects aren’t out of the question, either.%%%%Though, do be sure to keep that last bit a secret. After humans found out about PSI, Giygas and the others have been trying quite hard to reclaim that knowledge.

Trashburger,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,To put it bluntly, you’re disgusting, lazy, and gross.

Welcome to Moonside,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Fourside? Are you still sleeping? This is backwards city Moonside, where no means yes and yes means no. The world doesn’t look strange at all, and its cities and people are in perfect order. Nothing’s out to get you, I promise.,,
