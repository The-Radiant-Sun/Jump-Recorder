While only .5% of the 20,000 currently active Valkyrie pilots are male your gender really doesn’t matter. Pick either one for free though as one of the rare males you will get some attention.%%%%All origins are either enrolled at or teach at one of the three UN Valkyrie training academies. Roll 1d3 for which Academy you will be attending or pay 50CP to choose.%%1- Perth – Where the story takes place. Easier access to Anna.%%2- Beijing%%3- Santiago - Where an inter-academy tournament will be held this year.%%%%%%You and your companions are immune to developing Valkyrie Detachment Syndrome which is observed to be developed by adolescent Aces and hypothesized to be a form of coping mechanism for trauma.,,

Main Character,,0,,00,,False,,False,,If this were an anime you would be the main character. You were recently tested and found to have a high compatibility score with Valkyrie Cores. While slightly lacking in actual experience and knowledge with Valkyrie Frames you have the potential to become one of the very best Valkyrie pilots this world has ever known.,,
Student,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Unlike the previous origin you were tested and found to be compatible with Valkyrie cores at a younger age. You have spent the past few years educating and training yourself in preparation of your enrollment at one of the UN’s Valkyrie training academies.,,
Ace,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,You’re actually a third-year student whose flight was called to support the Alaskan Offensive. As a result, you have actual experience fighting real Antagonist forces as a Valkyrie pilot. The ability you showed in the fires of battle have earned you an Ace designation.,,
Instructor,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,Instead of being a cadet like the origins you are a fully qualified Valkyrie pilot assigned to teach at one of the three Valkyrie training academies. This is considered a form of vacation to avoid burn out from your regular duties as a member of the Three Hundred, though you may be called to assist one of the fronts if the situation calls for it. I hope you know what you are doing regarding teaching otherwise these cadets are going to die when they reach the battlefield.,,
Valkyrie Skill,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You have the training and knowledge in the operation of a Valkyrie frame. This includes basic skills such as synching and desynching with a Core, storing items and later expressing them, expressing your Valkyrie Frame and individual components, to more advance skills such as aiming and firing weapons, flying, shaping your Impeller Field, and other essential skills. Your level of skill and knowledge depends on your origin.%%%%First years only have relatively basic level knowledge and skills, while Aces have more advance levels reflective of you being a third-year and having actual battlefield experience rather than simulations. Instructors have expert and mastery level knowledge and skill which comes from being a veteran Valkyrie pilot and is required to properly teach cadets.,,

You also possess a mastery of basic and intermediate level Impeller techniques which includes skills such as inertial cancelling, Impeller layering and shaping, spatial manipulation and others. You also gain an intermediate understanding of more advance techniques such as teleportation and preventing it through interdiction. With a time and effort you will master advance Impeller techniques and perhaps even learn Wave Force an extremely powerful spatial manipulation attack developed by Anna.%%%%In addition when desynched you also naturally generate a weak Impeller field whose strength will grow over time and with training your manipulation of it will improve.%%%%%%Impeller fields are capable of all sorts of bullshit. They essentially act as exotic force fields at their most basic level.%%%%Your Impeller also allows you for the manipulation of object within its radius including the human body. It also allows you to perform various forms of spatial manipulation, such as teleportation, at the cost of current Impeller strength. Your Impeller constantly recharges, though the amount it recharges and your Impeller’s total strength is determined by a combination of the total number of hours synched to your Valkyrie Core, compatibility rating, total equipment integrated, and the complexity of that equipment.%%%%You will learn Wave Force and other Impeller techniques more quickly and easily with Impeller Mastery than you would with Pinnacle. Though you can still learn Wave Force without taking either perk but it will take a lot more time and effort and you may not even be ready to start learning it by the time you leave the jump.,,
Main Character - High Compatability,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You’re a main character so of course you are going to possess a natural initial high compatibility and synch rating with your Valkyrie Core. Post jump this gives you a high compatibility rating with other equipment and technology that require something similar such as Evangelions, Imperial Titans, Infinite Stratos, etc. Your synch rating will not be dangerously high if that is a concern with the technology you are synching with.,,
Main Character - Group Tactics,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,As a main character you’re going to be leading your flight and as such you possess a mastery at coordinating your squad mates in small group tactics.

This metal strain affects you far less than it normally would.%%%%Even with zero hours synched to your Valkyrie Core you would be able to stay synched for a month or an entire day of fighting before the mental strain becomes too much for you.,,
Student - 3D Native,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The human mind is largely conditioned to 2-dimensional movement but not you. You naturally think using 3-movement and therefore have become a master of aerial and zero gravity combat. You no longer become concerned about heights or what your orientation to the ground is. Fly for hours on your back or stomach? Dive straight down? Charge the enemy line while flying upside down? That doesn’t affect you in the slightest.%%%%Valkyries make their homes on the sky and that applies to you more than anyone.,,

Ace - The Bigger They Are,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Type Zeros are the single greatest threat humanity is currently facing. Monsters whose powerful attacks slaughter Valkyries in droves and utterly annihilate lessor forces. Each one comes equipped with a Higgs generator and a unique exotic principal weapon. It’s not hopeless as these monsters can be fought and killed.%%%%You now know how fight Type Zeros and other similarly strong enemies. Whether it is by figuring out weak points and attacking them, chipping away at them little by little, wearing them out, distracting them or by other methods. There is no guarantee you will actual be able to kill them but at the very least you should be able to survive any fights and either drive them back or successfully fall back yourself.,,
Instructor - Instructor Mom,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Anyone can teach, whether they are any good at it is a whole different story. You are considered such a great teacher that it’s almost like you are directly beaming information into your students’ minds. You can give riveting lectures that keep your students’ focus or perform hands on lessons that teach your students exactly what they need to know. You know when to be kind and encouraging and when to be harsh and demanding.

With time and a little work you’ll be able to make new cores.,,
Valkyrie Core and Frame,,2,,00,,True,,True,,All origins possess a Valkyrie Frame with the accompanying core. A Valkyrie Core is capable of storing, integrating, and improving technology and equipment. Its only limitations are storage capacity and complexity both of which grow with hours synced. Your initial storage and complexity is based on your origin with more experienced origins having more. The term Valkyrie Frame usually refers to core that has integrated a suit of enhanced power armor that has been equipped with thrusters, weapons, and other equipment. Technology foreign to this universe is harder to integrate and upgrade.%%%%Post jump this limitation disappears.%%%%%%A Valkyrie core is a white sphere whose size ranges from a golf to a tennis ball. When synched it is absorbed into the person’s body. A Valkyrie Core essentially comes with an ever expanding hammerspace that can store any nonliving objects into it as long as it has space.%%%%Any object can be repaired or improved while in storage space and any technology can be integrated allowing it to be used when either stored or expressed externally.%%%%Cores tend to develop personalities overtime but other than Durga’s occasional shows of sapience only Kandakara has demonstrated an actual human like personality during its failed attempts to communicate with Koujirou.,,
