Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Special,,0,,1000,,False,,False,,You got to Hakoniwa Academy on a scholarship, on account of your amazing skills in a specific subject, sport or activity. You’ve got no supernatural powers of your own, not for certain anyway, but you’re still beyond the level of a Normal person. You can choose one normal subject, such as a sport or field of learning, to be at the peak of world class ability in.,,
ABNORMAL,,0,,2000,,True,,False,,You’re one of the lucky few blessed with Abnormal ability. You’ve got a special power of some sort, gaining 200CP to spend in the Power section on Abnormalities only, not any other kind of Power. You’re also a very lucky person, though you might find that normal people are unnerved by your power and skill in most things. You’re treated very favourably by the school even if you don’t take active part in the Flask Plan so you don’t need to worry about attending class if you don’t want to.,,
[Minus],,0,,00,,False,,False,,A special kind of Abnormal, a Minus is someone who has gained their powers via some terrible events in their past, events that left them a broken, horrible thing. They thrive on causing misery to others, seemingly lacking any empathy or care for other people but in reality, this is mostly a front most of them put up. You will be a much more dour and miserable person but do not suffer the full brunt of being a Minus. You gain 200CP to spend in the Power section on Minus abilities only. You’ll find yourself in Class -13 with the other Minus, few of whom attend school regularly.,,
Not Equal,,0,,2000,,False,,False,,You are one of the creations of Ajimu Najimi, the godlike true creator of the Flask Plan. Created to act as one of her agents in Hakoniwa Academy, you’ve never been called into duty and thus have simply enjoyed your happy school life so far. You’ve got none of the attitude problems of the other origins but you may find yourself pressed into work alongside some fellow Not Equals later on. You’ve got 200CP to spend on the Power section for Not Equal powers only. Stylist ,,
Stylist,,0,,2000,,False,,False,,Created by one Fukurou Tsurubami, the Style is a separate power to any kind of Abnormality. Used via the language of words, you’ve been taught in this art since you were a child by Fukurou to act as an agent for him or some other powerful person in the world. For now, you’re completing your education at Hakoniwa Academy. You’ve got 200CP to spend in the Powers section on Styles only.,,
Medaka Sue,,1,,-12000,,True,,True,,Could there be any being as perfect as you? Only the youngest Kurokami heiress can match your natural abilities, all of which are described below.%%%% Your body, mind and spirit are all incredibly far beyond even the peak of human capability. You possess superhuman ability in adaptability, agility, analysis, awareness, attractiveness, balance, calculation, charisma, cognition, combat, competence, coordination, deduction, dexterity, durability, eloquence, endurance, flexibility, instinct, intelligence, intuition, invincibility, leadership, memory, meta-luck, mimicry, perception, persuasion, reasoning, reflexes, regeneration, senses, speed, strength, tactics, vitality, and willpower. To illustrate the sheer level of each of these traits, some examples follow. Your speed allows you to travel at Mach 20 with no training at all, strength enough to pull thousands of tons just by walking forward, charisma enough to get 98% of a student vote to become student president, regeneration to heal every single bone in your body from shattered to full health in ninety seconds and so on. These attributes will also scale up in the case of non-human species that have greater baselines for their average.%%%%Your learning rate is perhaps your most shocking ability. You are able to perfectly learn, memorize, recall, understand, master, and utilize anything and any skill by experiencing or observing it once, within seconds. Even things that take years or even decades for prodigies to learn, you can master, truly master, in just a few seconds. You also have no limitations on how far you can grow or learn, able to improve all skills and attributes and abilities without limit and with no loss in speed. You have total control over all parts of your body, including muscles, bones, flesh, blood, organs, nerves, hair, and veins. All of these can be consciously or subconsciously controlled, moved or adjusted, including improving them through thought to inhuman levels. This control is precise to an atomic level. This also allows you to be immune to any forced control of your physical body.%%%%Finally, you have a series of super modes that you can unlock over time. Each one greatly boosts the power of your physical abilities and all of your powers, though at first your initial mode will drive you to a mad fury whilst in it. As you grow and learn to use these, you will be able to retain control of your temper and even all other aspects of yourself, rendering you immune to any attempt to control your mind or body or spirit. Eventually you may even be able to keep yourself permanently within this form or to unlock new, unheard of forms based on the powers you have or that you encounter.,,
The Legendary Hero,,1,,-12000,,True,,True,,You were born as a being with the power and destiny to both save the world and to destroy it. Your physical form is far beyond any humans. You have the power to destroy the moon in a single blow, to travel faster than light with just your own two feet and several more unique powers on top.%%%%The first, imbuing your power into other objects. With this you can use your full power through anything you pick up. A flicked rubber band would hit with the greatest amount of power you could put out with a punch. You could poke someone with a pencil and blow a hole clean through them. Even the air around you can be used, a puff of air turning into a wave of destruction when it originates from you.%%%%The second, a great defence against all powers. No supernatural or superhuman ability, no matter how strong or strange, can affect you unless you allow it too. From simple super strength or attacking with the elements to the esoteric, such as warping reality or attempting to delete the concept of your existence, you are utterly unaffected. The sole exception are powers based in the power of language, spoken or written or signed abilities that work solely by being spoken or written or signed. The Styles of this world are one such example. In addition to this, once you have seen an attack against your person once, excepting one that is based in language as a Style is, it becomes useless and ineffectual against you, as you cease to recognise it as an attack. Obviously, if it failed to kill you the first time, it is nothing more than a bug sting.%%%%The final, the irreversible action. Any action you take or change you make or damage you deal can be made permanent and irreversible by your will. Wounds you make will never be repaired or healed or changed at all, no matter what is attempted to change them, though language based powers will bypass this too. If you were to break someone’s will, it would remain broken for all eternity. You may reverse this at any time as you will, though it will automatically do so upon your death. This also has a secondary use, in that any attack that hits you will be broken permanently. Swords will be shattered, arms left twisted, techniques rendered powerless and so on. The greater the attack, the worse it will be broken. An ordinary sword might only be left bent and rusted but an indestructible sword of arcane might would be reduced to a pile of dust.,,
Anshin'in,,1,,-12000,,True,,True,,A mysterious being has appeared once more in this world. A being that can’t be called human yet looks like one. The second member of the Najimi family has appeared and it’s none other than yourself Jumper. But what’s this? You don’t have any powers yet. How strange for such a high priced option. Perhaps you should wait a bit and see what appears to you. You see, the power of Anshin’in is not one that is immediately expressed but one that is infinite in time. The power to develop more powers, independently of anything else and at a rate that makes all things outside of it really quite silly.%%%%silly. You automatically develop new Abnormalities at a rate of 3,779 new powers per year. That’s about 10 new powers every 24 hours. A stunning rate isn’t it? Not all powers are equal however. The vast majority of powers that you gain are ultra-specific to your immediate thoughts and wishes at the time and quite limited in ability. Looking at yourself in the mirror one morning and wishing you didn’t need to use a razor to shave would give you Rather Razor [The shave facial hair from faces with a thought power] while wishing you could punish the driver who cut you off in traffic later that morning may give you Back Wheel Burnout [The ruin the back wheels of any car you can see power].%%%%Now and then, you can gain powers with greater scope and magnitude, especially if you are desperately needing them or have a great connection to the potential power. A lifelong pyromaniac stuck battling a foe in a dry forest has a good chance of developing Foolish Friendly Flames [The create and control fire power]. These good abilities are quite rare, especially if there’s no pressing need for them, and even more powerful abilities are even rarer. As you get older, in the scale of orders of magnitude older, better powers will begin to become more and more common for you to regularly develop.,,
Trampling On Your Dignity,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,If you’re going to send a message, you might as well do it in complete overkilling style. There’s really no other way to go about things. Whenever you want, you’re able to call up text in whatever font and size you want to float around you in the air, spelling out anything you want the words to spell out.,,
Clinging With Your Feet,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,A very strange martial art is the discipline of clinging to walls and ceilings with your feet, allowing you to walk on them as if they were the ground. You’ve become a master of this art, to the point of being able to use it even when you’re wearing shoes or piloting a mecha. Gravity only holds you down when you want it to. Or when you jump and stop holding on with your feet.,,
I Wanna Be the Strongest Hero,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,You’ve become the very star of the story. A regular Main Character. At least, you’ll be on the level of the current Main Character. This doesn’t confer any of the amazing power and talent that Medaka Kurokami has. Not at first anyway. Rather, you’ll find that taking on the role of a Main Character provides a wealth of benefits and challenges over time.%%%%Wherever you are, no matter the world, you’ll find yourself being dragged into and becoming an important part of the story. Becoming one of the first and most trusted allies of the protagonist, gaining hold of the McGuffin before anyone else does, being seen as the arch-villain by the hero, one way or another you’ll find yourself in a major position.%%%%This position will also result in you gaining many of the benefits that protagonists, mainly those of a shonen manga bent, are likely to run into.%%%%Powerful and trusted friends and allies gather around you and you’ve got an honestly absurd ability to convert your former opponents into new friends. You’ll find yourself encountering useful and special items or being chosen as the student of some famous and powerful figure in the world.%%%%When you encounter adversity, you’ll also encounter potential ways to overcome that adversity such as new power ups or weapons or techniques. Not always but they will make a big difference.%%%%You’ll even find yourself to have quite a lot of luck during the start and middle of the story, what some might call plot armour, which greatly assists you in surviving and thriving, though this cannot stretch forever.%%%%Whichever world you find yourself in, you’ll see that you receive about the same number and value of advantages that the local protagonist would receive, though quite rarely will they actually be the same advantages the local guy got. A blessed hero makes for a blessed you, while one more down on his luck will see your benefits faltering to match. In this world, you’d be matched against Zenkichi Hitoyoshi, vice president of the student council.%%%%If you are willing to pay an additional 300 CP over this perks’ base price, you will receive the same sort of busted unfairness of a Main Character like Medaka Kurokami herself. No longer limited to the level of the local big man, you’ll find yourself showered in blessings equal to the Heroine of Heroines herself. Superb powers awakening in you, brilliant teachers taking you under their wing, riches and treasures and relics almost beyond imagining making their way into your hands. More fortunate than the local protagonist would be the least you could expect. Medaka doesn’t play by anyone’s rules and it looks like you don’t either. That said, this might push that poor fellow hero out of place as the protagonist entirely though, leaving only you to take the stage and them as your supporting character at best.%%%%However, a Main Character doesn’t just float through life without any issue. As much as all this above stuff on the level the local protagonist got is nice, you also have to deal with the bad side of being the lead of a story. The challenges, the threats, the danger. From threat to life and limb to threats to your goals and mental state, you’ll have to deal with an equivalent level and sort of threat as the other main hero you’re sharing a story with. After all, you’re one of the protagonists here now too. As a Main Character, you’ll also find that your plot armour and luck from this perk will often leave you as the story draws nearer to the climax, as that is the time when it becomes much more possible to defeat the hero or villain of the story for good. It’s not going to guarantee your defeat but it will make it a much less certain thing than what it may normally be. Those who are aware of these sort of genre conventions or their own fictional natures will also be able to sense that you are a Main Character. They might find you a little obnoxious for it.%%%%This perk’s effects can be toggled on or off at the start of each jump, including both benefits and drawbacks to it, but the decision must be kept until the start of the next jump. The capstone booster part is unaffected by this toggle.%%%%This perk also acts as a Capstone Booster.,,Taken at second tier
Special - Darling Knight,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Nothing can be nobler than the pursuit of love. Such a shame that most pursuits go unrewarded or even outright ignored! Your own efforts are much more likely to get rewarded however. Your romantic aims much more easily achieved. Those you are interested in find themselves at least a tiny bit open to the idea, even if they’d normally not even consider it, and any gifts or favours you do for them for the purpose of gaining their affections will be far better received than they normally would. Something that would have not even gained a reaction might be well appreciated, whilst a gift that already touched someone’s heart might make them fall for you outright.,,
Special - Shoujo Prince,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,They don’t call you a prince for nothing. You’ve got the sort of stunning good looks to make yourself stand out even on a world stage. No doubt half your schoolmates are crushing on you, from either side of the gender line too. Not only that but these effortless good looks really are as effortless as they seem. You don’t need to spend any time at all in the morning preparing, you’ll find yourself looking, smelling and feeling just as good waking up as if you’d spent a few hours at a luxury spa each morning. You’ll also find that most things you do have your beauty in them as well, ranging from having innately gorgeous handwriting to producing much prettier pieces of art.,,
Special - Special Body,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You might not be a true Abnormal but one part of you certainly makes an effort to match them. Choose a single organ or part of your body such as your arms or legs to be made abnormally good in its function. Perhaps you choose your lungs and become able to hold your breath for a month through sheer lung capacity, focus your exhalation into a cannon that can blow a man across a large room or scream loud enough to kill someone outright. Pick your legs and you could jump ten stories with ease, shatter concrete with the force of your legs or use yourself as a living jack to keep two shrinking walls of a room apart. You may buy this perk multiple times, with further purchases at a discount that does not stack. The only limit is that you cannot choose your brain as the part to be enhanced.,,
Special - Living Library,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Won’t ever have a need of study again, not for school and god be willing, not for life either. You’ve got a quite literally perfect memory. You memorise anything on experiencing it with any of your senses once, even for a flash. There is no limit to how much memory you can store at a time and even instantly recall any information that you have memorised with no delay, as if you had already been thinking of it. Of course, given that you’ve lived with this for years now, you’ve long since memorised a vast amount of information, both academic, practical and trivial.,,
Special - Maestro,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Now you might not be all that special on your own, really, but you’ve got a tendency to make all those around you that much more amazing. You’re able to draw out the true potential of those around you that you care for and spend lots of time with, both in regards to their powers and even them as people. So long as you are constantly around someone that you have a good relationship with, you’re able to slowly bring out their true powers, increasing their maximum power by up to three times their normal level if you’ve spent a few months with them. You’ll also find that they begin to get over mental and emotional issues with ease so long as you keep talking to them, though this is mostly based on what they see as a problem. This increased power and sense of self will slowly drain if you cease to constantly spend time with a person, draining to nothing by the end of a full month.,,
Special - Zero,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You’re no Abnormal but neither are you Normal. As a Special, you defy any sort of real categorisation, only being able to be known as not that but also not that either. It seems like this defiance of any kind of label allows you to dodge out of the way of effects that target specific categories of beings rather than affecting everything as normal. Something that would only affect Abnormals wouldn’t touch you but neither would something that affects humans only or males only if you are a male. If something doesn’t affect a particular type of being, that won’t have any relevance here. It’s only when the attack or ability targets or gains advantage against specific sorts of beings that you are able to shimmy out of the way.,,
Special - Imagination Creation,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Children do indeed have the most active of imaginations.%%%%Yours has far surpassed what any child shrink would think was reasonable though, becoming so superhumanly strong that you can manifest your imagination into reality. You can imagine a devilish blade to kill monsters into existence in your hands or think up a gigantic, terrifying beast from hell to attack your enemies.%%%%Almost anything can be done so long as you obey the limits of imagination. The strength, size and quantity of what you create is limited by your willpower, too much and you’ll strain yourself to unconsciousness.%%%%The second limitation is that your creations remain dependent on your imagination. You must constantly focus on your creations to maintain them, as a stray thought can alter or outright destroy them.%%%%The last is that your creations will also be influenced by the imaginations of those around you who, while their wills are reduced in comparison to your own towards affecting your creations, can still influence it if they have great enough wills or a large enough number of people to counter your own willpower.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Imagination Creation- Active imagination isn’t enough to describe what you are now, you’re just straight out crazy. Your delusions aren’t things you really need to think on to have them stick around and now, neither are the things you imagine into existence. Your imagination creations are no longer so dependent on your constant concentration to exist, though you do still need to think about them every few days to keep them from disappearing. You’ll also find that what you make is proof against the influence of any other minds, as your outright madness rebuffs any attempt to change its mind.,,
Special - King of Fouls,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Fair? Don’t kid yourself Jumper. You’re Special for sure but that’s still nothing compared to an Abnormal or Minus. If you want to have a say in how the story goes, you’re going to need to get dirty. You’re going to need to Cheat, so it’s good that you’re the best Cheater there ever was. No matter what it is or what you’re doing, you’re able to find a cheat to greatly improve your chances at something. These won’t improve your own ability, only make the tasks you’re trying your hand at easier. Finding a secret, unobserved shortcut in a race, finding some extra special ingredients to make your potions easier to brew and stronger overall, even getting opportunities to easily and sneakily poison or disable enemies before big, pre-set battles. You’ll always get a chance to cheat, so long as you’re willing to cheat.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Cheat? Why would you ever need to cheat when other people do it for you. The world itself has decided that you deserve a leg up and will act to give you an unfair advantage even when you go into things completely unprepared. Enemies suddenly become sick, you run across totally unfair magical weapons to use in battle, the answers to your big final exam are just left in your desk by a mysterious benefactor and more. Even if you’re not trying to cheat, you’ll find yourself constantly a few steps ahead of your peers and if you add your own actual cheating on top, you can beat even those super-powered Abnormals with ease.,,
ABNORMAL - NEVER GROW UP,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Abnormals by their nature are rather childish people. Too caught up in super powered battles to focus on the important things in the world, forgetting the power of adults. You’re not too worried though. Youth should be enjoyed even in old age, something it looks like your power agrees with. Your abilities do not decay or disappear as you age, whether this is from the passing of time or from the actual act of growing up. Your body won’t degrade either, maintaining its physical and mental fitness even as you near the end of your days, and you’ll find that your cosmetic age becomes quite a graceful thing over time.,,
ABNORMAL - YOU ARE GORGEOUS,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Those who succeed all the time will inevitably encounter that classic opponent- the one jealous of the successful people in the world. The sorts of people who look at those blessed with talent, good looks and good fortune and just feel envy. But when they look at you, they see something truly special. Rather than being disliked for being special, unique or blessed beyond the norm, you will find that most people like you more for it. When they might envy you normally, now they will be inspired by you. Even those who truly hate the sort of being that you are will consider you a small exception.,,
ABNORMAL - LET'S MURDER SOMEONE,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,A bunch of knives, a spear, a sword, a rocket launcher, a club larger than your actual body- how the heck are you fitting all of this under your clothes? It’s almost like you have some sort of pocket dimension through which to store a truck’s worth of size inside the hidden spots on your body. In reality, you’re just supernaturally good at hiding things on your body, even if the space is inside your mouth or under your armpit. You still have the weight of the things hidden on you but they are entirely undetectable and able to be instantly withdrawn when you desire it, as well as working as an incredibly effective training weight system that will rapidly train your physical strength and speed.,,
ABNORMAL - ALL ABOUT ME,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You are not the sort of man that just bows down to another. Even if the entire universe was bearing down at you, you’d spit in its’ face and extol your infinite virtues with the utter certainty that all who heard would be amazed. That sheer self-confidence you possess has made your mind into an impenetrable bastion as well. It is impossible to enter or influence your mind unless you allow others to do so. Any attempt to read, control, change or even attack your mind is effortlessly rebuffed and made into a mockery. It’s not even possible to change your mind with charisma, manipulation or trickery unless you wish to open yourself up to such things. You can just set yourself to a decision and obstinately ignore any and all influence.,,
ABNORMAL - MASTER OF THE MIND AND BODY,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,An Abnormality is in a sense, just another part of your body, controlled by you as if it were another limb. For some it grows to be a little more than that, though still most definitely a part of you. You’re able to set your powers to operate automatically and independently of your own mind, giving them a limited awareness of your body and the area around you. These powers still draw from you for any costs but will otherwise act automatically to protect and serve you. You may set as many powers to this state as you wish and reverse it at any time. A power to control the elements could form into shields or attacks against those hostile to you for example. These powers can only sense for a few feet around you on their own but otherwise act as if you were controlling them in regards to speed of reactions and skill of use.,,
ABNORMAL - THEY ARE MINE AND MINE ALONE,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Perhaps you can no longer lose your powers due to your own growing up but it’s still possible for people to take them away from you by force. Or at least it was before you made it known how much you refuse to let go of what you consider yours. It’s impossible to degrade or take away your abilities in any shape or form, even on a merely temporary basis. Attempts to weaken, nullify, disable, steal, destroy or do any other sort of negative thing to your powers or the energies that they run on will find themselves not even touching you. It seems like our powers really are too integral to your being to ever be taken away from you.,,
ABNORMAL - ROOT OF ALL GENIUS,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The greatest minds of our world didn’t make their great discoveries when they lived happy, peaceful lives. They made them in times of war, after living through hell themselves. Or at least that’s the view of a certain young genius. The worse the situation you find yourself in or the more miserable you are on a personal level, the better you and your powers will get. A little constant annoyance won’t make much discernable difference but constantly subjecting yourself to tortures and poisons and purposefully ruining your relationships with those you love, all the while reaching the climax of the villain’s evil plan, and you could dwarf your original power, so long as you kept yourself in that situation.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Wonderful as war and misery may be for advancement and growth, it should never be the ideal to strive towards. One day, everyone should be able to find such growth even in peace time, something it seems you’ve gained a hold of early. The better your mood or the situation you are in, the better you and your powers get. Operating in reverse to the normal, it’ll ensure you’re always just a bit better than normal whether you’re feeling great or in the dumps.,,
ABNORMAL - ABNORMAL GROWTHS,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Abnormalities disappear, usually anyway, once the user reaches adulthood. They grow out of ending such silly delusions and become properly grown adults. But until that point, the Abnormalities grow stronger and stronger as the children grow nearer to maturity. Your powers do the same as well now, slowly growing in power and utility as you age. They’ll improve in power and effectiveness, possibly even gaining new side abilities or uses as time goes on. However, any innate drawbacks to the power, if it has any, will grow alongside it. Thus, you may choose which powers will grow with age and when to stop this growth effect, though it will not stop any of them disappearing with age.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Growing is not enough for you anymore, only improvement will be accepted. Whilst your abilities will still grow over time if you want them to, you’ll find that now the drawbacks to them will slowly decrease over time as well. Costs get less costly, strain becomes easier to bear and even limits like requiring specific materials or items to use might one day be lifted, though such integral things may take a while to get done.,,
[Minus] - [Guest Artist],,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,All the kids have their own style these days. A new way of being drawn, a new way of speaking, something to really make them stand out from all the other Jump characters. You can sell out and join the trend now too! You’re able to freely change your art style and speech font to whatever you want, even basing it on some of the classic artist’s work of the past. Of course, given how these things are usually designed to be in a manga, appearing very different visually may terrify those around you and different word fonts may make you sound very strange. But isn’t it worth it when it makes you stand out to your readers?,,
[Minus] - [Minus Me],,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,A Minus is a Minus in all aspects of life, from the way they make their breakfast to the very way they breathe. Their nature surrounds them like a dark cloud, making it known to all what they are. You’ve got this aura of nastiness and grime too, a sense about you that makes everyone miserable and feel awful, though unlike most Minus you are able to control whom your aura affects and whether to have it active at all. It’s strong enough to quite badly stress people out and those of weak wills or temperaments may find themselves getting physically sick when around you.,,
[Minus] - [Birds of a Feather],,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,They flock together. You find yourself drawn to those like you in various ways, as they do back to you. These people may be like you in regards to your personality, your body, your powers or a mix of all three. Whatever it is, they’ll become almost effortless friends and allies, as you find yourself easily befriending them and anyone else that shares similarities with you. Even people that would normally hate you or never want to be friends with you can be rather easily charmed to start to like you if you share a few traits. The more alike you are with someone, the easier it is to create strong and lasting bonds with them and to deepen that relationship further.,,
[Minus] - [Born Bad, Grew Up Worse],,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You were born weak, contemptible and pathetic. Others looked down on you for it but you knew it for something more. A strength that let you see all the many flaws of other people, because of your deep familiarity with those same weaknesses. With just a single glance, you can pick out every flaw, weakness and hole that someone has. Be it in their powers, their fighting style, their personality or their body, you know of every flaw that they have, even ones not related to things you know, such as them being aesthetically un-pleasing despite having no experience in fashion or beauty. No matter how someone might try to hide it, you’re able to see it. This even works on objects or organisations, allowing you to pick out all the holes and cracks to take advantage from.,,
[Minus] - [Reversed],,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It’s an old tradition of the Shiranui family to create doubles of important people, persons who act as shadows for their chosen targets and both support them and work to ensure they act in the way that they are supposed to. You are as adaptable a doppelganger as Hansode herself.%%%%Every ten years, you are able to choose a single figure within a setting to become a double of. For any effects that target a person specifically, you will also count as valid. A spell that can only affect one man might now be able to affect you as well, as you count as being that same man for all intents and purposes. You also find yourself with a great and yet unexplainable advantage against them in battle, enough to defeat someone that should normally defeat you with only a small amount of trouble. Lastly, any who like or love the person you have chosen will find themselves feeling a similar amount of affection towards you, though without your encouragement or a special kind of personality on their part, they may work their way over this copied affection.,,
[Minus] - [The Bear Himself],,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Nothing in the world could hope to match you in the sheer, pitiable, contemptuous lack of worth that you have. Truly there are none as pathetic as you. But in a way, that can benefit you. Because there are none that can hope to approach your lack of worth, it seems that no one can try to be you at all. Whether it be you as a whole or just the things you have, such as your body or your powers, people are not able to copy you. For worse, you are unique, and any attempt to mimic or copy you will fail as everyone knows which one is you, even if just from the aura of shame and misery.%%%%%%Boosted:%%If people want to be like you so badly, why not let them? When someone attempts to copy you, you can infect them back with a little bit of yourself, without letting them copy you successfully. They’ll start acting a bit more like you and even agreeing with you more often than not. Each attempt and the more each attempt at copying tries to copy, the worse this will be. Try too much and they might just turn into a person who honestly believes in everything you say and think as the right way to do things.,,
[Minus] - [Jumper System],,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Mighty as an Minus can be, it is only once they move beyond just swimming in their own despair that they become truly strong. Whether it be growing as a person to be more than just a negative or to expanding their powers to more than just a single instance, growth remains the most vital. You’re able to simulate the latter at least, through the creation of Systems. Groups of two or three powers working in step with each other. This allows you to partially combine those abilities, sharing traits between them. Combining an ability that allows you to automatically react to and block attacks with one that allows you to control an element such as fire or earth would then let you have your elemental power automatically act to defend you.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Your power combinations become much more than the sum of their parts now. When you combine your powers in the above fashion, you will also gain additional abilities that complement that combination. The original example of combining an automatic reaction power and one that controls fire would then be complemented by an ability to attack at range, allowing your fire powers to be automatically used even distantly from you. These additional powers will only work with your combined abilities and never outshine them, what they will do is expand their utility and breadth of use, such as advancing your fire-ice power into also having true wind manipulation.,,
Not Equal - Choose Your Victory,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It might not be a perfect replacement for the feeling of being genuinely defeated but perhaps for your purposes, it might still suffice. You’re able to lose at anything you want and make that loss utterly convincing and genuine to all who see it. While you can lose at anything, this only applies to situations where you are genuinely losing. Trying to lose at losing and similar abuses will just see you fail overall instead of somehow pull out a win from nothing.,,
Not Equal - Call Me Anshin'in,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Names are important in any world, even those without supernatural word language powers. Just getting called what you feel is fitting can make all the difference to you on a bad day. You’re able to freely decide the name that everyone calls you, changing that knowledge that everyone you have met or knows your name has. If you want to suddenly be called something completely different to what you usually are, it won’t erase you from the minds of people that knew you before or make those who’d never heard your original name suddenly know you, but everyone who knew your name before will now believe your new name to be that original name.,,
Not Equal - Powerpedia,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The more you stack up, the more confusing it gets to keep them all sorted. You’re probably already in the habit of collecting a wide array of abilities and it’ll only get worse from here. So it’s good that you’re now able to not only have a complete awareness of every ability and power that you have at all times but also all of their potential uses and combinations with each other. Even creative, obscure combinations between two seemingly irrelevant powers are immediately revealed to you upon possessing both of them.,,
Not Equal - Flimsy Paper,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Never been much for a stable view on life or reality, you’ve got a sense for when the medium around you has changed. You’ve grown used to the constant feeling of creation as some author writes you into a story but when an unplanned change happens, you’re always aware of how and when that change has occurred. When someone warps or alters reality in the setting that you are in, you are instantly aware of that event’s time, place and what has been changed.,,
Not Equal - Concept Ball,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,When two combatants reach a certain level of power, fighting becomes a bit pointless. When both of you are Immovable Objects and Unstoppable Forces, you’re just going to be pointlessly nudging against each other. Well, if you were equal you would be. But you’re Not Equal. Whenever your own abilities that are meant to be without peer come into conflict with another such ability, yours trumps theirs. A blow that can pierce anything will tear through a defence that can block anything when you are using it. Your absolutes are more so, simply for the fact that you are the one using them.,,
Not Equal - Equality Through Inequality,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,By your very nature, you are already a being of contradictions. Both Pluses, Minuses and everything in between are open to you. So why not excuse any other contradictions in yourself? You can live just fine even with mutually exclusive parts of your being co-existing. You can have two sets of powers that shouldn’t co-exist together and see no complications at all, use two different kinds of energy through the same route without issue, have two exclusive personality traits at the same time without driving yourself to insanity and even be two exclusive physical things at once and retain only the benefits of each. A Not Equal hardly has to obey logic when it comes to their own form.,,
Not Equal - Gotta Have Power to Get Power,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Once you’ve had a taste, you can’t help but want another and another and another. Power is an addiction, one that the world seems all too happy to feed into you. The more power you gain, the easier and faster it will be to gain more power. Personal power, supernatural power, political power, financial power, any sort of power or influence on the world around you will become easier and easier to gain as you gain more of that sort of power. At the early stages, this can be as simple as growing faster or finding more sudden bursts of inspiration but later on you may find yourself gaining powerful mentors, finding great riches every day or even, eventually, just spontaneously developing new powers now and then.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Just having power at all extends your influence into all aspects of life. Just having power in one area will now make it easier for you to gain power in all areas that can apply. It won’t be quite as good as the base perk in that area, having a great deal of financial power will still make it far easier to gain supernatural power but not as much as if you were solely focusing on supernatural power, but increasing your power in all fields will ultimately add up to far more than normal.,,
Not Equal - Window in the Wall,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,What were you again? Were you a character from the manga written by one Nisio Isin? Were you from the anime adaptation by Gainax? Ooh, maybe you’re the self-insert of some normal person back on Earth doing a Jum-------%%%%Hm. Maybe you are just a manga character after all.%%%%Whatever you are, you’re well aware of your nature and your author. That mythical thing, the Fourth Wall, isn’t so much a myth as it is a flimsy paper barrier to you. Something you can poke your head through, at least in a limited way. You’re fully aware of your fictional nature and the fictional nature of those around you, having an innate sense for the many tropes and clichés that are currently in effect around you. You’re not limited to what the author might write you to do either. Those tropes you became aware of? You’re very good at subverting or twisting them. You know who the main character of a story is but you can easily swap the story to focus on one of the other main characters as the hero instead. You can even change the genre or mood of the overall story with just a little work. These changes to the tropes or genre of the story take a few days to take effect once you’ve desired them though. As a side effect, your awareness of your own nature renders you totally independent of your creator/author, making you immune to any attempts to control or effect you through such a bond or even to erase you by destroying the fictional thing in which you are found.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Before now, you just took peeks through the wall. Now you can hop out of it entirely. Your level of influence is greatly increased, to the point that you can briefly cease to be ‘fictional’ in the sense that these various worlds care for. In a story using words or pictures, like a manga or novel, you can peel yourself off the pages and jump ahead or back a few chapters to travel in time. You could lean out of the anime episode you are featured in to press pause on the remote to stop time. You can even alter the words written to change reality, though how this actually manifests can be very chaotic and unpredictable, as well as rarely long lasting. You’re even able to communicate with the author of the current work you are in, attempting to get them to change things to your liking, though this’ll likely freak them the fuck out. It is sadly impossible to get an author to change you yourself, since you are your own author already, and attempts to sneak around this limitation before your chain ends might have you end up meeting the rather stern and powerful editor of your story. You can’t stay out of the fiction you are in for too long or destroy it either, not without destroying yourself. It’s impossible to destroy the fiction you are in, through your own actions or through getting someone else to do it for you, at least until your chain has ended.,,
Stylist - Verbal Hurricane,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You’ve been playing word games since you were a baby, just to prepare you better for eventually learning your own Style. You can handle even the most convoluted of tongue twisters with ease, never slip up in your word talking no matter how fast you talk and have an immense ability with languages. You know over a hundred different tongues with ease and find it takes no more than a few weeks to become entirely fluent in new languages, with a particular focus on learning all the weirdest little tricks and vocabulary of that language.,,
Stylist - The New Chess,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Never worry about finding yourself and your friends on a bored afternoon again. You’re a genius at creating games to amuse or challenge yourself or others, through almost any medium imaginable. Physical sport games, card games, games linked to the supernatural powers that you or others have. They’ll be well made, with fair rules without loopholes or easy cheats unless you desire them to be and most of all, they’ll actually be pretty fun to play even on your own. Good Style practice too if you go for the word games.,,
Stylist - New Testament,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You can make as many plans as you want for things but you won’t always be able to put them into motion. Being cut in half does that to you. Now you can put in a little insurance. You’re able to set conditions for any power or ability that you possess, including things like spells, to activate based on conditions. You can set a fireball to activate on a time delay, have a shield spell go off when you’re hurt beyond a certain level or even have a self-destruct ability automatically occur when you die even if you wouldn’t have time to activate it. Each ability can only have a single condition at a time and each condition takes a minute of concentration to set, needing to be replaced once the condition is fulfilled once. Conditions must also relate to single use cases.,,
Stylist - Ultra Husbandry,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,If you can’t have the girl you pine for, just breed a new one by manipulating your first crush into marrying into an acceptable gene pool and grooming the child to your liking. It makes perfect romantic sense. You’re an expert at breeding living beings and at grooming them into the desired state. When you create offspring with another person or personally and directly organise the coupling of two separate beings, you are able to dictate which traits of the parents are passed on, including things that might not normally be passed on like personality traits that the parents gained from socialisation and that have no genetic markers. You’re also amazingly good at raising children, particularly in moulding them into being specific sorts of people and having specific likes and loves and loyalties. Trust me, it’s not creepy at all.,,
Stylist - Unravelling,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Sprinting is great and all, really, but it’s not much use in life. How often is raw speed in that sense going to help, in anything from typing to fighting? But it looks like it’s actually quite fitting for you. The faster you become in raw movement speed, the faster you are able to do any task at all. Becoming able to move faster than the speed of sound would let you accomplish hours of work in just minutes, with no loss in quality, consideration or effective time spent on the project. You’ll be moving and acting faster but be just as effective as if you took as much time as you normally would on the task you’re working on.,,
Stylist - Hyper Signing,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,A Style is based on communicating. Words are integral to the art and those unable to comprehend language, permanently or temporarily, are unaffected by the Style. But is it really so important? Language is hardly limited to just the verbal medium. You’re able to use your Styles, and any other sort of verbal power, without the need for words. So long as your target is within audible range of you, you can use Styles or other verbal effects on them without doing anything but thinking the words in your mind. Even if they could not ordinarily comprehend language, it will still work on them. A side benefit of this all is that you are able to perfectly communicate with people in the same manner, getting across exactly what you mean even to those normally unable to understand language, just so long as they can see you and you can think. Real advanced body language there.,,
Stylist - Realism Lifehack,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,This isn’t some Shonen Jump story you know. This is the Real Deal now. At least it is around you. You’re able to force things around you to obey the rules of reality, at least when it comes to the meta-story of the world you are in. You won’t stop magic from working but you will stop it from breaking the established rules it works by. You won’t stop people from trying to do heroic sacrifices for each other but you will make it every bit as lethal as it should be in real life, greatly reducing their chances of surviving. The heroes won’t get saved by sudden Deus Ex Machina while you’re around, unless it is actually God or someone intervening on purpose. Main characters don’t have any special importance or protection and so on. When you are around, everyone plays without tropes, clichés or plot armour.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Well, everyone used to have to play without any help. Life’s always been unfair though and now you can choose who and even which specific things are affected by your powers. If you want to benefit fully from genre conventions whilst all your enemies are left in the dust, you do you. If you want to disable just the bit where people get last minute power ups but leave everything else, also just fine.,,
Stylist - Doctor Stylish,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Styles are quite special, even among Skills. Makeable, if you know the right way, and capable of just as much power and even some things Skills cannot do. You’re a Stylist equal to Fukurou, the creator of Styles, himself. Just by constantly using, considering and playing with a certain phrase, idiom, way of using words or other word-related game, you can create new styles. Things on the level of Provocation Style might take just a few weeks whilst a mid-level style like Label User or Kanji user might take months of repetition. The high level stuff can take years or even longer to make, such as Contradictory Conjunction, but is still possible if you are patient and uninterrupted in your work. You’ll also find that you effortlessly master any sort of word-based supernatural power, possessing much more strength than any of your peers would with the same sorts of powers at your normal level.%%%%%%Boosted:%%The next step of Styles is to take them from being original to converting other things into Styles. You’re able to create new Styles by converting existing power and abilities you have into Styles, though this does not remove the original version of the power. The power will still require any energy or material costs as normal and possesses most of the same drawbacks but any sort of physical action required or time requirement is reduced to just a few words needing to be spoken by you. You could be able to cast any of your fire spells simply by saying Fire with different inflections and tones or unleash barrages of blasts of kinetic forces by reciting technique names from martial arts.,,
ABNORMALITIES - SUPERHUMAN DESIRE,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You always wanted to be special and that want was itself so strong that you really did become so. Whenever you are subjected to a procedure that will improve or beneficially alter you with a chance of injury to you, death or even just the procedure failing outright, it will instead have a guaranteed chance of success. Risky operations will always go off without a hitch, shoving an energy source into your own body will have it combine with you successfully if there was even the smallest chance of you not dying.,,
ABNORMALITIES - DANCING DANGER,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Magic weapons? Of course they exist. You didn't think that a world as strange as this would only have strange people and not strange objects, right? Possessing this Abnormality allows you to use magical weapons that would normally only be wieldable by specific people or specific types of people as if you were the right sort of person. You'll also find yourself easily mastering the use of any such magical weapons.,,
ABNORMALITIES - MODEL JUMPER,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You won’t get in over your head on account of arrogance anymore, though you should still watch out for your foes being stronger than you expected. With this Abnormality, you are constantly aware of your own limits in all things. You know exactly how strong you are in every way, how skilled you are in everything and so on. You’ll know this in both an objective sense and in comparison to anyone whose power or skills you are familiar with.,,
ABNORMALITIES - FAIRNESS,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You’re as impartial as impartial can be. Your abnormality allows you to enter or exit a state in which you are completely free of any bias and act with total impartiality. Everyone who sees you in this state will know that you are genuinely impartial too, allowing you to serve as an entirely fair judge and referee for anything they care to name.,,
ABNORMALITIES - PARASITE SEEING,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,When you see someone, you’re now able to see as they see instead of how you see them seeing. The moment you activate this ability, you will be able to view what anyone you are currently looking at can see, as well as how they view the world in a mental sense. You’ll understand their world view and emotions and thoughts by using this power, which also turns your eyes red and glowing when you do activate it.,,
ABNORMALITIES - AUTO PILOT,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You’re able to set your body to work independent of your mind, letting it defend, attack and act solely based on your reflexes. No longer reliant on your reaction times or what you notice and focus on, your body will move perfectly and at full speed to attack, dodge, block or reach any foe or action you could normally do whilst your mind is free to think independent of this. Your body is still slaved to your senses however and cannot move faster than it normally could, only better, and thus it remains possible to trick your reflexes, though if you choose to focus on your actions at the same time as you have Auto Pilot active, you can erase this problem and increase your effectiveness even more. You can turn this Auto Pilot on and off.,,
ABNORMALITIES - READING MINDS,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You’re able to receive electrical signals given off by humans or machines and interpret those signals, effectively allowing you to read the minds of any being with a brain or thing with electronics. It’s possible to focus your power instead of just taking in everything around you at once, something you may want to do given how difficult it can be to sort out all the signals at once, but your targets being in poor conditions can muddle the signals and make it harder to interpret what they will do. Focusing too much on one person can force you to feel their physical and emotional pain, so be careful to not go too far. On the other hand, possessing this power allows you to greatly increase the power of any electricity-based powers that you or those you are in contact with possess.,,
ABNORMALITIES - DEVIL STYLE,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Those Main Characters better watch out because you’re about to take away one of their biggest advantages. Around you or in things you are involved with, you remove the influence of fate and luck. Plot armour ceases to be a thing, lucky coincidences never happen and fate and destiny are barred from having any effect on the actions of any involved. Around you, it comes to the individuals’ own actions to decide the fate of the world and not any unseen force of luck or fate.,,
ABNORMALITIES - MOTHER'S TASK,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Never has there ever been a mom like you. When it comes to any sort of skill that might be considered motherly, womanly or involved in raising children, you’re an unparalleled master to supernatural levels. Gardening? You can snip unnaturally tough vines at supersonic speeds. Cooking? You can cook a three course meal for dozens of people in just minutes. Sewing? You could totally change the style of the clothes someone was wearing before they noticed you were changing the style, with just a needle and thread.,,
ABNORMALITIES - ERROR MESSAGE PLATE,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,A power to rule all rulers. You are able to create sticky cards on a whim and when attached to the head of someone who desires control, over other people or organisations or things in general, it allows you to command them as your own slaves. Those controlled will not be aware of the control, though they will appear to be slightly drunk to any who see them. You can control as many as you can attach cards to but you cannot make them do something you do not want them to do, even on a subconscious level. If you order someone to kill but subconsciously dislike the idea of them killing, you will be unable to order them to kill. Of course, if someone loses the desire to control others, the card will fall off of their head and if someone removes the card, they’ll be freed from your control just as well.,,
ABNORMALITIES - KILLING IMPULSE,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Born to kill, you’re better than anyone can be at it. You’ve got an instinctual desire to kill everything you see but unlike Munakata, you are in full control of this desire. The benefits you gain? That same desire results in an effortless mastery of every form of killing. You are naturally talented in the extreme at all forms of combat, assassination and murder and find it even easier to improve your talents to greater, physics-defying degrees such as becoming good enough with a sword to cut through sound. You are also exceptionally good at avoiding being killed, knowing exactly how to maximally reduce the damage you take from blows, even if you can only shift a few inches at the time.,,
ABNORMALITIES - EROTIC PERRIOT,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,It's the basest instinct of all humanity but they just can't deny it when you raise the issue. You are able to create and control lust in any being near you, raising, lowering, making mental or physical lust be given to someone or even focusing it entirely on specific people or things. You can make someone entirely pervious to carnal desires, lacking them entirely, or fill someone up with so much lust that they turn into an unthinking, berserking animal in their eagerness to satisfy themselves. These feelings can be resisted by those with strong enough wills but you can continuously stack more and more lust feeling into someone to make it harder and harder to concentrate on anything but resistance.,,
ABNORMALITIES - UNKNOWN HERO,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,You’ve been blessed with superhuman strength, so much so that it terrifies all those around you to an unbelievable extent. You’re able to knock down buildings with a single blow and take tank shells to the face with naught but a grin to show for it. And that innate fear? It looks like anyone not at least as strong as you becomes so scared of your strength that you are removed from their senses and memories unless you specifically point yourself out. If someone as strong as you or stronger points you out, everyone else in the area will be able to see you until you leave but even if you are actively attacking those weaker than you, so long as you have not been pointed out, they won’t be able to figure out how they’re being hurt.%%%%If you spend another 200CP, you can gain the Theme Song power in addition to Unknown Hero. This will make it so that you’re able to, for a few minutes at a time before tiring yourself out, move at the speed of light itself. You can a series of striking black tiger stripes over your skin when you activate this mode. It also allows you to create several very short lived but entirely physical clones at will. Even if you do not purchase this upgrade, you will be able to deactivate the fear aura you have at will.,,Taken at second tier
ABNORMALITIES - REMODELLING,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Why be satisfied with just what you were born with when you can make improvements? Through a variety of methods of experimentation, you are able to directly improve the power and efficiency of living beings or inanimate objects by remodelling them. This can be as simple as making an animal not afraid of powerful people or as complex as turning someone into a powerful cyborg or bringing out latent Abnormal or Minus powers within your own brain, given you can use Remodelling on yourself just as easily. There’s not much of a limit on how much you can improve someone but it will take more and more resources the crazier and stronger the changes you are making are.,,
ABNORMALITIES - ANALYSIS,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Understanding is by far the most important thing. Once you know what you’re dealing with, you can formulate a plan to deal with it. You’re just great at both. You’re able to effortlessly and intuitively analyse and understand anything that you can see or touch. The more complex or strange the thing is, the more time you might need to understand it, but even Abnormalities can be figured out with a few caresses and a couple seconds of consideration. Your understanding tells you how and why anything you’ve analysed works and then gives you the knowledge on how best to bring out its full potential, letting you turn people or objects into the best they can be over time, so long as they’re open to your training plans.,,
ABNORMALITIES - AERO BIKER,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Everyone needs to breathe and thus controlling what they breathe allows you to control everyone. It might not be as faultless logic as you hope but controlling oxygen still makes you quite the terrifying opponent. You’re able to control all oxygen within a few hundred metres of yourself, letting you suffocate or attack people as you will. You can even use it to oxidise metal and meat or manipulate people’s health by precisely altering their oxygen levels. Or just blow them up from the inside out by greatly expanding the oxygen in their bodies. Makes a mess though, even if its nice hearing them choke on their own blood.,,
ABNORMALITIES - QUARTER HAZARD,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,All life has water in it. All life that you know of anyway. It's a vital part of biology and to someone who can control it, a lethal weapon. You are not able to control all water without limit, instead you are only able to manipulate the volume of water in anything. So long as the water source you are manipulating is within a stadium's worth of area to you, you are able to massively increase or decrease the amount of water in a water source. You can double or half the amount of water there for every second that you focus on a specific source, easily enough to instantly kill most humans from the sudden increase off pressure from inside their bodies or cause widespread destruction to a city.,,
ABNORMALITIES - WIEGHTED WORDS,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are able to emit and control electrical signals, giving you the power to interfere with and even rewrite the minds of others. With just a word, so long as your target has a physical brain, you can command them to do whatever you want without a chance of them resisting. Only by approaching your level of power can they have a chance of resisting these immediate commands. By totally focusing on someone however, you can brainwash them over time even if they’re as strong as you, though they can try to resist or fight back against you. Once brainwashed, they’ll act like however you wanted them to, though it’s possible to be broken out of the brainwash by someone else. You can also use this power to manipulate electronics and machines, whether it be commanding their programming or just using the power of magnetism to lift up and throw heavy machines around.,,
ABNORMALITIES - SPINNING ANGLER,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,All that rotates now does so at your command. Well, as long as it’s not bigger than the Earth. You’re able to manipulate the rotation of the planet and anything smaller than that or yourself that you are currently in contact with, even when that rotation would not be physically possible normally. You can rotate someone’s waist to tear their body in half or speed up the rotation of the Earth until everyone on Earth is killed or flung into the air.,,
ABNORMALITIES - COLOUR OF BEAUTY,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You’re a painter of reality, in the most literal way. You control colour in all its shapes and forms and can use it to produce a vast variety of effects. You can change colours on anything in the world and thus give it effects based on those colours. Turning someone pink and you could remove any scariness they might’ve had, turn them blue and their entire body will become one big bruise, make them grey and they’ll become brittle and easy to break apart. You’re particularly good at changing emotions with your colours too. The possibilities are nearly endless, as is your range of effect, but you cannot outright kill with this with a single use, your colour changes do fade over time and you require colours to exist to work at all, as you cannot add colour where there is none.,,
ABNORMALITIES - UNREASOABLE TAXATION,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,By manipulating electromagnetic waves and thrusting your charged hand into the heart of another being, you can take their powers for your own. It’ll be as if you were the natural user of those powers once you’ve successfully taken them, though you’ll need to take quite some time to train them back to original force as any stolen power you take is significantly weaker than originally at first. You cannot do this on anyone too much stronger than you however as their raw power will simply rebuff your charged hand from stealing their power.,,
ABNORMALITIES - THE END,,1,,-15000,,True,,True,,The big one. The personal Abnormality of Medaka Kurokami and what has rocketed her towards greater and greater heights of power. You are now able to copy any supernatural power that you see and after a year or so of regular use even hear or read about from a second-hand description, gaining use of that power for yourself.%%%%The moment you gain the power, you will have mastered its use and even improved it to be 120% as good as its original version. You are even able to use this on mundane skills that you witness or hear about, instead of just powers. There are limits to this mighty power though. You cannot copy the raw physical statistics of people you see or hear about, such as the raw and natural physical strength or durability of someone, so it may become difficult to properly use some powers if you do not already have the required physical abilities and reactions to use it right and you cannot stop yourself from copying an ability when you see or hear about it, not with this alone at least.%%%%Taking this power however, requires you to take at least one purchase of the Cute, Magnificent and Most of All, FRESH drawback.,,
[Minuses] - [Standing Ovation],,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Those goody two shoes aren’t going to have any luck trying to see things from your view the easy way. It’s impossible for others to look into your body, mind or soul regardless of what they use. They’re not able to read your thoughts, not able to see the emotions you feel and definitely aren’t able to look through your eyes and see the world the way that you do. They’ll need to talk things out and trust that you’re giving your honest word. But what hero would ever do that for a person like you?,,
[Minuses] - [Best Bout],,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Burn fast, burn bright and then let all the lights gutter out for good. There’s no interest in prolonged battles when it comes to you, you just want it done as fast as possible. You’re able to forcibly draw out the full power of any opponent you have, making them activate their strongest form, use their best abilities and make use of all their greatest weapons or equipment. They’ll be forced to keep fighting at full pelt, even if it endangers their body, though you might find your own body being endangered if you don’t use this wisely.,,
[Minuses] - [Lonely Wedding Party],,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Friendship. Happiness. Love. Empathy. All these things the hero will say makes life worth living. But does the hero really know when he has a good thing and when he doesn’t? Maybe you can be the one to show him how false it all is, given you now have the capability to perfectly fake any kind of emotion. You can appear to be as angry or miserable or as happy as you like and no one will be able to tell the difference. You can even make yourself appear to be in true love with someone else and even some silly magical fairy won’t know you’re faking it. The only thing you can’t do is actually make yourself feel any of those emotions you appear to have. But then, that was the plan all along.,,
[Minuses] - [Octopus],,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Never has there been a man as annoying as you. Your Minus allows you to easily obstruct and stand in the way of those you face, letting you move to block or interrupt people even before they’ve made their own moves. Your arms and legs will be in position to block the blows of your foes before they’ve started moving and you’ll have the right comment ready to annoy or obstruct people even before learning what they have to say.,,
[Minuses] - [Lovely Hate],,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Who ever said bad guys don’t get rewards for good deeds? Good deeds like being the best boy, the most entertaining man around and the guy nobody wants to fuck with. In fact, one of those guys has decided to share a favourite reward with you, a certain bear of a man. You’ve unlocked a Minus that allows you to apply...certain likes and interests of yours to the world around you. The people you find yourself attracted to become a lot more permissive of certain rowdy acts and even appear to share those same certain likes and interest that you do. They’ll still be enemies or dislike you if that’s what they were already but maybe they might take the time to enjoy their victory of you in another way. If you’re into such things. The world might not change to serve you with this but it’ll definitely be more fun.,,
[Minuses] - [Fat Marker],,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Fatsy, fatso and lardass- the three verbal siblings you became used to hearing in your younger days. Trying out some loud protests of being big boned only made the jeers louder. Trying out crushing their bones under morbid amounts of fat that suddenly appeared from within them? That worked wonders. You gained the power to manipulate the levels of fat within people, increasing or decreasing anything that is seen as fat. You could remove almost all the fat from someone’s body and leave them as nothing but bulky or lean muscle and bone. Or you could crush someone’s bones and organs under the weight of their new fat assed form. Or you could just have some fun and fatten up the parts of people that you like to be thick and full. Just don’t go too overboard on yourself or you might have trouble finding shirts that fit.,,
[Minuses] - [Amateur Amazing],,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,They thought you were too freaky to touch as a child, so they decided to pelt you with abuse and rocks from afar. At first you just thought they had shit aim, when they started missing. But then you realised that even when you stood right in front of someone, they couldn’t hit you from a distance. You’ve become immune to attacks from range, impossible to hit from a distance. No matter what the attack is, it always seems to miss you, be blocked by something else, suddenly aim for something else or even just whiff entirely. The only ranged attacks that can get around this are those that don’t target you directly, such as a bomb’s explosive wave going off nearby or an attack that was targeted at someone else but you were within range.,,
[Minuses] - [Raff-Rafflesia],,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Through your hands you can now channel the power or rot and sickness. You’re able to corrode and dissolve anything that you touch or that comes near your hands. The rate of corrosion and area of effect can also be controlled by you, enough to rot away whole buildings in a few seconds at its best. You’re also able to use the corrosion to rot dirt and earth, enabling you to grow and control plants to a quite unexpectedly scary extent, including doing things like creating plant men soldiers to fight for you. You have full control over this power.,,
[Minuses] - [Five Focus],,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You’re able to turn your fingers into long red talons now, very pointy ones. You can manipulate the ailments and sicknesses of anyone you scratch with these claws, making them healthy as a horse or filling them with every disease known to man in an instant. You can even control the stage and speed of the diseases and sicknesses that you inflict onto people, as well as traits such as the infection rate or capability, toughness of the disease itself and more.,,
[Minuses] - [Friendly World],,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,The hero was right all along. You guys should be friends. Just on your terms. Those that feel hatred for you will soon wish they didn’t as negative feelings towards you are reversed into being positive feelings...without removing the negative feelings. The more someone dislikes you, the more they can’t help but like you. When someone truly hates you, they find themselves truly loving you at the same time. If you do nothing, they’ll likely become violently obsessed with you but giving them attention while they fall into this love-hate madness can allow you to shape them quite easily, twisting their hate towards those that would opposed the one they love. But maybe you might just break them instead, leaving them a mad wreck that only knows love for you and hatred for themselves.,,
[Minuses] - [Ice Fire],,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You’ve gained the power to manipulate temperatures in and around your body to quite crazy extremes, freely forming and controlling ice and fire in some amazing ways. You’re able to easily do basic things like freezing entire rooms solid or creating blades of fire in your hands but you can also do things like using your ice powers to keep your head cool and prevent yourself from getting angry or use fire powers to hype up all your allies and get them raring to fight. Your powers have a good range, reaching across dozens of metres with ease, and you’re also able to control wind to an extent by manipulating both heat and cold at once.,,
[Minuses] - [Scar Dead],,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Scars never disappear forever. You’re living proof. You’re able to instantly re-open any wound someone you can see has ever suffered, whether physical or even mental, and force it open as many times as you want even if that person heals once more. This power is quite indiscriminate when you want it to be, even able to open wounds and injuries suffered by objects, even if those ‘wounds’ were things like a sword being beaten into shape by a hammer while being forged. It also bypasses any defences against anything less than supernatural powers in general, not counting as an attack against defences against such things.,,
[Minuses] - [Marching Bad],,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Never let go of your friends and family. Even after they’ve passed on and it’s long since become unhealthy, cling to them forever more. You have the ability to raise and control any dead body that you touch as horrifying zombies. These undead beings are able to follow orders that you give them but do not take any initiative on their own. They do however possess all the abilities and skill that they had in life, at least while they remain in good shape. The more the body of the zombie you have raised rots away, the weaker their powers will become and the less will remain of their former skills. On the other hand, this does mean you can make a zombie out of any part  of a once living creature, even just a skull or a bony hand.,,
[Minuses] - [Bookmaker],,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,You are able to create a special object now, such as a large screw or sword or spear. This object must have a sharp point of some type because when it pierces a being by even a little, it will stick in them and bring them down to your level. Power, intelligence, skill, everything will be lowered to match you or risen to match you. They’ll become just as bad as you in everything and their hair will turn white too. The effect will wear off over time however. You can create several dozen of these objects at a time.,,
[Minuses] - [Welcome Hell],,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Everyone has something they fear, a thing that could drive them mad with terror and hate. You can make them face that fear, quite literally too. The power to create personal hells for people has become yours, enabling you to trap anyone you touch in a pocket world where they must face a personal hell created for them which is very much reality to them. It may force them to battle and defeat the person they hate the most or force them to endure through a series of horrific and ironic punishments for their past sins. Whatever the hell takes form as, it will be an immensely difficult trial of will and personal strength and endurance. If a person manages to defeat their personal hell, they will exit from the same place they were first imprisoned into that pocket world and will not be able to be sent back in until they have significantly changed as a person.,,
[Minuses] - [Grab Empty],,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,A mirage is a trick the world plays on the human eyes. All you do is make it a little bit more tangible. You have gained the ability to warp space itself on an incredible scale. You could stretch out space to turn a mile into a thousand miles or contract it to be able to hop from one side of a country to another. You could fold space over itself to hide an entire city within space itself or even create new space to form pocket dimensions for yourself to play in. Even tearing apart space to leave holes in reality and sucking your enemies out into an endless void can be achieved. Your actions upon space will remain until you choose to retract them or another being with similar powers undoes them.,,
[Minuses] - [Double Standard],,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,If you can’t be good enough on your own, maybe you can just make up with a lot more than whatever anyone else has. Surely quantity can fill the empty hole in your heart. You now have the ability to divide anything into a number of weaker and smaller parts, controlling the number of splits in whatever you touch to the point of making hundreds of splits. You can split anything you touch in this way and this may be either a harmful split, tearing things into many tiny pieces, or a harmless one, reducing the target into smaller and weaker copies of the original target. Your ability even works on immaterial things, such as people’s ambitions or loyalties to other people, provided you can touch a physical object that immaterial thing is connected to. However, especially powerful beings may be able to resist your power or even remain a threat despite being split into many smaller beings.,,
[Minuses] - [Eternal Eternal Life],,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Life just moves on, you know? You can’t expect things to stay the same forever, with people never leaving you and the world never changing. Not if you want to call yourself a healthy human being. The power to make things stay the same is in your hands now. You are able to make ever-lasting, static or permanent anything you touch or are involved with. You could make someone’s love for you never change no matter what you did or did not do, the trees you touch would never lose their leaves nor grow old, a water droplet that floated in the air would remain so for as long as you wished and those you turned your wrath on would remain injured forever by daring to rouse you. So long as you can make physical contact with the target or something physical the target is connected primarily to, you can make all or part of it permanent and never changing.,,
[Minuses] - [Ouroborous Connect],,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,A Minus embodies the negativity of the world. Perhaps then the greatest Minus ability would be one that took hold of the greatest causes of negativity in this world. The power to control calamities and disasters is now yours. You are able to both create and take control of any kind of great disaster that has befallen the Earth or humanity or that might befall them in the future. You could call down meteors of all different sizes, summon up any number of hurricanes or earthquakes or eruptions, create massive spikes of radiation that soak into the dirt and water around you or bring to life the most virulent plagues of the past. Perhaps by looking to the future, you could create an invasion of rebellious robots or hostile alien life forms or even create a shining star above the world that is about to enter into a supernova.,,
[Minuses] - [Real Eater],,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,The most powerful Minus and perhaps the most powerful Abnormality short of the array held by Najimi Ajimu herself...is not quite what you have taken hold of here. The Real Eater you have here is more like a...chibi version of the demon head ability eater that Hansode has. The power of Real Eater allows you to transmute your head into a large demon head. When you bite down on other beings with that head, or yourself with some contortions of the body, you gain the ability to alter any powers they have. The difference between your power and Hansode’s is that you do not possess truly freeform ability alteration. Instead, you work with the component parts and traits of any power you have access to and any power your target has access to, letting you freely combine powers or individual traits from powers to create new abilities, create upgraded versions of existing powers or add flaws to powers that had none. Combine a weak power with a very strong one to increase the raw power of the former ability, combine a power with many flaws with another that has no flaws to remove the drawbacks of an ability, even alter the look or source of power of an ability by combining it with an appropriate partner. You can combine traits from multiple sources at once, the only limitation being that you or your target currently possesses an ability with that trait in it. Do note however that what you use as your components will be used up to create the new mix. Changing two powers to create something new will give you the new power at the cost of what you used to make it.,,
[Minuses] - [Encounter],,1,,-10000,,True,,True,,Unless you desires it, no one will ever touch you again. You are able to push away everything from yourself that might harm you, whether it be physical or mental or emotional and direct that harm onto someone or something else that you can see at the time. You can direct it towards other people, towards objects or even just into the space around you to harmlessly dissipate. This defence cannot be bypassed by an attack, no matter how many attacks or how fast or how strong but it does have a certain weakness. Attacks that have no specific targets and simply work on everything without distinction within a certain area will entirely ignore your defence. Powers like Scar Dead below are just such examples. Until your chain is over, you will also not be able to push away your own death.,,
[Minuses] - [All Fiction],,1,,-14000,,True,,True,,Before you, all of creation becomes mere fiction, wished away with a thought. You are able to erase anything you desire from existence, from a person to the stars in the sky to a colour to someone’s powers to the love between two lovers to someone’s death or even more abstract things. With just a thought, these things disappear entirely. It is not impossible for beings of sufficient power or with similar beings to resist or counter your effects however, nor is it impossible for people to bring back what you have erased, though one would need to be especially mighty in comparison to you to do so. You could even use this ability to erase your own death, by setting it up in advance or doing it from the afterlife, though do remember that those who shut down your power or have some way to stop you coming back will stop you from doing this. For an extra 200CP, you may also gain Non-Fiction that expands your power to be able to erase the erasure of things, allowing you to bring back things you or others have removed from existence, an ability you lacked with just the basic ability.,,Taken at second tier
Not Equals - Dead Lock,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Why let something as silly as age ruin all the fun? You’ll never need fear the pains and aches of Father Time again as you no longer age. You’re immortal in the sense of the time that you experiencing, never again needing to fear old age. You can still continue to grow if you wish but you’ll never reach a point where you begin to weaken and eventually die from time.,,
Not Equals - Crystal Edge,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,People just hate what they know they'll never be able to match. It's not your fault you're so utterly amazing that they burn with jealousy. Or maybe it is, given what you can do with this power. You are able to mentally flick a switch that makes you despised by everyone around you. You'll instantly become the centre of attention, all of it negative. It's enough to make people drop out of battles they are currently in to try and come after you, so long as such a thing won't immediately kill them to do.,,
Not Equals - Ladies and Gentelmen,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The people demand to be served and when it comes to serving fans, you know exactly what to do to keep them happy. With just a touch, you are able to alter any other being in a very specific pair of ways. First, you are able to switch their gender between being male or female at will and second, you are able to make them a much more attractive version of themselves or stay the same during this switch. Using this, you can turn an ugly brute into a beautiful young girl or just into a female version of what he already was. There is no drop or lessening of their abilities because of these changes.,,
Not Equals - Ad Hoc Attack,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,What goes around, always comes back around. What goes up must come down. When you hit something, they'll always find themselves coming back for a second blow. Any attack that you make against someone is repeated against them a second later, whether it be a punch or a spell or a use of your powers. This secondary attack costs nothing from you but will only target the same place as the initial attack and be the same in every way as that attack.,,
Not Equals - Hyper Wit Dash,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Technically, there's not meant to be a benefit to acting cool in a fight. Being realistic, it's always more effective to just keep efficient and not show off. But we're in a manga, not real life. The more cool and over dramatic you act? The stronger you get. When you're in a fight and purposefully show off, act cool or get over dramatic, you'll find yourself steadily powering up more and more. The power up will leave you once the fight ends though, even if you manage a super cool climactic finisher move with an awesome one liner to send off your opponent.,,
Not Equals - Eccentric Talk,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It's so not cool to run out of bullets in the middle of a firefight. Dramatic? Sure, at the right time, but it is hella not fun to find yourself in that situation. Seems like you needn't worry from now on as any weapon you have just doesn't run out of ammunition. Whether it uses bullets or energy or something weird like rocks or rubbish, it looks like firing that stuff out doesn't actually get rid of it from within the weapon itself. Emptying the gun wouldn't let you take out as much ammo as you want, it only works when you're actually using it in the weapon.,,
Not Equals - Gun Visable Cover,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,They'll never expect such a childish gesture to be so dangerous. You've got finger guns now, letting you make a gun shape with your fingers and then have that hand fire off invisible bullets of force at the enemy. Each bullet is about as strong as one of your own punches but you're not limited to just firing invisible pistols. So long as you can roughly mime the use of the sort of gun, you're able to use that instead. You can cock and fire an unseen shotgun or ready up an entire chain gun, though you are limited to real world guns in this way.,,
Not Equals - Lip Service,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,With naught but a kiss, you’re able to change someone’s life. You can give a person an ability you possess just by kissing them and, if they agree, even take an ability of theirs in exchange for what you gave them. You can take what you gave back with another kiss, though you can only take back what you gave and if what you gave was lost or modified, it will be lost to you. Through this method anyway. Besides, who doesn’t like an excuse to kiss anyway?,,
Not Equals - Mirror Juvinile,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It’s awfully embarrassing to just show your true self to other people that you don’t even know. Now you don’t need to worry as you are in complete control of how other people perceive you. You are able to appear as whatever you want to other people to their five senses or even to not appear at all. You just need for them to be in sensory range for it to affect them.,,
Not Equals - Skillful,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,The Skill to be better at Skills, fitting that you of all people should have it. This ability does not provide you with anything on its own, only working when used in concert with other supernatural abilities. Having this allows you to effortlessly master any supernatural ability that you are capable of using, taking vast leaps in skill and experience with every individual use of your power. You'll discover every trick, hidden use, weakness and combination possible with your power as your growth and learning with it skyrockets to light speed.,,
Not Equals - Most Love,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,They should be glad to take on your pain, really. If they love you so much, it's only fair that they're willing to shoulder some of your burdens. You're able to transfer damage or negative effects from yourself to someone who would be considered one of your loved ones, such as a family member or friend who genuinely cares for you. They'll take the wound and it'll disappear from your body, though you are only able to transfer bad stuff from yourself after it has happened to you. If you die in a single blow, this won't help you.,,
Not Equals - Metamor Stair,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Evolution is a wonderful process. It made these humans that are so fun to mess with, didn't it? But sometimes you can't be bothered waiting a few millions years for something to happen and just want it now. Now you can with just a touch, force anything, be it a person or an object, to evolve to a new and better stage up to twice. A monkey could be made to become a man and then into an evolved form of man. A blade could be turned into a chain sword and then into an energy sword.,,
Not Equals - More Than Group,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,A one on one battle is by far the more suitable for a clear main antagonist like yourself. It's much less satisfying if the hero just beats you down with a hundred other guys as well, so now you can make it a heckuva lot harder for him to manage that. The more foes you face at once, the greater your power grows. While just a single opponent won't change anything, each additional foe beyond that will provide a significant increase to your base power, like you were half again as strong as before. There's no upper limit, so long as these multiple foes are all currently and directly engaging you personally in a battle. Just being in a war won't do anything but taking on an entire army at once will.,,
Not Equals - Auto Fumble,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The very essence of being a Not Equal is just that, being unequal to all those around you. You just don't make mistakes, never willingly or unwillingly messing up or making an error. No matter what you do, you do so at the best of your ability as if you were working in the best possible conditions with as much time as you like to make your decisions and with as little detractions as possible, save for those actively imposed by an enemy. This does not guarantee success and will not make the impossible possible, only that you do everything at your absolute best condition, time and place.%%%%For example, you would always cast a spell at your full power and with a full incantation, even if you were in an area that weakened your magic and did not have the time to do an incantation, though a place that entirely sealed your magic would not be bypassable. The resistance of an enemy, such as someone trying to dodge your attacks, can still cause you to fail.,,
Not Equals - Humor Contrast,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Never accept that someone can outmatch you forever, not when you are what you are. While being unequal to someone else might sound fitting to them because of what you are, you're just not the sort to accept that. When you find yourself facing someone that is stronger than you in a fight, you'll also find that your level of power begins to steadily rise to match theirs. This increase is permanent and the rate is quite fast, though it does not scale up as your opponents get stronger. The stronger your opponent is in comparison to you, the faster you will grow but this increase gets less and less the stronger your foe is.,,
Not Equals - My Inflation,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,If the enemy wants to start off without fighting at full power, it's not your fault if you cheat a bit in return to keep up once they release huh? You're only keeping the fight even. Whenever you are in a fight with an enemy and that foe powers up from the power level they started the fight on, you'll gain an equal increase in power while in the fight. You won't increase to match their starting level of power, so this won't be much use on those that can't transform or improve themselves, but any other sort of boost, you'll get it as well as long as they do.,,
Not Equals - Alibi Lock,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,With a wink and a smile, you’re off to another land. Which land? Any land you want. You’ve got the ability to appear anywhere you want in an instant, even locations that aren’t normally considered to be such. You can make yourself blink into existence within a magically sealed vault, in another dimension or even within someone’s mind or heart, where you can communicate directly to them or really mess them up. There’s nothing that can keep you out short of directly disabling or blocking this power.,,
Not Equals - Initialize History,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Retcons are a common staple of the comic book industry. Most fans don't have much fondness for them but you've found they have their uses, now that you're able to retcon living people. You are able to alter the history of anyone you touch, changing what happened in their past and drastically altering them as a person and, potentially, even altering other people.%%%%The greater the changes you make, the more people those changes might affect, the more powerful your target or those affected by your changes and the more important to the overall story your target and others affected are, the more tiring this process will be and too great changes for your current level of power will be beyond you entirely.%%%%You could certainly change the histories of entire families of normal people without much relation to this world's story, even to the point of them developing their own reasonably strong Abnormalities if they had the potential, but you could not touch a close companion of your own and make it so they have already defeated all of your enemies in this world for you. While as you grow in power, the changes you can make will grow, you cannot make entirely impossible changes to the past become real, no matter your power. Not through this ability in any case.,,
Not Equals - Life Zero,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Skills came about from your glorious leader, why would you ever let them be turned against their creator? You've got the power to shut down other powers, nullifying any supernatural ability that you can see and preventing those that possess such abilities from using them while under your gaze. You can selectively allow certain people or even certain abilities to still work but to those you do not allow, none may continue to operate when seen by you. Of course, you need to be watching them to do this and even blinking will momentarily lift the block, so make sure to keep your eyes on the prize here.,,
Not Equals - Lost Password,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,When the fools try to crawl their way up to your level, you'll be waiting at the top with a hammer to slam down on their hands and send them plummeting back to the distant ground. On contact, you are able to deeply and permanently weaken any being that you touch. You are effectively able to 'return them to level one'. This removes anything that they do not naturally have or that is not the basic knowledge and common sense that an average adult of their race would have. They'd lose all their training in combat, all the skill in using supernatural powers, lose any powers or abilities that they did not innately possess, have the raw power that they have reduced to what they had at the very beginning. They retain their memories and can still function but will in effect, be a level one character compared to whatever they were before.,,
Not Equals - Skill Creation,,1,,-10000,,False,,True,,For someone who already has so many powers, one might come to think they’d not need any more. But never underestimate the allure of new toys to play with or how happy others are when you share them. Skill Creation is an Abnormality that gives you the power to create powers, within certain limits. The powers you are able to create are outlined by the powers you already have available to you. You are able to use any ability or trait that you have, whether it be a superpower or a magic spell or a personality trait or some physical trait, and use any of the component parts to create your new powers. This way, you can grant copies of your own powers to others, create hybrids of your existing powers for yourself to use or make weaker versions of your powers before granting them to others. You can make as many copies of any power you can create as you desire, it costs nothing and takes nothing more than a thought from you, though having multiples of the same power will not allow you to use more than the effects of one at a time. When it comes to handing powers out to others, you may do so instantly provided you can see all your desired targets presently. This Abnormality also allows you to retake what you have given out even if you cannot see the recipient at the time.,,
Not Equals - Free Climbing,,1,,-12000,,False,,True,,You're already used to the numbers game, given the sorts of power you regularly use and interact with. This just made you take it to a literal level. You are capable of manipulating parameters and variables to become greater and stronger or lesser and weaker. You can increase someone's physical strength or decrease their intelligence, increase their age or decrease their hair follicle count. So long as you can put a hard number to it, you are able to raise or lower that number. You are limited in how much of either can be done, only able to raise up to one thousand the original number or decrease to one thousandth of the original number. You must come in physical contact with your target to use this ability on it.,,
Styles - Provocations User,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It’ll definitely be a pain to fight you. With just a word, you can ruin anyone’s composure and force them to act out in anger. No matter how strong they are or how well controlled they are or even how many times you’ve used this, you’ll make someone get spitting mad for a few seconds whenever you specifically try to provoke them.,,
Styles - Four Colour User,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,A lifetime of collecting comics has paid off well. By making comic book sound effects with your voice, you are able to empower the connected actions by a fair margin. Yelling out POW as you punch someone would see them hit with significantly more force while exclaiming BZZZT as you electrocuted them would make them get rocked by half again as many volts as before.,,
Styles - Royal User,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,An Anti-Style Style for sure and maybe also reflecting of an arrogant tone as well. When you speak, you are able to prevent anyone else around you from being able to speak while you are vocalising. Even those that speak through means other than vocal chords, such as over electronic devices or through telepathy, will be silenced when within range of your voice.,,
Styles - Truth User,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Not all Styles must be directed towards violent ends. The Truth User Style brings to the forefront the aspect of Styles that focuses on communication and understanding between beings. When you speak with someone or a group of people, you allow all those participating in the talk with you to come to truly understand one another. The emotions behind the words you and they speak become clear as day to each of you, as do the reasons they have for speaking as they do and whether or not they tell the truth, lie or merely omit information from their words.,,
Styles - Pleasantry User,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The power of please and thank you is not to be underestimated. You find that your life and the lives of those around you truly do become easier so long as you remain verbally courteous. Not only do you find yourself much luckier by never breaking a courteous mode of speech towards others, as well as speaking up when it would be required for politeness sake, but you also find more specific effects benefiting you as well. Saying please when you ask someone for something will make them genuinely consider your request, even if they despised you. Saying a short thanks before a meal will greatly improve the taste and nutritional value of the meal. Offering the first move in a match towards your opponent will allow your own first attack to come out faster and stronger than usual. These effects will not make a huge difference on their own but the sheer number of them should make up for it.,,
Styles - Cruelty User,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,A nasty guy like you probably shouldn’t get rewarded for being so mean but the world has never been a fair place. When you taunt and insult and act rudely towards an opponent, you’ll be able to empower yourself and become more and more monstrous the worse your opponent views your words. The ruder your speech seems to them, the stronger you’ll become. Throwing out your best swear words against a tough sailor probably won’t see more than a slight thickening of your skin but against a real prude who’s been raised in a sheltered home to always respect others...well, don’t be surprised if you can start knocking buildings down by brushing past them with your enormous body.,,
Styles - Chatterbox User,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Nothing can stop this motor mouth from getting her words in. You’ve become able to degrade the wills of those around you and make them more submissive by talking louder and faster than anyone else. So long as you’re talking over everyone and fast enough that they can’t get a word in, they’ll find that their wills start to quickly get sapped away until they’re left as almost mindless drones that can be easily directed. The heroic types can hold out pretty well against this, so you’ll be more likely to find that this just makes it very hard for them to concentrate unless you have a way to keep them still and listening to your mindless chatter.,,
Styles - Objection Style,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Being contrarian and confrontational is in your very words by now. By yelling out “OBJECTION!” you are able to instantly put a stop to any one action that your opponent in any single fight has taken. You could prevent them from launching an attack or negate an attack that has already been fired, prevent them from blocking or dodging one move of your own or some other single event that can be undone. Only one such command may be used in each separate battle but used wisely, it can bring the fight to a victory for you instantly.,,
Styles - Jinx User,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,It may be just a silly old word game to some but you can turn the Jinx into something quite frightening. If you ever manage to predict what someone says and manage to say it at the same time as them, you are able to place them under the Jinx curse, which then allows you to give them one order that they cannot refuse or ignore. This order cannot cause them to bring serious harm to themselves directly, such as asking them to kill themselves or allow you to kill them, but it can put them in serious danger, like having them fight their allies, or ruin their lives, such as commanding them to run naked into the street and defecate in public view. Any command will only last for a few minutes before they are freed from the curse but nothing stops you from managing to lay the curse on them once more. Aside from them just not speaking.,,
Styles - Label User,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Just taking the foe out of the fight for a while can sometimes be all you need. You’re able to seal up to five people at once into cards you summon out of nowhere, so long as you can get those people to reply to you. Those sealed within the cards are out of range of any powers and cannot be affected by such but will eventually break out on their own, with stronger people breaking out sooner, and destroying the cards will always release all those trapped instantly.,,
Styles - Folktale User,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,This mythical Style enables you to enact ritualistic punishments or effects on people by reciting folk stories, old wives tales and bad rumours. From things as minor as cursing someone so that masturbating often makes them go blind to things like stealing food from others resulting in someone being attacked by gigantic hungry bears or making those who go off alone into the wilds be beset by many wolves or perhaps even cursing someone that is very vain and overestimating of themselves to be forced to deal with many trials that will test their ability to humble themselves, such as being presented with ‘magical’ clothes that are invisible to the idiotic observer. While what you can accomplish with this Style is mostly limited only by the amount of research you put into older tales, you are unable to enact any effect that would not be primarily a punishment for another being, the summoned folktales will fade away quickly after carrying out their curse on the enemy and no curse will result in the instant, unstoppable death of the target.,,
Styles - Testament User,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,When you’re just that salty, you might as well doom the entire planet after failing. Testament is a simple Style, perhaps inspired after a bit too much cartoon watching. When activated, it drops any orbiting moons around the current planet you are on towards the planet itself. You’ll be mostly assured of this cruel world’s destruction, unless someone literally destroys everything you’ve dropped towards the world. You can also set for this to activate automatically on your death. Just to be sure, you know?,,
Styles - Stutter User,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,A Style doesn’t really need you to speak perfectly clearly to use. Why, the Stutter User Style you’ve taken a hold of only makes that all too clear. By stuttering out your words, you are able to create and control vibrations through your voice. These range from immensely powerful vibrations that effectively act as earthquakes able to cause destruction over vast distances to ones fine enough to give someone a massage while they stand next to you. Your control is a bit rough at first but over time, you’ll be able to control the vibrations to the point of telekinesis, letting you move objects with your voice, or heat things until they melt with hyper fast vibrations. Even stranger and more impressive results may be possible provided you spend the time to master them.,,
Styles - Nursery Rhyme User,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,By singing a nursery rhyme, you are able to decrease the age of any that hear that nursery rhyme. They’ll get younger and younger as you keep singing, not just becoming younger in body but also gaining the clothes, items and powers that they had at those ages, even if that would remove things from them. All they keep is their minds as their age rapidly, geometrically decreases. The louder you sing, the bigger the affected area that your song will reach. Your power cannot reduce someone to being younger than an infant but it can de-age someone from death, even if they didn’t die of old age, and bring them back to life. It can even work over transmitters such as cell phones or speakers to extend your range further. The only way to disable the effect is to knock you out, at which point everyone will return to normal.,,
Styles - Homo User,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,A homophone is a pair of words that sound the same as each other when spoken verbally but have different meanings. To you, the meanings may not be so different, as you are able to swap things or actions with their homophones. You could turn the hairs on someone’s head into hares that hop away to their burrows. You could make someone being teased now be covered in teas. A noble sire, a ruler and leader, could be made into a despondent sigher, depressed and lost in themselves. A town that has been razed to the ground could be raised back to what it once was. And what you could do to a bunch of seamen is perhaps best left only hinted at. You are able to use any real world language, that you have not made and as it was originally here without any additions through your influence, as a basis for Homo User.,,
Styles - Big Little User,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Through the act of shouting or whispering, you are able to increase or decrease the scale of your actions. By describing what you are doing in a great shout, such as yelling about how well you are hurting someone in a fight, you’ll find that the effects of your actions are amplified up to five times over depending on how loud you are. Similarly, you are able to minimize the effects of anything by describing it in a whisper as it happens or is about to happen, reducing it to just a fifth of its’ normal level of effect when talking at your quietest. As long as you can pay attention and keep talking, you can reduce the power of your opponents’,,
Styles - Russian User,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Time is a matter of perspective. As is cause and effect. And most things really. You’ve learnt to play havoc with that perspective, twisting things around to have a little bit more fun. You are able to reverse actions and situations between two individuals that you can see, including yourself. By announcing that the situation is different because you are ‘In Soviet Russia...” you are able to swap the positions or status of two people. You could cause the wounds one person has dealt to another to be reflected back to them with the original victim healed even from death. Someone who has been captured or imprisoned by another person is suddenly the captor themselves. A villain who has stolen the power of a hero now finds the hero holds all the power of both parties.,,
Styles - Answer User,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,Are you just talking to yourself or is something strange going on? Through this Style, you are able to find out the answer to any question. You need only vocalise your question and you’ll find that your voice then takes on a life of its’ own to talk about the answer. Answers to questions are highly specific and will likely require multiple questions to find out the right questions to ask and to get further detail on the answers you have already gained. You are also unable to find out answers that lie solely outside of the jump you currently inhabit.,,
Styles - Metonymy User,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,By replacing your concept of ‘oneself’ with the concept of another being entirely, you are able to take on the form of that being, including any abilities that they may have, for a short period of time before you revert to your original self. You cannot transform into someone you are not very personally familiar with however, nor into someone who possesses far more power than you.,,
Styles - Eight Hundered Lies User,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,Alone? Who’s alone? You already brought an army of yourself to fight with you. You can split yourself into 800 individual, fully real clones that are every bit the same as you. Each of those clones can then split into 800 more clones for a total of 640,000 versions of you. So long as even a single clone lives, so will you, as you are simultaneously every one of these clones as well as being your original self. Don’t think too hard on it. These clones can be summoned in an instant and can quickly replace any lost clones, so long as you’re still able to speak.,,
Styles - Contradictery Conjunction User,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Every day, miracles are happening around the world. From child birth to heroic feats of courage and strength, the everyday impossible is always happening. But you’re not about what’s just every day. You make the really miraculous things happen. When you use this style, usually by reciting the word ‘therefore’, you are able to make the least possible thing in the current situation the most possible thing. A girl cutting an airship in half or winning against an opponent they could not ordinarily defeat at all. It’s a mighty ability that, with careful use, can allow you to succeed in almost all things. But it cannot make the impossible possible and it will only ever make the least likely thing into the most likely, which may not always be exactly what you want to happen.,,
Styles - Fact User,,1,,-12000,,False,,True,,Did you know that you fortune cookies are from China? Honest truth. Did you also know that when you tell a lie now, it becomes the truth? I promise I’m not lying. You have the ability to turn any lie you tell into the truth, changing reality to match your words. All you need to do is have someone other than yourself there and to tell them a statement that begins with ”Did you know...”. As long as that person believes, even for the briefest of moments, that you have not lied then the lie you told becomes the truth. If they can manage to prove that you were lying or have some ability that allows them to uncover lies, reveal truth or destroy illusions, then they can revert your lies and any effects they have had on the world and the beings in it. However, if they cannot do that, then they are essentially helpless before your tricks.,,
Costume Set,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,An unlimited supply of aprons and jeans. They’re all very comfy and seem to fit on people no matter their size or shape. Somewhat strangely, the aprons are only wearable by those with no other clothing on them at the time, though the aprons also provide warmth and a small degree of protection to the whole body if worn. The jeans are similar, only differing in that the wearer cannot be wearing anything but the jeans.,,
Musical Style,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,A musical instrument of your choice. It’s a high-end model, whatever it is, and very sturdy too. What makes it special is that anyone playing the instrument can perfectly translate the emotions they feel into the music the instrument makes if they desire, with the quality of the music rising alongside the depth and breadth of the emotions being channelled into the instrument. The audience will be able to almost tangibly feel the hopes and dreams that go into your music if you feel strongly enough.,,
Special - Snow White,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A closet full of white clothes, various styles of jump suits and other fully covering outfits that adjust to fit the wearer automatically. These special clothes are quite heavy, as they are made from a very special kind of thread able to hold several tonnes of material on a single strand. The outfits are impressively resistant to temperature extremes and blunt force impacts, you could stand in front of a few grenades and survive in not too bad shape if you covered your face with your sleeves. Sadly, the threads add up to a hefty weight and you may find yourself slowed if you’re not too far beyond the normal level of human strength.,,
Special - Phantom Babel,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The school has been around for quite a while now and undergone more than a few revisions. The old school buildings are rather massive affairs, dotted around the campus and usually cordoned off. It seems you’ve got one of your own though, gifted to you by the administration. This ten storey tall mish-mash of buildings is quite large and filled with countless entertainment systems, hobby tools, creature comforts and other objects to make it into the perfect den for a bored student like yourself. You’ll find a similar structure existing in future worlds at your school or workplace of the time or you can combine it, just once, into your warehouse or existing property.,,
Special - Jump Club,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,You’ve been given permission to start your very own club in the school system and it seems like it’s become an ultra-popular club too. You can have your club focus around any mundane skill, task or concept that you like and you’ll find that the club attracts both people good at that thing to a superhuman degree and also notable people from around the school. You might not tempt any of the student council into joining but don’t be surprised if a blue haired midget or green haired sneak spend some time in your clubroom. You’ll find that you are the head of this club even in future schools or businesses, where it will draw various notable people in the school or organisation to become part of it. You’ll be well respected and liked as the head, so long as you don’t screw up too bad.,,
Special - Board of Justice,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Is a simple club not enough for you then? Perhaps a disciplinary committee of your own might make up for it. Noting the relative inefficiency of the existing committee, the school board has put you in charge of a bunch of students with orders to do as you see fit to correct school order, however you see the school order as being. As the undisputed leader, the students are extremely loyal and obedient towards you even when it puts their lives at danger or makes them go against the school administration. They’re also all Abnormals of no small might. While none are close to equalling titans like Medaka or Kumagawa, they’d each be a notable member of Class 13 if they weren’t placed under your command. In future worlds, you’ll be in charge of a similar group in future worlds, attracting similarly powerful people in each world, though they’ll be suited to the world you find yourself in instead of being Abnormals.,,
ABNORMAL - BOMB BALLS,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Pockets full of trouble, you’ve got. You hold in your hands a variety of coloured balls and small square shaped explosives. These are the usual weapons of one Myouri Unzen, a special sort of weapon normally usable by only those with the right Abnormality. You might not use them as well but they remain very handy weapons. The coloured balls are very bouncy, except when impacting flesh when they then become as hard as steel. The square shaped explosives are as powerful as a modern fragmentation grenade and almost undetectable as explosives. You get a pocketful of each every week.,,
ABNORMAL - PSYCHO MASK,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A pale white mask in a design of your choice, perfectly fitted to your face. This specialised mask works to filter the air you take in, like an advanced gas mask that never needs replacement, while also focusing any mental powers that you possess. It’s not going to multiply their power too much but you’ll definitely see a fair boost in effectiveness and range when you are wearing the mask as opposed to when you are not.,,
ABNORMAL - DESCENT INTO THE MAZE,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Beneath a property that you own, or beneath your warehouse, is now a massive facility, numbering in at least a dozen floors and filled with the most advanced scientific equipment that this world has to offer. The door to this facility is only open able to those with superhuman strength that exceeds any construction vehicle or those with the luck of a powerful Abnormal. The facility is staffed with many loyal and intelligent researchers, along with a basic but experienced guard roster, but there are no Abnormals present aside from yourself.,,
ABNORMAL - THE EMPIRE,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The name of your family is one that resounds across Japan and the rest of the world too. The Jumper Group is one of the greatest family-run conglomerations, a vast international empire that has only recently emerged onto the stage of world business and politics. Your parents are the ones in charge right now but eventually you’ll be placed into positions of greater and greater authority, provided you desire to of course. The company rakes in enough riches to equal an entire country and has similar political pull, if not more in your homeland. The family home is a sight to see as well, with a front garden as big as some whole school districts and a house almost the same size, along with a surrounding township that is also owned for all the servants. Eventually you’ll inherit but for now, just be pleased with being the richest young heir in the world.,,
[Minus] - [Black Ogre],,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,The Minus always need to have their own, opposing version of what the Abnormals get. At least they look cool doing it. Black Ogre is similar to Snow White in its’ suitability as a ward against heat and cold but where Snow White is made of material that excels against defending against blunt force trauma, Black Ogre is made of a different thread that is best suited for defending against sharp attacks. Blades or fragments from an explosion work best but raw physical force is something it performs poorly against. On the upside, it’s easy to pull off some incredible acrobatics in the outfit. If only one could combine the two. You’ve got a closet full of these outfits, which will resize to fit any wearer.,,
[Minus] - [Screw Me],,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Think of this as a signature item of sorts. A calling card of an object that you can summon at a will. Just with a thought, you are able to summon a specific sort of object to your hands. It’s got to be a simple and mundane object. A giant screw or nail for example or perhaps a sword or hammer. The object can change in size to an extent, to being as small as one of your fingers or as large as your arm. It can even change shape to a small extent. There’s no limit to how many of this item you can summon, though you can only make a hundred or two at max each second. You can buy this item multiple times to pick other objects. It is also possible to channel your powers through these objects.,,
[Minus] - [Normalise Solution MK. 2],,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A very special fluid, much advanced from the initial creation that Youka Naze made. The Normalize Solution MK 2 is a special fluid that can disable the supernatural powers and traits of any being that takes the substance inside their body for several minutes, no matter how great those powers were. After those minutes are up, the powers will come right back though. You’ve got a special, very tough injector that can pierce metal with ease along with 5 vials of the Normalise Solution. You’ll get replacements for any used vials a month after they were used.,,
[Minus] - [Waiting Room],,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Looks like you’ve got a benefactor looking out for you. Not that one! A much cuter, younger and more charming one. Or so she says. If you happen to die during a jump, you’ll find yourself waking up in an empty classroom that has a young student that asks to be called Anshin’in at the front. She’s very nice, taking time to talk with you about what happened to cause your death and how you could have fixed it. She might even give you a little present, a power or item to be used to help you out a bit when she sends you back to life. It won’t let you win with ease but it might give you a chance where you had none. Sadly, she only opens her doors once a jump and attempts to do more than talk with her, at least attempts she’s not encouraging, will just see you booted out.,,
Not Equal - Sweet Sweets,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Careful you don’t overload that sweet tooth of yours. You’ve got an unlimited amount of candy now, just about any sort you can possibly find on a normal Earth in as great a quantity as you can fit down your mouth with each gulp. You can even share it with others if you’re actually feeling nice for once in your life.,,
Not Equal - New Wheels,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,It’s every young teenagers dream to have their own car and while your new ride might not be some flashy sports car, this small truck is just about the toughest thing in the world. It’s pretty fast and spacious, enough to hold half a dozen teens like yourself with plenty of room to spare, but its best use is violently ramming it into your enemies. The impact will always knock away anything not significantly larger than the truck, regardless of the targets strength or mass, though it won’t necessarily damage them. The truck won’t be damaged though and only the strongest guys in this world will be able to actually harm it.,,
Not Equal - Jumpanui Village,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,It might seem like it’s a little out of time and place but you should just chalk it up to the innate weirdness of this place. This village contains several hundred of your own descendants, all still retaining many of your own visual features. It seems like you cultivated this town in order to have a ready supply of loyal agents for any plans you or an ally might have. They’re your genuine biological descendants, having kept their lineages pure and undiluted in some freaky way you don’t wanna ask about, and are all excellent spies, agents and warriors. They’re well aware of how to use any abilities you might have passed down to them but have no special powers beyond that. They do see you as an unquestionable lord and master of the town however, taking any order you care to give with relish.,,
Not Equal - Flask Plan Data,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The jewel of Hakoniwa Academy or at least what they hope will one day be that jewel. This USB contains all the data so far accumulated by the Flask Plan and a fair bit more on top. A project created in order to one day turn Normals into Abnormals, these are the starting steps towards successfully completing that plan. Given the creators of the plan’s true origins, there’d be no hope of succeeding at all without having this in hand and yet even with it, you’re still in for an arduous road of study, experimentation and a lot of expended resources. But when you’ve managed to bottle the essence of Gods, it’ll all be worth it.,,
Stylist - Hello Nurse,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,It might be a touch skimpy, in that you might get arrested for wearing it, but this nurse outfit seems to have quite the effect on those who see it. It’s not all that tough like some of the other clothing on offer here but what it does do almost without fail is both arouse the attention of those who see you in it and get all but the most wary of warriors to lower their guards. Add on your own charms and it shouldn’t be hard to talk your way into a guarded fortress or, of course, into the bed of your preferred lover.,,
Stylist - Jet Fighter,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A highly advanced new jet made by the hands of the genius Maguro Kurokami himself. You’ve borrowed one of the few working models and is it ever a beauty. Faster and sturdier then even the most advanced modern day jet, outfitted with a range of armaments that allow it to serve as an anti- ground, anti-bunker or even dogfighter. It’s also able to, somehow, fit in half a dozen people into the back seat without interrupting the pilot at all, though it might be a bit of a squeeze. You’ll find it refuels on its own if you leave it alone for a while.,,
Stylist - Black,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Pretty sure a civilian shouldn’t be having this sort of vehicle. You’ve got your own aircraft carrier ship, fully outfitted with crew and jet fighters and bombers and all the good stuff. It’s fully coloured to your liking, whether you prefer a single colour or to have some sort image or styling all across the ship. You’ve got a full complement of soldiers and pilots, all some of the best in the world, to pilot your fighters and guard the ship, along with the permission to go into any waters in the world that you wish so long as you’re not actually hostile to anyone you’re sailing towards. The ship won’t ever need refuelling either and the ration stores seem to always be enough for you and the rest of the crew.,,
Stylist - Style Book,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Now this is something unique. Styles are a power used through language but so far, it has only been through spoken words or, rarely, non-verbal but still bodily communication. The book you hold in your hands can change all of that. This Style Book allows the use of Styles and other powers or actions through the written word. By focusing on a Style that you know and writing out what you would normally say, you are now able to use it on any who read those words. You can even do this with other powers you have or other actions. By writing in the single power you would use or short action you would take, and expending any energy or other costs you’d need to normally expend, you can seal in that particular power use or action for later activation. Then so long as you can see the page, you’re able to activate it at will with a word and unleash what was stored. A spell to create several flying blades could unleash that metal torrent from its pages from a distance or a sealed in punch could send a phantom fist flying into the face of the one holding the page. You can remove pages from the book and it will never run out of pages either nor weigh more because of it.,,
Transfer,,3,,00,,False,,False,,In case you wanted one of your companions to feel a little bit more special, you are able to use this option to transfer CP at a 1:1 ratio to an individual companion, providing them with more points at the cost of your own.,,
Import,,3,,-500,,False,,False,,Looks like everyone is getting their own little council now. For every 50CP you spend on this option, you’ll get the ability to import one existing companion or to create a new companion in this world. They’ll gain a free origin, all associated freebies, discounts and stipends as well as 600CP to spend on what they want to in this jump from the perks, items or powers sections.,,
Canon,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,You’ve got some of the oddest people around here, just waiting for the chance to go on an adventure. If only you could convince them. Purchasing this option will give you one chance for each purchase to convince a character in this world to come along with you as a companion to other worlds. You’ll be lucky enough to hit it off with your chosen person on a good foot and continue to meet them in favourable situations at least a few times.%%%%The following options offer OC companions, premade characters that can be bought as companions. Any of the following options may be used as an import for an existing companion but be aware that it will change them to fit the description of the OC Companion, such as personality changes, if they do not already. These changes do not revert after the jump but can be changed over time or through direct means.,,
Right Hand,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,A loyal friend, someone who has known you since you were both toddlers, and who has dedicated themselves to sticking by your side so that you never get too big a head. They’re excellent at keeping you grounded in reality, whether that be morally or making sure you don’t get too inhuman or even just ensuring you don’t forget about the little details in your master plans, and they’re even willing to fight against you if they believe it’ll help you more in the long run. They’re not the most skilled but they do have an incredible amount of determination to work through pain. They are of the Special origin, with associated freebies and discounts, and gain 800CP to buy perks, powers or items with.,,
Shadow,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Not all your allies need also be your friends or even someone you know very well. The Shiranui village has assigned one of their members to act as your double, becoming a supernatural substitute for you that seeks to secretly support your efforts and all your goals. They don’t show much fondness for you outwardly, the opposite really, but their dedication to supporting you is nothing to be underestimated and they may at times take actions you’d disapprove of if they think the benefits to you are worth it. Perhaps bribing the Shadow with candy could let you get closer to them over time. At the very least it may make their biting tongue a bit less stingy. They have the Minus origin, with connected freebies and discounts, as well as 800CP to spend on perks, items and powers. They also have the Reversed perk for free, though it is locked to only work on you.,,
Subject Number One,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Some people just really like the idea of turning into a super-powered monster. Your friend here is one of them and definitely one of the more vocal ones. You met in middle school a little while ago and they quickly latched onto you, like a parasite of some kind, and they’re the sort of person you can’t help but like at least a little. They absolutely love the idea of being part of any kind of crazy experiment, especially ones to gain new powers, and really want to use those powers to then help you out. And also enjoy the use of them. When they’re not undergoing terrifying procedures that go against all that science stands for, they’re eager to get you to go out of your shell and have fun in public. They are an Abnormal origin, with the freebies and discounts of it, and have 800CP to spend on perks, items and powers. They also gain the ABNORMAL DESIRE power for free.,,
Youthful Parent,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,It is a little embarrassing to have your mom or dad constantly helping you out in a fight but no one can say they don’t care about you. This is either your mother or your father, appearing young enough to be mistaken for your sibling. They care a great deal about you, to the point of being a little overbearing, but thankfully they like the same things you do and think the path you have yourself on right now is quite the fine one, so they’ll mostly try their best to support you doing what you are doing now. At least they get along great with all your friends. They are an Abnormal origin taker, with the freebies and discounts to match, and gain 800CP to spend on perks, items and powers. They also gain Mother’s Task for free, even if it is your Dad.,,
Lovely Sibling,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Isn’t family wonderful? Your older brother or sister definitely seems to think so. In fact, they think you’re the most wonderful person that could ever possibly exist and that no one else could ever match the shining beauty you radiate. They’re a little creepy but the affection they feel for you is genuine. They’re skilled at most things they try, incredibly intelligent, truly gifted with investing money and willing to do absolutely anything to keep you happy and safe. Perhaps too much as they do have a bad habit of trying to take any problems you have onto their own shoulders, even if it hurts them to do so. They are of the Abnormal origin, gaining the freebies and discounts of that origin, and have 800CP to spend on perks, items and powers. They also gain the Analysis power for free.,,
Shoulder Buddy,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,If in all the world you could trust just one person to have your back, this little guy would be that person. They’re small and light enough to easily cling to your back without slowing you down and they’ve got a personality that, while almost the opposite of yours, is quite complementary to you. A prideful and arrogant person would gain a buddy that is soft spoken and humble yet able to communicate to you without hurting your ego, allowing them to help you avoid the pitfalls of pride. They’re an Abnormal origin, with all freebies and discounts of such, and have 800CP to spend on perks, items or powers. If you take any Powers, they also gain for free a power that supplements and combines excellently with any powers you have gained, enabling you to feel significantly greater power or less drawbacks to using your own powers when you work together.,,
Dearest Enemy,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,Your opposite number. The Kumagawa to your Medaka or the Medaka to your Kumagawa. This guy or gal is someone you’ve never quite gotten along with, appearing like a twisted mirror to your own personality and history. You can’t deny their abilities though, always managing to keep almost evenly matched with you regardless of what powers they or you actually have. Despite the tension that exists between you two, this person is always trying to push you to be better. It may be out of admiration, a crush, a belief that all beings need help, respect from past competitions or perhaps even a darker purpose, but they clearly want you to be the best you can be and will do what they can to challenge and test you until you get good. If you go off the deep end, however you see it, they’re also willing to be the one who does all they can to bring you back, though they might try and pretend it was for some unrelated reason. If you’re a Minus, they’re going to be an Abnormal and likely be motivated by more moral or altruistic reasons for why they challenge and help you. If you’re an Abnormal, they’ll be a Minus and might be assisting you the way they do out of self-hatred, a desire for a powerful opponent to defeat them or as a secret call for help themselves. A Special will find themselves opposed and assisted by a Not Equal, a person whose loose grip on reality has made them believe that you are the true Main Character of all stories and wishes to support you. A Not Equal will be helped by a Stylist, a wordsmith who believes that your delusions are only hiding a truly talented soul and wishes to help you reach your true potential. A Stylist? Who knows what they’ll get. All of these are just guidelines, rather than hard rules on who you might get. Whatever origin they take, they gain all the freebies and discounts of that origin, as well as 800CP to spend on perks, items or powers.,,
[I Won! I Won! I Won!],,4,,-1000,,False,,True,,Looks like the dark desires of Kumagawa have been forced upon you. You’ll have to wear a special kind of outfit for your entire stay in this world. If you’re a male or female, you’ll need to wear the Naked Apron set. Which is exactly as it says, being completely in the nude except for a rather small and front only apron. The other, for females only, is wearing nothing but jean pants, leaving your feet and top entirely bare. No matter how embarrassing or even illegal situations you get into, you can’t change either.,,
Kurokami Pride,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You were born into the famed Kurokami family as the youngest sibling of Maguro, Medaka and Kujira Kurokami. This overrides the age roll to make you younger than Kujira. Sadly, you don’t seem to share the exceptional nature of the others of your family just by being born into it. What you do get is a healthy dose of inadequacy that you’ll be feeling constantly throughout your ten years as your siblings excel and surpass you at anything you try to do.,,
Are You Even Alive?,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,The knowledge of being fictional can have some pretty nasty side effects. You’ve started to see everyone else around you for what they really are, just fictional characters written for someone’s enjoyment. You’ve stopped really thinking that they have any feelings or personal agency, seeing little issue in toying with them for your own purposes or goals. People aren’t people to you anymore, just tools and toys and resources.,,Retail rocker
Grand Reveal,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Don’t expect to get much face time in your decade here. Everything you do has to be backwards now. Your back must always be facing towards people you’re talking to while your face faces away from them. You’ve got to fight backwards, cook backwards and even eat backwards. It’s a hard life saving for face for a dramatic reveal at a later date but it’ll be worth it once you do. Probably.,,
Fukuru You,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,A lifetime of settling for less, a few decades of compromising with others, a life spent dull and without any true wonder to it all the way since birth. No wonder you’re so disaffected from the world around you. You’ve become mostly apathetic and inured to emotions with this, rarely able to feel more than a few sparks of emotion at most things. Now and then something can come along and ignite your feelings to an incredibly strong level, perhaps even causing you to take some dangerous or disturbing actions, and unfortunately most of the things that would cause this to happen are through negative emotions. Maybe you’ll get lucky and find someone to whom you can really feel love for. They’re a lot less lucky if you do though.,,Retail rocker
Absolute Minus,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Normally you’d be protected from much of the innate temperament that comes from being a Minus, even if you were one. Now you’ll be feeling it at the very worst. You embody the worst sort of Minus possible, being constantly miserable, filled with hate and rage at yourself and all those around you and obsessed with dragging down anyone not already like you to become like you in full. People will be able to tell exactly what kind of being you are from the vile, disgusting aura that constantly surrounds you from the sheer strength of your despicableness.,,
Blackest Wedding Ever,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,Never has there been a bride more desired than you Jumper. You’ve got your own personal Black Wedding now, a competition between many of the richest and most powerful and deadly men and women in the world to take you as their spouse. Unfortunately for you, all your suitors are quite mad and quite willing to hurt you or worse during the competition or after. Some are even willing to kill you just to deny you to their rivals. You’re going to be the centre of a big conflict between many Abnormals, Minus and even Stylists or Not-Equals and most of them aren’t going to be even a little friendly to you.,,Retail rocker
My Little Friend,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Got a cute little friend next to you there, a young boy or girl that’s small enough to be carried on your back easily. They’re very frail physically and sadly possess no real power. But they’re important to you, both emotionally because of the long history you share as their saviour and because you’re going to need to keep that kid safe for the entire time you are here, else failure will lead you to fail your chain completely. Worse yet, they’ll be dragged into the conflicts of Abnormal people of varying levels, taking you with them.,,
Blood Rain,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,The endless desire for blood rages within you, almost like an Abnormality of its own. You’ve got an almost uncontrollable need to kill and main others to terrible extents, even if they’re your allies. Even the smallest reason is enough for you to lash out with lethal force at those around you, even if they’re a dear friend or lover. Even the greatest heroes will find themselves barraged by countless, near irresistible desires to kill those around them in their day to day life. Even if you can control it, others might see you as too much of a danger to let you go free.,,Retail rocker
Loser Trash,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,A win to loss ratio of zero to a million. Is that what they’ll carve on your gravestone? You can’t remember ever having truly won anything in your life in this world. Any time you manage to pull out a win, it’s only because you bested the battle and are fated to lose the war. It’s impossible for you to truly have any personal victories but at least you are able to assist others in winning without tarnishing their efforts. You might not be able to win but others can win for you at times and you can help them win. That all depends on being clever enough to avoid having your wins matter to the team.,,
The Many Kings of Cheat,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,From the simplest of games to the most climactic of battles, you’ll never have a fair fight again. Not because you manage to get an advantage but because everyone, without fail, will manage to cheat against you. No matter how good you are, your opponents will always get a serious advantage due to their own cheating or the cheating of other people to help them out, making even simple competitions into difficult struggles for you and life or death battles into truly dangerous stuff.,,
Kujira Kind,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You got addicted to misery during your childhood. You loved the feeling of opening up your own scabs, of purposefully sabotaging yourself so that you could bask in that misfortune. Anyone could be forgiven for believing you are a Minus. You’ll have a constant, immensely strong desire to ruin your own life and make yourself as miserable as possible, even subconsciously using less than your full power just to make this desire become reality. You don’t want to die, just make yourself feel as awful as you can.,,
Growing Pains,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Not all Abnormalities are fully under the control of their Abnormal and this rule applies even more often to Minus. Your powers are the same too, very often randomly lashing out at all those around you with no control on your part possible. Passive abilities that you do not directly control will weaken to varying degrees randomly or even turn off or on entirely at random, without any control from you. You can use your powers at normal when they are not running wild but once they do, you’ll be unable to direct them or shut them off and they won’t differentiate at all between enemy and ally. They won’t harm you too badly and would not directly kill you but they’ll certainly pit you against many people who believe you to be a danger.,,
Normal,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Not an Abnormal and not even a Special, you’re just one of the many entirely Normal students in this world. You lack anything that would make you special compared to a normal human, whether it be a superhuman ability, superpower, special item or super powered friend. Anything you have that could not be possessed by a completely normal human in a normal world, including powers and items and companions, is now sealed off from you. Mundanely possible things, from mundane physical fitness to skills to humanly possible knowledge will all remain however.,,
3,402,193,822,311 Years,,4,,6000,,True,,False,,All the way back to step one for you. You won’t be beginning your jump in the modern world at Hakoniwa Academy. Instead, you’ll be starting several universal deaths and births ago, around the time that Najimi Ajimu was first brought into existence. You’ll need to survive through over 3 trillion years of life, through the universe being born and dying and reborn over and over. Throughout this entire time, you’ll find yourself running into some of the strangest and wildest things in existence. Alien warlords, invaders from outside the universe, different versions of Abnormals, Ajimu herself, magical girls and other fictional entities will be very real parts of your life. Not everything will be threatening to you and you may even find some temporary allies but you will be involved with the story of this world for a very long time.,,Retail Rocker
Cute, Magnificent and Most of All, FRESH,,4,,36000,,True,,False,,The three great terrors, mightiest beings in this world, may each be taken as a potential foe for you to face. This trio are each individually an incredibly powerful opponent, both in raw physical terms and in the strange abilities they have, and if this drawback is taken more than once then they will set aside their differences and work in perfect concert with each other. Each taking of this drawback pits you against one of the three foes below.%%%%The first foe is Lihiko Shishime. The legendary hero of legend himself, this man is faster than light and able to shatter a moon with his bare hands. He is immune to any supernatural ability that is not solely working through language and will become immune to any attack after experiencing it once. Anything he destroys or harms will remain such until he is killed, irreversibly destroyed so long as he lives. He’s a ferocious man but in no way stupid, having thousands of years of experience and combat skill to draw on as he hunts you down.%%%%Medaka Kurokami is the second foe. The brilliant at everything young girl will hunt you with the power she normally only has at the end of the Medaka Box manga, though before she loses her Abnormality. Every bit as fast and strong as Lihiko, Medaka is superhumanly good at everything she does to an absurd extent and has the ability to copy, master and significantly improve any power or ability she even hears about, much less sees. She’s already gathered a vast number of existing abilities and while she will not immediately use her possible chances at instantly winning, she’ll do it soon enough if you don’t take her down.%%%%The final foe is Ajimu Najimi, the futile challenger of Lihiko. Possessing quadrillions of different powers, Ajimu has given up all pretence of holding back. Using the full range of her immense powers to find and kill you, you’ll need to be prepared to fight the girl just short of being a literal God. She can do almost anything and what little she can’t do yet, she can often make herself able to do.,,Taken three times%%Retail rocker
