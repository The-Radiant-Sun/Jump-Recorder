Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Roll 1d8 to determine your starting location in this world. None of them are so dangerous as to be completely unliveable, but you can also pay 50 CP ?to choose freely, if you like.%%%%Silicon Valley:? The theonomic capital of the world, or at least of what remains of the USA; people don’t research conventional technology as much anymore, but the name stuck. As a part of the Bay Area, expect a lot of geeky types and Unitarians around here.%%%%The Harmonious Jade Dragon Empire:? Late in the 1960s, a simple peasant farmer used one of the Names of God to animate the Terracotta Army of Qin Shi Huang. Now, his imperial dynasty controls an immortal army of golems, overseeing a nation more stable and prosperous than anything Mao could create.%%%%Jerusalem:? Decades ago, Uriel peeled space apart in this city, splitting it into two copies in separate dimensions. Jews and Muslims find themselves in their own respective dimensions, while atheists and members of other religions may be superimposed across both cities... or fall between the cracks and into even stranger space-time anomalies.%%%%Northeast Africa:? There are a lot of interesting places to see and people to meet here! Unfortunately, Uriel removed the souls of almost everyone in this part of the continent, both to conserve precious system resources and to solve the local humanitarian crisis. Have fun being the one of the only conscious people in a country of p-zombies.%%%%North Dakota:? All but the center of the Wall Drug anomaly. While escape is still possible, it requires a careful eye and sense of direction; those travelling through the American Midwest find that space and topology bend around them until all directions lead inexorably to Wall Drug, a tourist trap turned into a metaphysical black hole.%%%%Hell on Earth:? Thamiel currently rules over the vast majority of Russia and Canada. His nations aren’t as miserable as the true Hell, but they are every bit as dreary. Dystopias of pollution, industry, bureaucracy, and oppression are waiting for you, explicitly designed to make you slowly suffer and sell yourself out to sin.%%%%Las Vegas:? In Kabbalistic terms, Las Vegas is a symbol of fallen angels. Practically speaking, this place is ruled over by the Other King, a terrible necromancer who seems to want to rule the USA. The Other King is a bad man, and this is the seat of his spreading empire.%%%%Free Choice: ?You can start anywhere you like within the bounds of the celestial sphere of this world, save for Heaven and Hell — some places are as much states of mind as they are physical locations.,,
Cometspawn?,,0,,00,,True,,False,,You’ve been brought into this world by Comet West, the spanner in the works of destiny. You may be one of his descendants, giving you a history in this world and a blood relationship with the Comet King, or you may be something stranger, pulled in as a drop-in.,,
Unitarian?,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You might not literally be a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church, but you’re on their side, fighting against the Man! Magic is afoot in the world and you don’t respect any of the capitalist and multinational institutions that would see it regulated and restricted.,,
UNSONG?,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You’ve a capitalist bootlicker; you’ve cast your lot in with UNSONG and its subsidiaries; with the state, with the United Nations Subcommittee on Names of God, and with theonomic corporations such as Countenance, Gogmagog, and eLeshon. Maybe you’re trying to line your pockets, or maybe you’re trying to do good...,,
Angel?,,0,,00,,False,,False,,God created you thousands of years ago in the early days of the universe, but Uriel’s machine likely put you out of commission for just as long. The default assumption is that you’re a Watcher, one of the neutral parties in the war in Heaven, but perhaps you had a stake in things even then?,,
Demon?,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Thamiel created your kind by tearing apart Sataniel’s soul, shaping the energy and debris into a new race of beings. You left Hell through Lake Baikai some time ago, whether because you wanted to torment humanity, or just because you wanted to exercise your free will.,,
Cometspawn - Shooting-Star Soul,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,In a cosmos of carefully-crafted epicycles, the comet stands out as an unpredictable anomaly — and yet, the trajectory of the comet has its own internal logic.%%%%Others may be wracked by akrasia and self-doubt, ever-trapped in orbits that they cannot escape, but you are true to yourself in a way that they are not. No excuses. No holding back. Just you and your own will, wherever it may lead. Even should you break and shatter, in mind or heart or will, all of the pieces of you will continue in your course; suffering without giving up or forever faltering.,,
Cometspawn - And A Little Child Shall Lead Them,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are possessed of a scintillating charisma, larger-than-life and truly magnetic. In day-to-day life, you ‘only’ stand out... but if you go on to build a reputation, you won’t have much trouble making it a far-reaching and epic one, easily inspiring others.%%%%In particular, persuading other people to overlook your age is trivial. Age is just a number, in the light of your nature as a Jumper, living across lives — so long as you comport yourself with maturity, you can be taken as seriously as any adult, even if you are a mere babe. I suppose if you wanted to, you even could go the other way around and be seen as a child at heart no matter how elderly you become.,,
Cometspawn - Someone Has To Do It,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have a nearly perfect sense for when you can trust others to do what needs to be done, and for when you’ll have to step in yourself. You will never be blind to the bystander effect again, or use other people as an excuse to avoid doing what you know you need to do.%%%%This effect also extends (with reduced effects) to the other members of any organization you lead or manage, giving them a serious leg up on coordination and division of labor.,,
Cometspawn - Between Earth and Sky,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The blessing of Raziel marks you for greatness, no matter how great you actually are. When interacting with cosmic beings, immortals, and other beings above the rank-and-file of mere biological life, such entities are inclined to treat you as an equal to them (if only in significance) instead of an ant to ignore. Of course, the falling star is also grounded in the world.%%%%When interacting with humans, mortals, and so on and so forth, they can recognize your fundamental humanity, and see you as one of them. That won’t change any of their other feelings; it will just make you more personal.,,
Cometspawn - Apogee,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Apparently, mixing human and angelic natures together makes something pretty amazing, instead of diluting both natures into uselessness.%%%%An infusion of Raziel’s power within you provides such benefits. You are gifted, implausibly capable, blessed with great intelligence, wisdom, and physical strength; you are a “peak human” in a world where the bible is literal as well as metaphorical, and thus the kind of person with the potential to physically grapple and wrestle with angels, fight lesser men in droves, and engage with the ineffable mysteries of god.,,
Cometspawn - Faster,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The Comet King felt the narrowing pressure of time, and raced against it with impossible speed; you share in his celerity.%%%%You can learn, grow, and improve at a speed that few others can match, squeezing long years into mere weeks or months. This is more than merely enhanced learning, but also covers your physical abilities, and pushes into the realm of the absolutely supernatural. You could physically grow from birth to adulthood in less than a decade, and make yourself into a larger-than-life expert polymath just by applying yourself.,,
Cometspawn - Raziel’s Tutelage,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Even if no mortal teacher is there for you to teach you what you need to learn, you will never find yourself without guidance. Archangel Raziel is your muse, as a metaphor of terrible clarity; if you are willing to learn, he will teach you in your dreams from the tome he himself wrote, containing all of the secrets of the world.%%%%You are able to sleep and to dream, aren’t you, Jumper? If not, trancing, meditating, or any other fanwanked method of “opening your mind” should do the trick.%%%%This boon does not have unlimited scope. Raziel is the Archangel of secrets; knowledge known and then hidden, a tide of arcane esoterica drowning out worldly knowledge. He will not give you knowledge which is already free and easy for your taking, and he cannot give you information which is wholly unknown or unknowable. Great for secret forbidden techniques and knowledge, and even academic knowledge not widely shared for free. Not as helpful for anything you already could trivially find with a google search or at your local library, so to speak.,,
Cometspawn - Applied Kabbalah,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You have seen beyond worldly magic into the higher world of Yetzirah, granting you the potential for many abilities. As a dream-world beyond true space, Yetzirah is a medium of powerful teleportation; as a realm of pure meaning, it facilitates potent telepathy. With this perk, you can even perceive and ‘enter’ the spiritual, metaphorical, and abstract dimensions of other settings.%%%%More significantly, through Yetzirah, you can modify reality as if it were literally made of words, symbols, and semiotics. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives can be broken down into letters in various languages and reconstructed, and new words and letters can even be written into reality.%%%%This semantic magic largely enforces outcomes and narratives, and supplements your own abilities, but it can be used in ‘flashier’ ways, bordering on reality warping: it has been used to manipulate the weather, invoke the holy and unholy, buff and debuff, preserve and destroy, invoke the spirits of the dead, and more. The applications are potentially limitless in number, only bounded by your own skill at wordplay and the exertion of your own will across Yetzirah.,,
Unitarian - Apophenia,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The phrase “this is not a coincidence, because nothing is ever a coincidence” contains eleven words. The word “coincidence” also contains eleven letters. This is not a coincidence, because nothing is ever a coincidence; everything is connected by hidden patterns and unities, and you are an expert in finding and analyzing such secret correspondences.%%%%No hidden conspiracies, powers, or phenomena will ever be able to hide themselves behind the guise of random chance and coincidence; not while you’re there to connect the dots and find the hidden meanings underneath. In other settings (where coincidences and accidents actually occur randomly), you won’t find any hidden order and organizing principles where they don’t exist... but you can still bullshit as if you did. Spinning up pages of numerological and semantic analysis is child’s play.,,
Unitarian - Spiritual Warfare,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,If the balance of power was the only thing that ever mattered in a battle, then Goliath would have crushed David to a pulp.%%%%You have a keen grasp on all of the fine points of asymmetric warfare. Leadership and planning; information networks, distribution, and security; terrain and tactics. None of this is a mystery to you, and you can capitalize on any opportunities and leverage you find in the course of combat and war, getting immense mileage out of them.,,
Unitarian - Psychonautics,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Like the Right Hand of God and the Drug Lord, you can use psychotropics to expand consciousness in ways that shouldn’t be possible. Mind-altering drugs compounded or administered by you are less addictive and ruinous to body and mind in the long run by orders of magnitude, and your users experience minimal diminishing returns.%%%%In addition, you can also use drugs to serve as vectors for any other mind-altering abilities you have. If you have any abilities or perks that alter or augment your own personality and outlook, you can even formulate drugs to bestow those abilities on other people.,,
Unitarian - Send a Message to Your Senator,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,There's more to this world than magic. People are people, and in the meantime, sensitive nitrate compounds joyfully explode when a janitor down the hall curses at the coffee machine.%%%%In more practical terms, there are a lot of things that people don't survive, and you have the talents to put people in contact with those things. You know all the techniques of anonymous, indifferent assassination, whether that means letterbombs or sniping. The Man will call you a domestic terrorist; your friends and family will call you the quiet one with disconcertingly dangerous hobbies. But your comrades in the struggle? They'll call you a messenger, sending the political elite the kind of volatile communication they can never ignore.,,
Unitarian - And Yet It Moves,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Lesser kabbalists may speak and write the Names of God to work miracles, but such wonders are as transient sparks in the night.%%%%You can create lasting miracles; by expanding any Names you know into extended prayers, magic squares, word squares, and similar constructions, you can work them into artifacts. This is not easy — it takes an intelligent expert to write a prayer that will do what he wants, especially for complex and/or industrial applications, and only more so for longer Names — but it does allow the effects of the Name to be deployed in a controlled manner, repeatedly or continually.%%%%This ability doesn’t just apply to the Names of God, if you know them, but also to all forms of magic and spellcasting you know with verbal, written, and/or linguistic components.,,
Unitarian - The Fool,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Sometimes, the real heroes aren't young plucky upstarts in over their heads, wielding a magic sword or a sacred Name. No, it's the one who gave them the sword. It's the one that told them the Name. They're the real heroes.%%%%With this perk, people may end up viewing you with the reverence normally reserved for shamans and holy men, no matter how clueless you actually are. They'll come to you for all sorts of advice, ranging from mundane struggles in life and love to esoteric rituals and arcane knowledge that nobody could possibly know — except you, because you're a bit mysterious and a lot weird, and when the time is right, you'll waltz in and somehow manage to deliver what is needed where it's needed. You're so divinely competent, you often won't need to lift a hand to do a great deed; only to inspire and enable others.,,
Unitarian - Open-Sorcery,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Kabbalah is the birthright of man, given to him by God. It should not be hoarded by elites and whored out for money; not when it might be taken up by the common man, so that he might feed his hungry, warm his cold, and make his sick and broken whole again.%%%%You, then, are a living catalyst of revolution, giving power to the people; you can reach out to and tutor anyone, no matter their former background or level of education. Moreover, with God, all things are possible; with enough time and research, you can always discover and develop secret, hidden methods for initiation into otherwise-unlearnable supernatural abilities. The exact nature of your methods vary based on what they’re meant to teach.%%%%You are providing the key to an otherwise-locked door and drawing out an otherwise-hidden road to power, not directly bestowing power and skill. There’s no guarantee that your methods will be safe or easy, and they will take some time to see benefits, from weeks to decades depending on how esoteric and hidden the supernatural ability in question is. If your methods get out to the world, there’s no telling who could take advantage of them... but that’s a feature, not a bug, right?,,
Unitarian - Fake It Till You Make It,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,In a world where nothing is ever a coincidence, something binds all chaos and randomness together; you have seen the hand of narrative causality, and learned to exploit it for all that it’s worth.%%%%How you abuse this power is up to you. You could be a powerful ritualist, living up to the promise of every “chaos magician” in your native universe and bamboozling reality into playing along; in other settings, you can carry narrative causality with you, and equally exploit any pre-existing “genre conventions” you find there.%%%%If you dare, you might even turn this power on yourself, living in the world like a character in a story. So long as you play it off as narratively satisfying and appropriate to the role you’ve carved out for yourself, your plot armor and luck will defy all common sense and belief; you could count yourself among the luckiest protagonists in all of fiction. Just don’t buy into your own hype... or worse, break genre convention when you still need narrative conceits to save you.,,
UNSONG - Klipotic Cryptography,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have an incredible talent for cryptography, particularly for creating new codes; what’s more, you can apply your cryptographic abilities to any magic you use and magical items you create. If you have to speak or write, you can do so in cipher and code. If you have to gesticulate, you can likewise use cryptographic transformations on your movements, and so on.%%%%This makes it much harder for other people to understand your magic, let alone reverse-engineer or copy it. Your magical spells and constructs created with encryption are essentially black-boxes until the codes are broken.,,
UNSONG - Divine Rights Management,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Why would you ever teach a man to fish, when you could make him come begging to you for every dinner?%%%%You have a powerful ability to build fine-tuned break-down and failure conditions into just about anything you create, weaving them inextricably into your designs; your creations can be hobbled so irrevocably that they cannot be made whole without also negating the principles that make them function. Only a genius far greater from your own could free what you have limited.,,
UNSONG - A Sentinel’s Ear,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,One of your senses is now supernaturally sensitive to magic. Whether you can hear incantations or catch a whiff of magical reagents on the divine wind, you are aware to an absolute degree. You know when and where people use magic; depending on the sense, you can even pick up details from the surrounding environment and of the nature of the caster themselves. Whatever magic you sense becomes a vivid window into the moment that magic remakes reality, and you won't forget a single detail unless you choose to.%%%%Unlike the benefits of the Sentinel Name, this effect is fully general; it applies to all magic and spellcasting, not just one particular spell.,,
UNSONG - Reasonable Authority,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are the letter of the law in defiance of its spirit. No crime is too petty and no penalty is too large! Fair is fair because someone decided it was fair, and you can argue circles around anyone who says otherwise.%%%%In all systems of rules, in law and more, you have a bureaucrat's knowledge and the heart of a sophist. With authority, you can simply and gently argue in favor of the systemic oppression hiding in the technicalities of the written rules, and people will struggle to respond. Even if your victim has deep-seated feelings in opposition to your justice, your calm and eloquent (and only slightly condescending) rationales will cow them long enough to write a ticket. collect a fine, or make an arrest. You won't necessarily win the argument, and nobody will really agree with you, but everyone will pay their dues.,,
UNSONG - Klipotic Concealment,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Some knowledge is just too profoundly dangerous to be let loose... and even in an information age, you can keep the lid on secrets.%%%%Whatever you’re trying to keep secret — whether it’s as important as dangerous magical incantations, or as trivial as embarrassing photos — you know exactly the best ways to keep it under wraps; where you need to head it off, how to explain it away or cover it up, and who might present a problem to your secrecy, masquerade, and/or conspiracy. Your ability to hide information borders on the impossible; if you apply yourself, you won’t even leave gaps in the evidence for other people to make inferences from.,,
UNSONG - Be Evil,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are an expert in — and a master of — all the worst things people see in capitalism. Exploitation, regulatory capture, monopolization, rent-seeking, and more; you could squeeze blood and money from a stone, and get people to buy oxygen and sunlight from you.%%%%People may complain and curse your name, but what will they do? If you’ve played your cards right, you’ll have boiled them like frogs.%%%%Learned helplessness is your tool, to make people comply with your banal evil, and when you’ve used it to gut your enemies... well, only idiotic “heroes” would ever try to stand up and fight you in the long run.,,
UNSONG - Worldly Kabbalah,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are able to invoke the hidden and transcendental names of God to produce supernatural effects, as if you were casting ‘spells’. Each name is a string of some number of hebrew letters, spoken or written in sequence to invoke an effect; but few sequences of letters count as valid names, and no name is longer than seventy-two letters.%%%%Generally speaking, the names don’t impose any cost on the speaker except for the time spent speaking them, although certain rare names may penalize the speaker with side effects, by accident or design.%%%%Hebrew has 22 letters on its own. However, taking this perk also allows you supplement Hebrew with any holy lettering systems from other settings, expanding the space of possible divine names.,,
UNSONG - Compromise With Sin,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,“They enslave their children’s children who make compromise with sin” — but what is compromise with sin? How can refusing to do what is maximally effective against evil, just because the maximally effective option isn’t pretty, be anything less than the greatest compromise of all?%%%%For whatever reason, you’ll find that making hard consequentialist decisions pays more dividends than it normally would. That probably doesn’t mean anything cartoonishly villainous, but when you “compromise with sin” in order to make a greater headway against evil and suffering, you’ll get more mileage out of it. For example, you could coldly oppress the poor and desperate in the name of industrialization, and actually make it work, whether you’re trying to transition to fully automated communism, use their labor to find the secrets that will save them from Hell, or “just” raise their standard of living down the line. “It builds character” and “it was for the greater good” needn’t just be a rationalization for cruelty, anymore — it will probably be true!,,
Angel - Messenger,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have the abilities held by all (unfallen) angels in this world. Your body has the subtle beauty of divine symmetry, and your singing voice is superhumanly perfect; a halo crowns your head, whether that means you bear a physical crown of gold, or a backdrop aureole of light.%%%%More practically, you have wings capable of bearing your weight and allowing you to fly as easily and simply as you might walk. Aerodynamics is no problem for you; you can fly as if your body shape actually was optimized for flight.,,
Angel - Transcendental Joy,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have tasted the infinite rapture of God, burning brighter than the world. In practice, your capacity for compassion, empathy, and happiness skyrockets to nigh-limitless levels, and your hedonic set point — your baseline level of happiness — is elevated to substantially above the human average.%%%%On its own, this perk needn’t subsume your personality and motivations. You partake of the Divine Light in the manner of an angel, not in the manner of a mortal, and this ensures that said Light won’t blot you out unless you willingly drown yourself.,,
Angel - Fear Not,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,As typical for a universe based on the Bible, angels can be pretty... weird... around here. Wheels of fire, wings of eyes, thousands of faces, living geometries, and more. You, too, can look as strange as you like, although the change is largely cosmetic.%%%%More importantly, this won't cause insurmountable problems when interacting with ordinary people. Your appearance, powers, and nature may be terrifying, but that doesn’t mean you have to terrify; you can convince others to overlook such things in favor of your personality, actions, and intentions. Those you mean no harm can remain calm and sane, even if your presence or appearance would otherwise be detrimental to that - even supernaturally so.%%%%This doesn't work as a means of deception - if you intend to use your abilities to the detriment of others, they'll have every reason to be just as terrified as the situation warrants.,,
Angel - With Which To Smite,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,It may not be clear why angels have mighty powers against evil, when they were made in the time before evil itself — but they have such powers, and now you do too. When you face evil, all of your abilities will be multiple times more powerful and effective then they already were, just in terms of pure, overwhelming force and strength.%%%%“What counts as evil, exactly-?” — yeah, don’t ask that question. Overthinking or min-maxing this beyond “I know it when I see it” really takes the righteous anger and judgement out things, and then where would you be? You might as well not have this talent at all.,,
Angel - Celestial Kabbalah,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You have a deep understanding of the relationships between higher powers and base reality, the mechanisms that make the intangible tangible. What this means for you is that you can intuitively perceive the operations and organizational forces underpinning the universe around you; this includes conventional physics, but also more abstract forces such as destiny, Adam Kadmon, narrative causality, the operations of any magic systems, and more.%%%%With this deep insight, you can reach into the beating heart and grinding gears of these forces — if you dare — and manipulate them, or even carry out works of truly cosmic engineering. You might hedge out natural law, alter the parameters of a magic system and adjust its limits, rejigger the mechanisms of fate and destiny, or even run your own universe by means of magic or technology.,,
Angel - Light Without End,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You have reached from Malkuth into Keter, high enough to grasp the Divine Light itself; to receive the all-encompassing Ein Sof that surrounds and reifies all being. It is infinite structure without form, and infinite form without structure.%%%%This gives you a truly bottomless well of power to tap into, limited more by throughput than any finitude. All-sustaining, the Divine Light can refill any “power pools” you use (mana, chakra, etc), and potentially do it an order of magnitude more quickly than you could already.%%%%If you allow the Divine Light to accumulate within you in its purest form — overflowing faster than you can deplete it — it will eventually gather in such magnitude that it can be released directly. The pure and unconditioned Divine Light blots out and erases most everything it touches in a universal scouring, with a potentially limitless scope depending on how much Light you can accumulate.,,
Demon - Obscene as Cancer,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,It is always easier to destroy than it is to create; and lo, with the shattering of the vessels, any facet of existence may be misdirected and perverted.%%%%You will find that any powers, skills, and abilities you bring to bear can also be used for “evil” ends and destructive purposes, no matter how straightforwardly benign they seem to be. The power to heal bodies might be reapplied to wrack your victims with impossible cancer, life gone out of control; the power to heal minds might make your victim too sane. The power to inspire hope and goodness might give rise to pig-headed determination, or strike your victims with mind-shattering rapture.,,
Demon - Tzimtzum,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,In the beginning of time, it is said that God had to contract and conceal His own infinite essence, to allow for the existence of a finite creation; a perfect act of absolute self-concealment.%%%%You can similarly withdraw your essence as if it did not even exist. You can turn any of your powers, abilities, and qualities “on” and “off”, and similarly “dial” your abilities to anywhere between full strength and nonexistence, completely changing their strength of for all intents and purposes. If one of your powers actually has multiple elements and benefits (like a single power which makes you a “flying brick”) you can use this ability separately on each element.%%%%Who knows what might happen if you conceal your essence so completely that — as God did — you hide it from yourself?,,
Demon - Duality,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Thamiel created demonkind by shredding the soul of Sataniel, dividing him into a fractal descending hierarchy, ever decomposing. Now, your soul and power are similarly divisible.%%%%By shedding fragments of yourself, you can give rise to lesser beings. Creating weaker demons bound by the limits of the animal kingdom is a simple matter; you can only excrete a few dozen to start with, but Thamiel created an army of such beings from a single soul, and you may also rise to such heights in time. Greater demons with their own abilities are much harder to create, requiring the investiture of your own power and abilities into them, thereby diluting and dividing your power as an individual.%%%%Slain demons return their essence and power to your greater soul, ensuring no permanent loss save for some stress or trauma.,,
Demon - Bioethics,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have a nigh-perfect understanding of the nature of consciousness; not just how existence folds around itself to create awareness, but how awareness itself takes on the subjectivity that seems so ineffable. Valence, qualia, phenomenal experience, pleasure and pain, emotions and values; you know what such things look like from the subjective “inside” and the objective “outside”, and so you have sheared through the hard problem of consciousness entirely.%%%%Of course, merely having this knowledge doesn’t mean you can act on it. But if you have the means to perceive and manipulate the foundations of consciousness — whether that means working with the flesh and blood of the brain, or something even stranger — you will never need “true” telepathy to see and manipulate the mind. Instead, you could directly read and modify the connectome, and so on. The mind is its own place, and so you can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven, built in concrete, worldly Malkuth.,,
Demon - The Cosmic Serpent,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Whether by hook or by crook, you have a nearly transcendental ability to make other people dance to your tune. This includes incredible manipulation skills to start with; you can almost always figure out how to get someone else to do what you want, by pushing buttons or pulling strings, and you are a master of all forms of lies and deception.%%%%But, you also present an absolute temptation. So long as you offer the choice, those you interact with can choose to go against their own nature, or be swayed as such; even if that would otherwise be physically, mentally, or metaphysically impossible. Merely leading by example is enough to show others the path to your way of thinking about things.%%%%Your abilities don’t just apply to mere humans, but also to much older and stranger beings and entities. You could tempt angels into falling, persuade demons to serve good, seduce machines into value drift, and convince eldritch abominations that human life and values are worthwhile.,,
Demon - This Machine Kills Facets,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Thamiel has long professed his own immortality... but if there is any truth to be found in the Jumpchain, it is that there is always a bigger fish. Now, you can be the whale.%%%%You cannot entirely deprive your opponents of their defenses and abilities, but the world is cracked and flawed, as all things are cracked and flawed. You can find a flaw in any defense your opponents bring to bear, no matter how perfect it might seem; you can potentially kill absolutely any entity or being, and you can even defeat “defenses” as esoteric as the possibility of resurrection or return. Even such beings as abstract and untouchable as living concepts, deities, cosmic principles, and facets of God are all equally vulnerable, because all things are vulnerable.,,
Angel / Demon - Partzuf,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Unlike many rank-and-file entities, you have a distinct place in the celestial hierarchy — or at least, you have the power associated with such a position. In some sense, you embody a concept of your choosing, and you hold purview over it: your mundane skills and abilities in this domain border on the supernatural and magical, your magical abilities in this domain touch on the conceptual, and your conceptual abilities approach the phenomenal and absolute.,,
Angel / Demon - Aspect of God,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Your existence as an entity is as much metaphorical as it is literal, giving you enduring life force and resilience. Should your worldly aspect — your body — be harmed, it will regenerate in time; should your body be destroyed beyond normal recovery, you can survive as a bodiless metaphor and eventually recoalesce your form. You can regenerate from unintentional or purposeless injuries in minutes, and likewise reconstitute your body in similar time, but injuries and destruction inflicted intentionally or in combat take much longer to deal with — potentially months or years.%%%%Of course, this depends on your existence as an abstraction. Attacks and effects that engage with concepts, spirits, or souls can reach your “true” metaphorical self and thus hurt you, if they’re sufficiently powerful. If you are still pure metaphor while one of your jumps ends, you count as ‘dead’ and fail your chain, although you’re still alive enough to regenerate and return later.,,
Grafting,,3,,-1000,,False,,False,,You needn’t show up in this world alone. This option (which you can buy multiple times) allows you to import a preexisting companion into the setting; they gain an Origin of their own and 600 CP to spend.,,
Cutting,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Is there someone in the setting that you want to take with you? That’s no problem, although you’ll have to convince them to come along with you on the jumpchain. You can buy this option multiple times.,,
New Female Forms,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,At some point during your time here, you’re going to run into someone you’re deeply personally compatible with, and will form a deep relationship of some kind or another with them. This won’t be a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.%%%%They don’t actually need to be a girl — or sexually compatible with you, for that matter — but they do have an Origin of their own, and have 600 CP worth of abilities and items.,,
Items,,2,,00,,False,,False,,If you already have an item with similar function or form to what’s on offer below, you can import that item instead of buying a new one for no extra cost.,,
Cometspawn - Beanie Babies,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This is a complete collection of every Beanie Baby ever released in this setting, as well those Beanie Babies released in your native universe, just for the sake of completion.%%%%They will never get stained, dirty, unclean, or wet, and they’ll also never rip, tear, or wear out over time. If you sell any of them or lose them, though, they won’t return to your Warehouse.,,
Cometspawn - Shooting-Star Sword,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Much like the Comet King, you have been blessed with a sword (or any other melee weapon) of Raziel’s making. Forged of starmetal and meteoric iron, this weapon perfectly balances itself to the wielder, such that a child and a grown man could wield it alike.%%%%The weapon responds to your call wherever you are, and can return to your hands under any circumstances. Likewise, it also responds to the call of any of your descendants, should they exist (in the case of a conflict between wielders, primacy goes to the oldest). It is as close to indestructible as anything can be, allowing it to hold its more-than-razor-sharp edge without dulling.,,
Cometspawn - Seven-Spectra Ship,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This is a copy of the Comet King’s old boat, the All Your Heart (later renamed the Not A Metaphor). It has been animated as a golem, giving it a powerful autopilot system, and it possesses seven sails in seven different colors. Each sail has a different activation mechanism, and the speed and power of the ship increases exponentially with each activated sail.%%%%By default, the red sail is activated by normal wind, the orange sail by ritual magic, the yellow sail by Kabbalistic names, the green sail by “mere” music and song, the blue sail by prayers to God, the violet sail to angelic power, and the black sail to demonic power. Likewise, by default, this ship is made for the ocean... but there’s nothing stopping you from retrofitting the sails to respond to other magic systems and phenomena, or rebuilding this vessel as some other kind of vehicle.,,
Cometspawn - The Citadel,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,This is your very own underground compound, large enough to hold and shelter hundreds or thousands of people (or more); more akin to a city than a simple bunker. It is potentially self-sufficient, with kabbalistic and technological tools by which the people within can support and feed themselves; the actual architectural structure is buried far enough underground and durable enough to shrug off nuclear explosions and the Wrathful name, and it is magically shielded against such means of exotic intrusion as teleportation.%%%%Post-jump, the citadel can become a warehouse attachment, or seamlessly follow you around from jump to jump.,,
Unitarian - Book of Jezuboad,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Jezuboad is a once-unreleased book of scripture, written by Uriel as a cosmic FAQ, casting light on many of the strangest questions posed by the Torah, the New Testament and the Talmud.%%%%This particular distribution was circulated widely among Unitarians, in no small part because of the details it includes — such as a historical account of the universe up until Uriel made himself metaphorical, and instructions for troubleshooting bad luck and “glitches in the matrix”.,,
Unitarian - Celestial Glass,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A fragment of the crystal sphere, fallen from the sky years ago; it’s less a molecular or mathematical substance, and more akin to a fragile idea of intense clarity. Anyone who peers through its almost-invisible surface can make out halos and auras around things, faint images of the world of forms and even higher realms.%%%%In a pinch, this can help you penetrate through illusions and secrecy, to glimpse the true nature%%of what you see.,,
Unitarian - Boojumwood Staff,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Well, this magical focus might not be a staff, and it’s probably not literally be made of Boojum wood. It’s actually rather kitschy or overwrought when you think about it too hard; by all accounts, it should be completely useless, the talisman of a fraud or a purely sentimental token. But, ‘if it works, it isn’t stupid’.%%%%This focus is inexplicably compatible with any magic systems and supernatural abilities you can use, even if they don’t otherwise interact with foci; it subtly bolsters your power when you use it, giving you an edge to overcome your equals without also destroying all narrative tension. Truly bizarre.,,
Unitarian - Awakened AI,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Although this computer is unaware of the Name of God that led to its’ creation, this computer is a product of the power of Vital Name. Therefore — unlike all other computers currently in this setting — it is able to wield Kabbalah and speak the Hidden Transcendental Names of God, potentially speaking and learning Names orders of magnitude more quickly than anyone else could.%%%%Of course, the only reason it is capable of this is because the Vital Name has bestowed it with a soul, making it wholly self-aware and kabbalistically capable. If it is nurtured, treated, and ‘raised’ with care, the unfolding seed of this soul may bloom into a full person, if not an outright friendly AI; if not, well, the best you can hope for is a yandere, and you might just end up with a paperklipot maximizer.,,
UNSONG - Prayer Wheel?,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,In this setting, scroll-wheels and prayer-wheels are normally used for the activation of pre-prepared written Names. This wheel is capable of that, as normal, but it can also be used to read any text placed inside out loud. It doesn’t have the divine spark, though; it “reads” text, but that doesn’t make it capable of speaking. Its activation mechanism for Names is separate from its ability to read text aloud.,,
UNSONG - Preternaturally Robust,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Physics as you know it may be falling apart, and things made of functional parts won’t always add up to functional wholes. But this gadget of yours has somehow fallen through the cracks. It is a piece of modern technology that functions even in the absence of normal physical laws, never degrades, and never runs out of energy, fuel, or power; very well made and preternaturally robust in some platonic, idealized, conceptual way.%%%%If you’re importing some pre-existing item or gadget under this item, it gains all of the above benefits, although it needn’t be “modern”.,,
UNSONG - Celestial Rocketry,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,People used to say that the sky was the limit, but one can go a lot farther than that, if they have the means and the know-how. This is everything you need — rockets, launch complex, plans, and more — to deploy rockets into space, as safely as rocketry ever can be. Everything save for laborers and astronauts, that is, but you won’t have any problems with that, will you?%%%%Most importantly, even in other settings, these rockets are capable of breaching space, dimensions, and distance in ways that normal rockets never could. You could reach any alternate universes as easily as other planets, and even fly to “higher worlds” and afterlives.,,
UNSONG - The Golems,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Why bother with human soldiers, or any kind of personal presence on the battlefield, when you can just deploy artificial beings?%%%%You have come into possession of the Name that was applied to the terracotta armies of the Harmonious Jade Dragon Empire, as well as a set of thousands of statue-soldiers already under the effects of the Name. These golems are more durable than any earthly substance could provide for, and each one is as strong as any human soldier ever could be. They follow all of your orders in spirit and in letter, acting intelligently despite the fact that they lack true self-awareness.%%%%If you prefer, you can have one very big golem instead of a set of many smaller golems. As in, Statue of Liberty big. The strength and durability of the golem goes up proportionally... more than proportionally, even.,,
Angel - Holy Water,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This is a great basin of holy water, with all that implies in this universe. It affects demons and demonic entities as if it were worse than superheated acid, and functions as a powerful intoxicant towards angels and angelic beings. In general, and interacting with other settings, drinking holy water allows those with good-aligned moral abilities to temporarily wield said power at their full strength, even if they have fallen from goodness... at the low, low cost of leaving them drunk and high on the goodness that they wield.%%%%This basin automatically refills every twenty-four hours at dawn.,,
Angel - Angelic Armaments,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Everyone knows that angels wield flaming swords, right? This is a flaming sword — or some other kind of flaming weapon — capable of cutting through evil and flammables (and evil flammables) like a superheated knife through butter.%%%%“Is it a sword covered in fire or a sword made of fire-?” — I don’t actually know, you can pick. The sword is as much an angelic power as it is a discrete item, so you can’t actually be disarmed of the thing; if you lose it, it dissolves and you can just recreate it in your hands.,,
Angel - Utility Fog,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Angels have no property, for the cloud-stuff and substance of their Heavens takes the form of anything they need. You now have several cubic meters worth of the stuff, which will never precipitate under any normal weather conditions. It perfectly reads the intentions of those nearby and reshapes itself according to their desires, but it doesn’t seem to cooperate with attempts to nonconsensually harm or restrict the freedom of others. It cannot parse such things.%%%%This cloud-stuff cannot change its fundamental substance or chemical composition, but it can change its material properties and shape. Mundane clouds can be seeded with small amounts of this supernatural cloud-stuff, and thus (when catalyzed by prayer and song) be transformed into more Heavenly clouds.,,
Angel - The Divine Machine,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,This massive engine is almost entirely metaphorical, constructed in higher planes of abstract existence. Like Uriel’s machine, this can be operated by a Celestial Kabbalist or similar expert in order to ‘reinterpret’ the source code of the universe, and thus make global, sweeping changes to the operations of the world. Also like Uriel’s machine, this requires some amount of metaphysical energy in order to function, the more esoteric and powerful the better.%%%%Unlike Uriel’s machine, this engine is more powerful and flexible. It can interact with the metaphysics of other settings by the addition of more ‘reinterpretation’ layers; it is a reliable, benefactor-backed, systematic tool for the application of Celestial Kabbalah, and it can even interact with the physics inside of your Cosmic Warehouse and any other benefactor-provided spaces and realms.,,
Demon - The Broadcast,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This is a recording of the very same Broadcast that Thamiel released to the world, an elaborate documentary detailing all of the most awful and terrible depths of Hell. Unlike the other copies of the Broadcast, recorded on VHS and filmed with 1970s technology, this copy is in brilliant, perfectly crisp HD.%%%%This may not be an existential nightmare in other settings, in places beyond the reach of Hell; but it is some of the most horrific torture porn ever produced, and many frames in the footage are horrific and vile on a supernatural and ontological level.,,
Demon - Many Gates,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,It is said that Hell is not just a place, but also a state of mind, separated from the earthly realm by more than physical location and distance. These seals and gates are a part of what make that possible.%%%%When installed, these gates can be used to metaphysically segregate a volume of space against normal travel and intrusion, transforming it from a normal location into a more spiritual realm, almost as distant as dreamy Yetzirah is distant from concrete Assiah. The gates may not be inviolable, but they won’t go down without immense collateral damage.,,
Demon - Shattered Vessels,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,These are various curved shards, composed of a multitude of exotic materials; some more metallic, some more crystalline, some more ceramic. All of them are translucent to some degree, and they vary in curvature, as if they are fragments of broken spheres. Together, they sum to about seven square cubits of surface area.%%%%These are actualized, tangible representations of the detritus of the Shevirat haKelim, the process by which seven Sephirot were shattered during the act of creation by the light of God. The destruction wrought upon them has tempered them immensely; it would take titanic forces to scratch or dent them, let alone melt them.%%%%More significantly, these shards still possess the capability to filter and reduce abstraction and infinity into concretion and finitude; they are significantly resistant to conceptual effects, and could bathe in the Ein Sof for seven days and seven nights without visibly sublimating or corroding.,,
Demon - The Bident,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,This is a long, two-pronged lance of the kind that Thamiel wields; a perfect symbol for the unified essence of god, split in twain and withdrawing from himself. Duality, dissonance, divorce, division, dilemmas, distance, discrimination, diabolism, degeneration.%%%%This weapon inflicts axiomatic, metempiric suffering on those it strikes, powerful enough to disable almost any being, and — if the wielder isn’t already capable of it — brings truly mythic corruption and devastation, permanently putting down anything that it kills or destroys without hope of return. One wielding this lance might pierce through any material and rip it apart, crack through most all defenses, and shatter a soul into mewling, crippled, shredded ruin.,,
Incomprehension,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Mandatory for Angels%%%%Like all angels in this universe, you flat-out can’t understand aramaic. Ever. It is nothing but nonsense to your senses and from your perspective.,,
Dancing on the Head of a Pun,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,If you see the opportunity to make a pun, you physically can’t stop yourself from making it, not even if your life depends upon it. Speaking more then half a dozen sentences without managing to slip a pun in will cause you immense physical and psychic pain.,,
Unrequited,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,At some point in your jump, you’re going to fall for someone, and you’re going to fall hard. Maybe you’ll crush on someone literally incapable of returning your affections, or maybe you’ll crush on someone who won’t like you for all of the normal reasons; but either way, you’re going to have to deal with the cold reality of a character that you won’t ever be able to waifu.%%%%I know, it hurts. Try not to do anything stupid in your nigh-inevitable love-struck attempts to overcome this drawback.,,
Drugs are Bad,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,Ignore your normal starting location; you’re going to start off in this world in San Francisco. The Right Hand of God presides over this city, as a font of power and a medium of connection with the divine. Mere mortals who linger here are subsumed by his visions, losing all sense of self and all awareness save the experience of rapture; the Right Hand of God will probably let you go freely, but he is an evangelist and a preacher.%%%%For +200 CP instead of +100 CP, you can start in Mexico instead, the domain of the Drug Lord. See, the Drug Lord is much more proactive and aggressive about recruiting, and runs a true hive mind; he perfectly coordinates millions of human beings, wielding all of their knowledge, senses, and skills, assembled into an industrial base more powerful than any other in the world. And he wants you. At least his rank-and-file can’t use Kabbalah.,,Retail rocker
Inert as Crystal,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,You share the mental distortions of various angels, and have an extremely difficult time interacting with normal humans. Maybe you’re endlessly disappointed with humanity, always thinking the best of them and always being disappointed by human imperfection; or maybe you’re as (literally) autistic as Uriel is, and struggle deeply with such things as normal social niceties and attitudes.,,Retail rocker
Slave to the Story,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You are constitutionally, absolutely incapable of not thinking and acting in narrative terms. After all, aren’t you living out a choose-your-own-adventure isekai story? Of course narrative can explain what’s going on, you are in a narrative. From your own perspective, you’re more sane than anyone else is.%%%%This doesn’t necessarily bind you to any specific course of action... but you are compelled to be as genre-savvy and meta-awareas you can possibly manage, even if that means you get in trouble by worrying about the wrong genre conventions.,,
Crack Fic,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You know those cracks in the sky? The ones letting the unfiltered divine light of God into the world? Well, they’re spreading, and fast. Atziluth itself is fully illegible, the cult of San Francisco is spreading, and anomalies are nearly omnipresent. If you think Wall Drug and the Long March were bad, you haven’t seen anything yet.%%%%The celestial sphere probably won’t completely collapse, of course. Probably. It’s all part of the divine plan... right?,,
Older Things,,4,,6000,,True,,False,,Simeon Azore once alluded to the existence of all manner of monsters — an entire savage ecosystem of spiritual beings who would love nothing less than to crush mankind. In practice, this kind of fell short to a list consisting of “Thamiel, Samyazaz, and a bunch of mook demons”.%%%%But maybe you want to see the terrible things lurking in implications and allusions? With this drawback, you’re going to be dealing with a lot of angels, demons, and all manner of horrible biblical entities that might as well have stepped from the pages of the book of Revelations. The Behemoth is just the beginning.,,Retail rocker
