Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Transfer Student,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Transfer Student is actually a name for members of a certain Majin organization. They’re summoned from parallel worlds and timelines to fulfill their clients’ requests. Mass terrorism, indiscriminate murder sprees, national revolutions, any evil act will be completed without qualm. Be mindful, you’re more of an unpaid intern than an actual Transfer Student. As you likely lack the unreasonable strength and durability that Transfer Students are so infamous for.%%%%You’ll be accompanying three Transfer Students who were called to the Harmageddon to wipe out every other Majin involved, in return for the body of the student Saki Amane.,,
Student Council,,0,,00,,False,,False,,When the school was in a state of pure lawless anarchy under the previous Banchou Group, it was Takuya Doseigi alone who brought the guilty parties involved to an early grave. Even if the stress of his position as Student Council President has been chipping away at his sense of ethics, you’ve decided to stand by his side still. Some of the other members are a bit twisted in their own right, and their methods can be a bit extreme, but that’s just what it means to live as Majin! At least you’re doing some good for the school.%%%%That being said, the actions of one of your own members resulted in the loss of one of the Banchou Group’s strongest Majins, rendering deescalation between the two all but impossible.,,
Banchou Group,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The scum of the student body. Feared by all as a depraved, violent, and lawless bunch. Well, that’s the image you guys work hard to keep up. There are Majins too dangerous or twisted for even the Student Council to manage. In those cases, the Banchou Group steps in to keep them under control. Invite the ones who can be reasoned with, kill the ones who can’t. That balance brought lasting peace to this school, but the Student Council has stepped out of line too many times. Following the assassination of Kotoba Kusetsuin at what was supposed to be a deescalation party, The only course of action left to you is a battle to the death.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon,,0,,00,,False,,False,,There are only two futures that a Majin has to look forward to once they no longer have the School Autonomous Rule Law to protect them: die like a dog, or live like one. You serve as the Japanese government’s response to Majin-related incidents that are far too delicate to be handled by the regular Majin Police. In this instance, you were assigned to instigate a war between the Student Council and Bancou Group of Kibousaki Academy, in order to put a stop to the revolutionary-minded Doseigi and his ambitions of nation-founding.%%%%Once the two sides have exhausted each other, you’re job is to step in and kill any survivors.,,
Mad Majin Magic,,1,,00,,True,,True,,As fantastic as a Majin’s unique power may be, that’s far from their only defining quality. Absolutely all Majins, regardless of their power, are blessed with peak-to-superhuman level strength, speed, and durability. You can outrun anything slower than a motorcycle, shatter bones with glancing blows, and get back up from anything less than sustained gunfire. This is only average as far as Majins go.%%%%Buying this also ensures that you enter this world as a Majin, and lets you access the power customization table.,,
Suffer Disaster,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Easily one of the most convenient features of this world. The moment that a Majin awakens to their power, they are given full instinctual comprehension of their power, right then and there. Everything from the power’s name, how it can be used, ideal conditions for use, and even the power’s maximum output and growth potential. Every single aspect of their power in its current state is wired permanently into their instincts in the same moment they recieve it. Naturally, this now applies to you for Majin power’s you’ve developed in this world.%%%%If you pay an additional 200CP, this also applies to powers obtained in future worlds as well, and even retroactively to powers you already possess.,,
Loved By God,,1,,12000,,True,,True,,This may sound a bit strange, but almost all Majin powers are considered “absolute” in a rather roundabout sense of the word. While many have in-built limitations and weaknesses, those are also just manifestations of how a Majin perceives the world. However, what if two Majin powers happen to contradict each other? Not just having poor chemistry, or hard-countering each other. What if the delusions of two different Majins are so different, so inherently incompatible, that it’s conceptually impossible for both powers to take effect in the same place and time? Think of an unbeatable shield, facing off against an unbeatable spear. However, there are no draws in Majin battles. Most would say that the winner is decided by pure luck, but in reality, there is a God watching over this world, one who decides how any such conflict should end, based on their own subjective preferences.%%%%%%This is often decided on a case by case basis, however, there exist a few, special beings who are truly loved by God. You could think of these people as having “precedence” compared to other Majins. Just as Majin perceptions take inherent precedence over normal humans, those who are loved by God take precedence over most other Majins as well. For 400CP?, you are one such existence. As such, barring other special existences like yourself, the “absoluteness” of your own abilities will always surpass that of others, and you will always win otherwise irreconcilable conflicts between powers. When faced with infinity, your infinity is objectively bigger. Even when you come across such a transcendent being, conflicts of absolutes with them will be treated like ordinary perception conflicts, allowing both sides an equal and semi-random chance of winning.%%%%%%If you pay an additional 800CP,? you will receive something truly special on top of that. After experiencing such a conflict of perceptions yourself, even unknowingly, you will be rewarded with a small cog in your mind. This cog spins infinitely and aimlessly, but as you come closer to a certain realization regarding your precedence, it will begin to spin faster, and more mechanisms will connect to it. It’s up to you to find what this truth is, but once it’s found, this perfect machine in your mind will be completed, and you will awaken to a new power, in addition to the unique Majin power you already possessed.%%%%This power in question is shared by all Transfer Students, often called “unlimited strength”. You can think of this as your precedence extending from your power to your body, granting you priority over the physical world. Without the slightest exaggeration, your body is both an unstoppable force and an immovable object. Without even tensing your muscles, your attacks carve through absolutely any matter effortlessly, and your defenses are similarly infinite. Not even supersonic impacts could move a single hair on your head. You also no longer age, for some reason. The unfortunate drawback to this power is that you’re unable to control your strength. You can perform casual or passive actions like using a cellphone, eating, walking, etc., but the instant you try to put deliberate violent force into an action, you’re back to carving through torsos. With dedicated practice and concentration, you may get the hang of living a normal life with this excessive strength.%%%%This can be used for purposes other than combat, like heavy lifting, but this isn’t conventional physical strength. Your body isn’t moving that fast or exerting that much force, so you won’t be decapitating people with air pressure, or kicking yourself into space. It might be easier to think of this power as infinite inertia, rather than infinite force. That being said, you only exert the full extent of your force through your own body, with diminishing returns the farther away it extends. So thrown projectiles will “only” hit like an armor piercing rounds, and stomps will destroy parks, rather than planets.%%%%The distinction between “attacks” and “non-attacks” can work to your detriment as well. If you want to think of it like an RPG, the strength of a Transfer Student lets you dish out infinite physical damage with each hit, and protect you from 100% of incoming damage, but provides no defense against status effects or debuffs. Your power will not protect you from starvation, suffocation, poison, curses, diseases, hypothermia, heart attacks, or pretty much any Majin power that doesn’t rely on direct physical attacks. While a nuclear explosion couldn’t leave a scratch on you, you’d drop dead once the radiation catches up. Basically, any effect that doesn’t qualify as a conventional physical attack will bypass these defenses.%%%%Incidentally, This Majin power interacts with the bodies of other Transfer Students normally, and vice versa, as if neither of you had this power to begin with. This isn’t a “contradiction” for the purposes of the base power, that’s just how the power works.,,
Transfer Student - Logically Strong,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Despite how they carry themselves, Transfer Students are not invincible. They can be beaten, they can be killed, especially when Majin powers are involved. You have internalized your limitations, and as it stands, no amount of strength on your part will allow you to underestimate your opponents.%%%%No matter how strong you get, or how weak your opponent seems, your guard won’t drop for a second, as long as there’s a greater than 0% chance of your opponent ending you.%%%%This added caution isn’t particularly stressful for you either, but you can suppress this mentality anyway, if you wish.,,
Transfer Student - That’s The Rule,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The foundational of Transfer Student work is the client’s contract. When you agree upon a clearly defined contract with someone, you can enter a special state of mind, where knowingly violating it becomes incomprehensible to you, and clients always sense this reliability.%%%%Thankfully, this is accompanied by an almost precognitive awareness of exploitable loopholes in any such contract, to make sure that you don’t lock yourself into any self destructive jobs, and that you always have a clear way out if things go south anyway.,,
Transfer Student - A Joyous Memory,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,If Majins are beings that force their perceptions onto others, than you epitomizes this phenomenon. By spending large quantities of time with certain people, you can choose to passively force your personality, skills, mentality, delusions, and general worldview onto others.%%%%You won’t be giving out externalized supernatural powers this way, but you can imagine how much simpler it is to amass allies once all of them share the exact same values and mentality as you.%%%%You can even project aspects of your mentality that you really shouldn’t be able to teach, like your ability to memorize, or your sanity. Still, nothing that extends outside the mind itself. As long as you’re deliberate with your actions, you can freely choose what aspects of yourself you force onto others in this way.,,
Transfer Student - Muniversal Appeal,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Naturally, people skills are necessary for any professional, but your definition of “people” seems just a bit broader than others.%%%%As long as the other party has the means to recognize your attempts to communicate, then you can translate all of the charisma you hold with human beings for use on obviously inhuman minds. You just have that special kind of intuition, I suppose. No matter what the other beings idea of courtesy or common sense may be, your attempts to communicate will intuitively match whatever that being qualifies as charismatic, proportional to your charisma with humans. This does apply to animals and such, to an extent, but their lack of sapience severely limits the kind of ideas you can articulate to them.,,
Transfer Student - A World Without You,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,?The reality known by Shiki House is one of countless parallel worlds and timelines. Whenever travelling to alternate timelines, universes, or even other jumps, you’ll come across alternate versions of those you’ve met in previous worlds. Many details may change, but they’re always otherwise recognizable.%%%%Your emotional bonds that you form with people in past worlds somehow manages to carry over to these alternate versions. They may not have all the same memories, but from the first time they lay eyes on you, they’ll share the same emotional attachments to you as their counterparts from other worlds. Allowing you to progress your relationships with people, even once you’ve long since left their universe behind.,,
Transfer Student - Sorry And Goodbye,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Transfer Students and weapons aren’t exactly known for going well together. Their bare hands are usually more than enough to put any mundane weapon to shame. In your case, it seems that the structural integrity and force of anything you use as a weapon is proportional to the force you swing it with. Even objects that you really shouldn’t be able to swing around in one piece, like buildings, or people, they’ll always somehow hold themselves together.%%%%This durability boost only increases up to that of your own body plus that of the weapon. This allows your weapons to hit with at least the same destructive force as attacks made with your own body.,,
Transfer Student - Innumerable in Existence,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,This is a bit sudden, but do you believe in aliens? How about Bigfoot? Mothman? Rasputin? Why couldn’t things like those be real, if something as absurd as Majins can?%%%%In any world you visit, such urban legends and occult phenomenon will retroactively become reality.You can freely control how pronounced this effect is.%%%%At the weakest, true urban legends actively become more mundane near you. You could also make it so that broad concepts like UFO’s and sea monsters exist, but are conveniently out of sight. If you turn it all the way up, even recent rumors and baseless gossip will become true, as long as they’ve spread enough. Urban legends or rumors that you directly or indirectly create are unaffected by this aura. This effect can be stretched far enough to cover a large city, at most.%%%%Once the fantastical things created through this power leave this aura, they will start to become actively more mundane, like bigfoot becoming a bear, a UFO becoming a weather balloon. They will naturally revert to their fantastical selves once back within your aura.,,
Transfer Student - Shiki House,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,It seems that you were in the right place all along. You’re either a new member of Shiki House, or one of their many incarnations across the multiverse. You now have “shiki” as part of your surname.%%%%Your position has made you exceptionally skilled at appeasing and entertaining mentally impaired children, gods, and mentally impaired gods. Any such beings will be predisposed to liking to you, though this only accounts for the first impression.%%%%More impressively, you receive the ability to travel to and from parallel realities. These parallel worlds are more or less identical, barring slight differences, like people leading different lives, or events occurring in slightly different ways.%%%%You won’t find any versions of yourself or your companions with all their powers from other settings.%%%%You also can’t just wish yourself to arrive at a world that meets all your needs, you have to navigate all these parallel worlds personally.,,
Student Council - First Grade Execution,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The Student Council is nothing more, and nothing less than the protectors of the peace. You may need to use cruel and unusual methods to get your point across, but everyone understands on some level that these steps are necessary.%%%%You will never find yourself judged or persecuted for your acts of cruelty, so long as those actions are performed with law and order as your main intention.%%%%Moreover, no matter what lines you cross to get it, people will always be appreciative of any peace you’ve created for them.,,
Student Council - This One Cares Not,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,This is... a bit less conventional than the other abilities offered in this section, but on account of the disposition of the Student Council Vice President, this feels necessary. You now have full retroactive control over the virginity of yourself and your companions. You can make non-virgins into virgins and vice versa, or even finer control over just how much of a virgin or non virgin they are.%%%%Somehow, these changes never massively alter the past, barring inconsequential changes to disposition and biology. You can also apply this to less vulgar, but ultimately trivial biological firsts, like their first kiss, or first cold.%%%%You can freely choose how aware you or your companions are of these retroactive changes.,,
Student Council - My Personal Wish,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Mixed in with all those who allied with the Student Council for self gratification or personal gratitude to Doseigi, there are just as many that signed up out of a personal sense of honor and obligation.%%%%Fitting with that personality, you’ve acquired a talent for duels. Not for winning, mind you, but for arranging them.%%%%If you request a 1-on-1 duel with someone, assuming that this turn of events doesn’t give you some obvious and overwhelming additional advantage, opponents will more often than not accept.%%%%Moreover, when engaged in a personal duel, it is all but impossible for opponents to hold back if you don’t want them to. You can’t make opponents hold back any more than they were already planning to, but if you ask them to give their all, they won’t be able to hold back even .1%.,,
Student Council - Harmful Armageddon,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,?There’s a reason the Dangerous Harmageddon was so easily accepted by the Banchou Group, who would usually know better than to attack the Student Council head-on. Namely, the conditions of the Harmageddon completely seal away Doseigi’s overpowered instant kill ability. Now, you can set up similar scenarios.%%%%You can seal away powers that you or your allies possess, with their consent, for prolonged periods of time. Your enemies will always somehow find out when you’ve sealed powers this way, and will be strongly compelled to capitalize on this chance, often without taking the proper precautions.%%%%The strength of this compulsion depends on how far you weaken yourself, relative to your to your enemies. If you’re still infinitely more powerful than your opponents, then they’d still likely have the sensibility to let the chance pass. If you bring yourself down to equal or lesser power, they would rush over on the spot, without any plans or precautions.%%%%Thankfully, this doesn’t impede your ability to set up traps ahead of time.,,
Student Council - Why Won’t You Kill me!,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The real question is, why won’t you die? For reasons that cannot be explained by biology, tenacity, or even your Majin power, you were blessed from birth with a superhuman life force.%%%%You aren’t any more durable than before, but your body just refuses to die. You can be strangled for hours without passing out, have your neck slit, or your broken, and expect it to actually heal in time. Even as you’re loaded full of gunfire, you can get back up like nothing happened.%%%%You don’t heal any faster than before, but you can eventually recover from things that shouldn’t heal period, and vital organs aren’t really that vital, as long as they’re in mostly one piece, so it doesn’t matter. It all still hurts though.%%%%You can still be killed or crippled if parts of your body are completely destroyed or severed, rather than just badly damaged.,,
Student Council - No Less Pitiful,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,One of the more blatant loopholes in place to avoid prosecuting Majin crimes. In this society, crimes committed as an unavoidable result of a Majin possessing a given power are completely exempt from legal action. Now, you take this effect with you into future worlds.%%%%For any crime you commit due to aspects of your supernatural powers outside of your control, like fully automatic abilities, or something like killing impulses, or an alternate personality, will never be officially prosecuted.%%%%On a personal level, this might still change how people act around you, some might still seek revenge, but no system of laws or rules will ever attempt to punish you for this, even if they’re not aware of your power.,,
Student Council - The Century’s Worst Law,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,I believe this has already been mentioned, but the main reason for the vulgar state of Majin education is the School Autonomous Rule Law, rendering educational establishments exempt from all common law, save their own agreed upon rules. Now, you can carry this law with you.%%%%For any educational or occupational establishment you officially associate with, you can choose to make them completely exempt from external laws and policing bodies. No matter how severe, you will never be punished for breaking the law within the confines of affected establishments, and unless they have means to enforce their own policies, you can’t be punished for ignoring those either, not to say that you can’t be fired or expelled if you refuse to do your work entirely.%%%%Nobody will find this strange.,,
Student Council - Mister President,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,It seems that this world is a bit different than the one you were supposed to arrive at. Namely, you’ve taken Doseigi’s place as Student Council President.%%%%You can even alter your history in future worlds, so you always hold some similar position of legal power.%%%%You’ve been blessed with an unnatural charisma to match.%%%%Those who benefit from your peace will never think to question you.%%%%You could talk students into killing their friends, and themselves, if you convinced them that it would protect this peace. You could implement unreasonable rules with equally cruel punishments, like making ignoring cleanup, running in the halls, unkempt clothes, coming to class late, and being a non-virgin punishable by death. A few weeks of propaganda is all it would take for the student body to accept these rules.%%%%Those who pledge themselves personally to your cause will disregard their own goals and sense of right and wrong to pursue your vision.%%%%Although, your charisma can’t get through to those who desire anarchy in itself, or who hold the law itself in disdain.,,
Bancho Group - Second Shield,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,When you’re fighting classmates to the death with supernatural powers, rather than well trained muscles, the idea of “personal strength” can become a bit muddled.%%%%As it stands, your own supernatural power will be valued in the same way as trained physical abilities. Even for those who would look down on relying on supernatural powers, you’ll always be treated as an exception.%%%%In general, you’ll never be discriminated against for using supernatural powers in place of physical strength or ability. It’s a different story if the way you use these powers gives people a valid reason to judge and ostracize you.,,
Bancho Group - Causeless Battle,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Believe it or not, the Banchou Group plays a very important and deliberate role in preserving the peace of the school. By clearly grooming themselves as the enemy of the school, they give the student body unity under a common enemy, and the Student Council's leadership.%%%%Now, in absolutely any conflict you find yourself involved in, you have the ability to paint yourself as the objective villain.%%%%As a result, the various factions will gain greater solidarity, possibly even uniting, all in the interest of opposing you. It might not to any favors to your self-esteem or life expectancy, but it’s a nice shortcut to peace.,,
Bancho Group - A Strong Boy,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,It’s said that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, but this is a bit much.%%%%By neglecting individual parts of your body, you are able to strengthen those parts to a frankly stupid extent. Live out three years in a wheelchair, then run a marathon in 30 minutes.%%%%The results are magnified if the form of your neglect is especially detrimental. For instance, if you spent those same three years holding your eyeballs in your hands, not only will your vision improve drastically, those eyeballs will be harder than diamonds once you’re done.%%%%When the nature of the neglect leaves improvement of that body part impossible, like receiving irreversible nerve damage to your arms, then your body will be improved in more general ways, like improving your situational awareness, reflexes, immune system, etc.,,
Bancho Group - I Love You As a Lez!,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Whether you spend your days studying for tests or fighting to the death, highschool is still highschool, and there’s nothing more difficult for hormonal teens than the search for love(and sex). You won’t have to worry about that.%%%%Not because you’re any more handsome or charming, but because now, regardless of your actions, your romantic relationships will never outright regress over time, unless you want them to.%%%%While this does mean that romantic relationships you form with people may very well last forever, this also assists with forging them to begin with. You don’t have to worry about potential partners getting sick of you, as you gradually chip away at their hearts through many minor acts of affection. While you can still make potential partners upset, or disgusted with you, those negative feelings can dissipate with time, while their underlying affection will remain.%%%%This also melts away potential romantic obstacles like gender, appearance, biology the like over time. Not to say they’ll actually go away, but potential partners always find it in themselves to overlook these things, if it’s for you.,,
Bancho Group - Living Human Treasure,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,If one thing can be said about the law enforcement of this world, they know when to quit while they’re ahead. You can take this spirit of compromise with you into future worlds.%%%%By repeatedly performing an otherwise illegal or unacceptable act over and over again while avoiding the consequences, eventually society will just give up, treating this as just an eccentric personality quirk, like cracking knuckles. This even applies if observers don’t recognize you.%%%%The time it takes for an act to become acceptable depends on the original severity. For instance, if you get away with murder for 60 years without facing legal repercussions, bystanders wouldn’t look twice if you kill someone in broad daylight and strike up friendly conversation without even wiping the blood off. People wouldn’t even bother avoiding you out of fear.%%%%The accumulated acceptability does carry between worlds, but you have to continue performing this act on a regular basis, or this effect will rapidly fade away.%%%%These actions only become acceptable for you, this isn’t a society-wide change.,,
Bancho Group - Desperation Tactics,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Whatever your gender is at a given time, be it male, female, or anything between or beyond, you’re pretty much the pinnacle of what people expect from it. Whatever positive traits are commonly associated with your gender, you possess them to a superhuman degree.%%%%As a man, you’re strong enough to throw cars, and you could navigate a boobytrapped maze blindfolded.%%%%As a female, you’re unreasonably cute, your empathy borders on mind reading, and your dexterous fingers could stitch someone’s mouth shut in seconds.%%%%What’s more, you can project intense pheromones that reek to members of the same gender, but are the next best thing to mind control for anyone else. Since this affects the instincts on a primal level, this can even pull people out of psychic attacks or illusions.,,
Bancho Group - Ultimate Bitch,,1,,-12000,,True,,True,,Every now and then, you find those exceptional geniuses who train themselves to superhumanity, without relying on Majin powers.%%%%Pick a single broad, clearly defined, and conventionally nonviolent skill set, like cooking, painting, or sex. In your lifetime, you’ve trained those skills up to a hypercompetent degree.%%%%These can now be applied to almost any situation, usually in ways that defy conventional physics or biology. Specializing in sex could let you seduce someone with a glance, or puppeteer bodies through your “massages”. Specializing in cooking might let you make food that drastically alters the eater’s biology, like healing wounds on the spot, or making heads explode from spiciness.%%%%Regardless of what you choose, you can now use this as a valid means of combat. Given their nature, these techniques bypass any defenses that specifically guard against “attacks”.,,Purchased 2 times. Poetry. Architecture.
Bancho Group - Hard Style Bancho,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Rather than the frightening Hiroshima Jyakennou, it seems that it was actually you who formed and leads the current Banchou Group.%%%%In future worlds, you’ll even be allowed to alter your history, to place you at the head of similar delinquent groups.%%%%Your physical abilities have been boosted to match your lifestyle. You can throw houses with one arm, dodge master sword strikes, and continue fighting with your skull split in half.%%%%Additionally, you gain the ability to project an aura of intimidation that makes you appear physically larger, proportional to how scared any observers are of you, averaging at elephant size.%%%%Despite being an illusion, this increases your intimidation factor to the point that even beings who know you can’t hurt them will still put their guards up reflexively.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Naked Gun,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,While keeping yourself looking sharp is an important part of earning your subordinates’ respect, it’s far more important that you carry yourself with dignity. Now, regardless of how you look, or what you’re wearing, people always take you just as seriously as you take yourself. You could just waltz around in public with spray-on pants, and as long as you act natural, nobody will have the guts to call you out on it.%%%%They’ll still think whatever they want, however.%%%%Still, it’s quite comforting to know that you don’t have to get dressed up, or dressed period, to have your troops to loyally follow you into battle.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Pointless War,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your platoon was called in to stir up shit between the Student Council and Banchou Group, and shit stirring is exactly what you’re going to do. You have a mastery over frame jobs. You can plant and hide evidence like it was second nature, and have it stick, even if that evidence makes no sense in the grand scheme of things. You’re great at shifting blame in general, if you claim that somebody of did something, or that you’re acting on their behalf, people will rarely doubt this unless you’ve given them a good reason not to trust you.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Cold and Wanting to be Cold,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Even when Majin powers are involved, do you really think a bunch of teenagers stand a chance against an experienced team of sensible adults?%%%%You can enforce a “type advantage” on those less mature than you, magnifying all of their immature aspects, and your own mature aspects.%%%%Hormonal teens become nigh-animalistic, and trivial for a composed adult like yourself to manipulate.%%%%This also makes the maturing process far kinder to you. You mature physically and mentally at an astounding rate, and you skip over the worst aspects of puberty entirely. You’d be a jaw-dropping beauty once you’ve reached your peak, if you had one, but you only seem to look better and better with age.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Unmutual Kill,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Whoever it was that said knowledge is power clearly had their head screwed on straight, because once you’ve won the information war, the physical one is just a pleasantry.%%%%As if guided by providence, the wider the knowledge gap between your team and your opponents, the easier it becomes for you to kill and avoid being killed by them.%%%%If your enemy was aware of your group, but not your motives or abilities, you could probably take on a small militia with a team half that size, with 30% casualties. However, if you took your opponents completely by surprise, without giving them any indication beforehand that a group like yours even existed, then you’d be able to take down at least a couple hundred Majins with only a few dozen broken ribs between your whole team.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Society’s Dogs,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Having the perfect plan or the perfect tools is all but worthless without the perfect team to pull it all together. When looking for new recruits possessing certain characteristics, people fitting all those criteria will somehow always crawl out of the woodworks to join your cause.%%%%The rarity of these criteria affects how quickly these people appear. Requesting a team of female Majins would probably take an afternoon, but looking for college-educated bisexual albino Majins would take at least a month.%%%%Naturally, you can’t ask for anything impossible, or something that wouldn’t exist in your current world.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Better Off Dead,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Do I really need to repeat myself? There are no happy endings for deadbeat Majins. Thankfully, even if they end up dying pointless deaths in the end, at least you can give them a chance to be of some use to society until then. You’re able to give the most discriminated against minorities and individuals, justified or otherwise, the chance to use their abilities for society’s sake. You could pull dangerous Majins right off the street and give them police badges, or pull a sadistic serial killer right out of his prison cell to save lives with his surgical talent.%%%%You can instantly absolve anyone of their past or potential offenses, form official organizations or teams on the fly, and gain society’s approval to let these dregs serve in these organizations with no questions asked, but only if all parties involved are sincerely interested in the betterment of society.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Majin Company,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You know what they say, good Majin help is hard to find, so why not skip the middleman and make some of your own.%%%%Regardless of what world you find them in, those who work alongside you in a clearly defined team structure will have a small chance of awakening as Majins. Their powers aren’t guaranteed to be strong, in fact, it’s incredibly unlikely, but their power will always be something that compliments your team dynamics.%%%%This is more or less common depending on how large the team is. With a team of up to 6, you could probably have every member awaken to their powers after two years, but with something like 20 members, only half would be able to awaken in 8 years.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Moe Moe Principle,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,I’m sure you’ve noticed the pattern by now, you’re taking the place of Mei Kurokawa/Reika Tsukuyomi as Principle of Kibousaki Academy and Second Lieutenant of the JSDF Majin Company. You can enter future worlds having either position already, or even both at once.%%%%You acquire the manipulation and management abilities to match your position. Forging and slipping into false identities is easier than breathing for you, and you have the competence to handle directing an entire military platoon, while managing a school as troublesome as this one.%%%%Your true talent lies in manipulation, you can dig into almost anyone’s head and mold their personality and actions like clay. You can bring bloodthirsty Majins down to Earth with your “sincere” smile, or plunge the calm and collected types into murdering their best friend after only a few brief interactions.%%%%You can quickly grasp the entirety of someone’s thought process with just a few meetings, allowing you to predict and plan around their actions and reactions, no matter how insignificant.%%%%Still, your plans are hardly immune to interference from unforeseen external factors.,,
Majin Power,,1,,6000,,True,,False,,Take 600 CP to determine the strengths and weaknesses of your power.%%%%You’ll be designing your power based on 5 parameters, with 5 tiers each, from F-A. Though, you’ll only be allowed to buy two parameters at A tier.%%%%All of the categories below are balanced in terms of how they impact the final power, so you can’t use your choices in other categories to justify you drastically contradicting or negating your limits in others.,,
Majin Power - Effect,,1,,00,,True,,True,,What your power actually does. Your power can have functionally any effect, no matter how strange or overpowered, as long as it aligns with the delusions you hold about the world and your purchases below. There are even cases where a Majin’s power encompases 2-3 effects, either interconnected, or completely unrelated.%%%%In those cases, your power’s parameters will account for your capabilities when using these in conjunction, barring cases where using just one would produce superior results.,,The power to apply or remove conceptual lables
Majin Power - Activation Condition:,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The conditions that need to be met to activate, prolong, control, or otherwise make any use of your power’s effects. Powers aren’t limited to one condition, so a power could require an especially complex condition to be met.Tiers are based on how the conditions collectively limit your ability to use the power.%%%%%%F Tier [Free] - Redundant:%%Conditions are hard to meet, and actively clash with the power’s main effect, drastically decreasing the power’s usefulness. E.g. the power to burn anything to a crisp requires that your target was already on fire for unrelated reasons, the power to instantly impregnate any girl requires them to be naked and willing, etc.%%%%D Tier [100] - Ritualistic:%%Your conditions are elaborate and inherently difficult to accomplish, but not in any way that notably clashes with the base effect. E.g. the power to create cursed swords requires you to forge them by hand, the power to observe other people requires you to paint a portrait of them beforehand, etc.%%%%C Tier [200] - Manageable:%%Conditions are still complex, and easily exploitable by an enemy even vaguely aware of this condition, but not inherently difficult to accomplish otherwise. This won’t stop your power from being functional under ideal conditions, but likely limits your strategic options severely. E.g. an invisibility power that requires you to stay immobile, an instant kill power that can only activate if you see the target break the law, etc.%%%%B Tier [300] - Intuitive:%%Conditions of this tier are not only easy to meet, but completely intuitive to the function of your power. The power to launch home runs requires you to swing with a baseball bat, the power to make people not suspect you requires you to do something otherwise suspicious, etc. That’s not to say your powers are impossible to stop. For instance, the former example may not trigger if you can’t complete a full swing, and the latter likely has an upper limit for how suspicious an action can be for this to have any effect.%%%%A Tier [400] - Instinctual:%%With this tier, the main thing needed to activate your power is the desire to do so. Whatever your condition is, it manifests completely within your mind. Maybe it’s triggered by feelings, maybe you need concentration to use it, maybe you just need to imagine your target, maybe your will alone is enough. Regardless, it’s almost impossible to stop your activation condition, short of outright mind control.,,
Majin Power - Functional Range,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The maximum range at which your power can be used effectively, even if your power has no strict range limits. For instance, if you have the power to stop time throughout the universe, your range will depend on how far away you could potentially travel to or influence within stopped time. Whether you have a short time limit, or some additional mobility power will drastically alter the functional range.%%%%%%F Tier [Free] - Touch:%%Power manifests close to your body, anything within melee range qualifies. Naturally, powers that only affect your own body, or powers that trigger on touch fall here.%%%%D Tier [100] - Duel:%%A power that can be readily used in a one on one fight, in terms of offensive abilities, at least. Powers that rely on line of sight and short-ranged projectiles usually fall under here. Your range is comparable to that of a mundane pistol.%%%%C Tier [200] - Battlefield:%%Powers that can be used effectively anywhere within an entire battlefield. The term “battlefield” is admittedly a bit vague, but if the previous tier is about the range that a professional soldier could use a pistol effectively, this is closer to a sniper rifle in the hands of a veteran assassin. Think something along the lines of a football stadium or a small island.%%%%B Tier [300] - Country:%%At this point, your power could easily reach an airplane at flight altitude above you. Your power could effectively be used across countries, excluding exceptionally large ones like the United States or Russia. Maybe France, but even that's stretching it. The firearms metaphors don’t even apply at this point, your range can only really be compared to low-end ICBMs.%%%%A Tier [400] - Global:%%As long as you and your target are on the same planet, then your power is still effective. It might even extend a little beyond that, but chances are anyone within your range that you’d want to use this power on is on the same planet, so it’s a bit of a moot point. Naturally the weaponry metaphor falls flat at this scale, but basically the only thing that could match your range of influence are truly apocalyptic or cosmic events.,,
Majin Power - Versatility,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,This category covers the variety of situations your power can be applied in, as well as how broadly defined its effect is. This is the difference between a power that can block any sword and a power that can block any attack. This also accounts for how far abilities can modify their own output, or possess multiple effects.%%%%%%F Tier [Free] - Rigid:%%Your power only serves a single specific purpose, in a single specific way. More than that, it’s only really useful under very specific circumstances. Like the power to flip someone’s wounds from one side of their body to the other, or the power to turn goldfish into piranhas. There is at least one potential situation where your power could be useful, but not many.%%%%D Tier [200] - Negociable:%%Your power still only fulfills a single type of task, but it can now be of use in a wider variety of situations or closely interrelated tasks. For instance, maybe instead of the power to turn males into females, you have the power to freely change genders in general. Or even if the power is still inflexible, you might just be able to use it in a wider range of situations. Maybe instead of needing car parts for the power to make motorcycles, you can just use broadly defined “trash”. Alternatively, your power may be able to boost itself in some way. Naturally it can’t be anything that would drastically alter the power’s effects past what this tier should allow. Temporary boosts to specific stats like destructive power or speed.%%%%C Tier [400] - Multipurpose:%%At this tier, your power can be applied, or possibly altered, for multiple distinct tasks, though it can’t stretch very far outside of those areas. For instance, the power to make your eyeballs fly around could be used for not only observation, but for combat, by using them as weapons, or even mobility, if you didn’t mind standing on them. Still, this power wouldn’t be capable of much else. This is where you’d see most multi-effect Majin powers showing up, such as the power to break skulls with a bamboo sword and short-range warping. Two specific abilities with limited application, but different enough from each other to qualify for this tier.%%%%B Tier [600] - Fluid:%%Rather than serving one or even several specific purposes, your power is so broad that it can be used to address a wide range of situations, and adapt to handle countless variations of those situations. Things like controlling a UFO that can not only be used for abductions, but may even be loaded with a number of alien gadgets for you to make use of. It’s also possible that your power is instead suited to a certain type of situation, but can be used on seemingly any variation of that type. For instance, the power to send your mind into cyberspace might let you control electronics in any way you could imagine, but barely anything in realspace.%%%%A Tier [800] - All in One:%%Your power is so flexible or broadly defined that it can be applied to handle any task that falls within a broadly defined category like “harm”, or “winning”, or maybe several less broad, but more diverse categories. For instance, a power that reflects attacks might cover verbal, mental, and even supernatural attacks, protecting the user from practically any harm. Maybe your power can create any mundane object you can imagine, allowing you to have the right tools for almost any problem. However, even at this tier, your power isn’t omnipotent, and still obvious blind spots. For instance, the former example may not have any method to deal with an enemy who can nonviolently imprison them, and the latter obviously would have no defenses against mental attacks and the like.,,
Majin Power - Potency,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,How powerful your base effect is. Your potency can either determine how inherently strong an effect is, or just the extent to which your power accomplishes a conceptually weak effect. Though, the usefulness or uniqueness generally has far more impact here than the sheer intensity of an effect. Powers don’t need to be combat-based to be considered “potent”, but combat examples are the most straightforward way to explain the different tiers. Whatever a power’s purpose is, this just determines how effectively it does it.%%%%%%F Tier [Free] - Pissant:%%At this point your power is all but useless. No matter how fantastical it may be on paper, it’s so unimpressive in practice that even those with no knowledge of the supernatural would be more ambivalently confused than amazed. Things like summoning prepackaged meat, or harlessly changing someone’s gender. Your power is inherently weak, and fulfils its purpose in a weak way. It’s sure to be convenient in some kind of circumstance or another, but even if your power was combat based, no one in their right mind would place you on the front line on the basis of your power. Uniqueness is irrelevant at this tier.%%%%D Tier [200] - Cannon Fodder:%%Your power is strong enough to be actually useful. Whatever the purpose of your power is, having it easily puts you above any normal human in that category, but mediocre at best among Majins with the same specialization. If your power only enhances your speed, than you can just barely reach mach speed. If your power enhanced your strength, you could crush solid concrete with your bare hands, and your punches could pulverize weak opponents. In any given battle, you’re likely to be a foot soldier, so to speak. Your power is valued enough for you to contribute, but still plain or weak enough for you to be totally expendable in the grand scheme of things.%%%%C Tier [400] - Key Player:%%Your power may not be the peak or anywhere near what Majin powers are truly capable of, but you’re still completely abnormal as far as most Majins are concerned. If you took part in a conflict, while your side’s battle plan would hardly collapse with you gone, it’d certainly be far more difficult. Many of your weaker allies may lose their nerves without you there to rely on. This is about the rank when you start to see abilities that affect other Majin powers in relatively unimpressive ways, like drawing supernatural attacks to yourself, or detecting the use of supernatural powers around you. If you’d rather just boost a weaker effect, than at this tier, your super strength could lift and throw buildings with ease, and super speed abilities are closer to teleportation than anything.%%%%B Tier [600] - Game Changer:%%Your power is potent enough that even other Majins may start treating you like a monster. Your power is the kind that can win small wars. So powerful or useful, either inherently or just in terms of scale, that entire battle plans are hinged around this power. Something that opponents will be forced to plan around. Think of projecting lethal viruses, resurrecting allies, teleporting entire groups, etc. This also includes stronger abilities that affect Majin powers, like being able to copy other powers (one at a time), or even weaker absolute effects, like the power to always attack before your enemy.%%%%A Tier [800] - Completely Broken:%%Your power is completely unfair, it wouldn’t even be appropriate to call it a force of nature. Forget winning a war, no enemy would be stupid enough to start one unless they believed this power was out of the picture. Potent conceptual/absolute powers fall under this tier, like inducing instant absolute death, or reflecting any broadly defined “attack” back on the originator, or even stealth abilities that render the user imperceptible and immune to any attack. There are few non-absolute powers that qualify for this tier, but some especially potent power manipulating abilities could make the cut. Like the power to increase the range of any Majin power, or the power to copy and keep multiple Majin powers at once.,,
Majin Power - Drawbacks,,1,,00,,False,,True,,This tier is completely optional, but by making your own power less convenient or outright harmful to use in obvious ways, you can gain additional CP to throw around. As such, unlike the previous categories, you can buy this at multiple tiers. Just be wary, drawbacks you take become features of the power itself, and will not be removed after leaving this world, but do continue to override perks and such. If your power somehow fits the criteria of one of the below categories in a way that is more beneficial than punishing, you can’t receive CP for it.%%%%%%F Tier [100] - Entrance Fee:%%You’re free to start hating your power at this tier, because now it’s designed such that using it requires you to inflict suffering on yourself to some significant degree. Many powers that are triggered by, self-injury fall here. If that’s too visceral for you, maybe your power requires you to do some repulsive task to use it, such as needing to eat something disgusting, or cover yourself in filth for one reason or another. This must be something that severely limits your ability to use your power freely and comfortably. If you’d rather not have to suffer up-front, you could instead make it so you continuously suffer to a far lesser extent. Powers that are always on, to your notable detriment, like a perpetual stealth ability, would qualify.%%%%D Tier [200] - Friendly Wager:%%Your power possess some attribute or limitation that puts you at great personal risk. This likely isn’t something inherently harmful on its own, but makes you far more susceptible to other forces that are. Maybe your power renders you immobile against your will, leaving you unable to defend yourself. Perhaps your power leaves you vulnerable to a particular type of damage, like a super speed ability that doesn’t protect you from high-speed impacts or collisions. This must be something that requires you to be significantly more cautious with the use of your power and places you at a very real risk to use.%%%%C Tier [300] - More Than Money:%%Beyond just being risky to use, using, or possibly just having this power directly places either you, allies around you, or both, in substantial danger, regardless of your desires. Something just as likely to hurt you as your opponents without cautious planning. For harmful automatic powers with this tier, chances are that you have so little conscious control over this power that it could easily activate on your allies. Something like an automatic power that inflicts your injuries on any friend or foe within a massive range of yourself, or a curse-like effect that triggers on anyone who betrays you, regardless of their reason. Whatever this is, it must severely limit your ability to use your power safely, and could easily harm you or your allies severely if used carelessly.%%%%B Tier [400] - Russian Roulette:%%At this tier, your power is not only dangerous, but it puts your own life at a very real risk, regardless of how hard to kill you would otherwise be. Either this power brings you closer and closer to death with each used, or like this tiers namesake, using this power poses a small and random chance of killing you outright. Maybe you need to sacrifice a significant portion of your life force to fuel it, bringing you closer to death every time you use it. A more direct example would be a power that would kills you if it’s fails to kill your opponent. Whatever your power does, it must place a very real risk of death for you when used. If not death, than some equally permanent death-equivalent, like petrification, or a permanent coma.%%%%A Tier [500] - DIE:%%With this, using, or just having this power severely and permanently decreases your ability to function as an independent lifeform, let alone a human being. Maybe your senses weaken every time you use it, to the point that you lose them all permanently. You can pay this price upfront, rather than a progressive or constant effect, but the effect will be appropriately more severe, like permanently degrading your intelligence to that of an infant in return for a subconscious power. In general, any drawback in this category are “fate worse than death” type effects. Alternatively, if you’d like to think of this as progression of the previous tier, you could change risk of death to guarantee of death, resulting in a power that requires the unavoidable death of the power’s user to even activate once. Something along those lines.,,
Transfer Student - Dressed to Distress,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,There’s no dress code for Transfer Students, but they’re still expected to make themselves presentable. Common practice is to wear your school uniform or working attire from when you first awakened as a Transfer Student.%%%%Even if you never did such a thing, you have an outfit on hand that you can wear into professional or educational setting without complaint.%%%%What’s more, this outfit is always supernaturally clean, all forms of grime and gore slide right off it.%%%%This doesn’t offer you much additional protection, but it can’t be damaged by anything that wasn’t already strong enough to injure you.,,
Transfer Student - Better Than Nothing,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A little something to help you make your way through all the strange locals you’ll find yourself in. Just by reaching into your pocket, you’ll be able to pull out a detailed map depicting the layout of whatever a qualifies as your “battlefield” for a given time. In this case, this will cover the entire island faculty of Kibousaki Academy, which is just about the largest area this can cover.%%%%Updating the map for a new area, or to reflect massive environmental changes is as simple as putting it back in your pocket. This also erases anything that might have been drawn on it, if you wish.,,
Transfer Student - Tools of the Tirade,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Just as a knife wielded by a Transfer Student could cut another Transfer Student, this blade wielded by you could cut... well, whatever you are.%%%%Using this knife will allow you to cut through any specific defenses that you happen to share. If you have a psychic barrier, this knife cuts through psychic barriers, if you have impenetrable muscles, this knife will cut through impenetrable muscles, etcetera, etcetera.%%%%Though, they have to be exactly the same, so having a psychic shield won’t let you cut magic ones.,,
Transfer Student - Friends in High Places,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,U.F.O. short for “Unidentified Flying Object”. You’d think they were just urban legends used to justify space funding and tax fraud, but they’re real, and they’re among us. You happen to be on pretty good terms with a few Greys yourself.%%%%They even loaned you one of their flying saucers. The aliens inside help you actually steer, but unless you have a telepathic link or something, you have to actually be inside to pilot the thing.%%%%This UFO is completely invisible, and traverses immense distances in barely any time. Anyone caught in the ship’s tractor beam can be rendered temporarily comatose, and you can even pick up and drop off people through solid matter. Though, abductions do leave easily identifiable crop circle patterns.%%%%Once you have someone on the ship, you can plant a probe in their brain. These probes will allow you to remotely monitor everything these people see or hear from the comfort of the UFO. Those are the highlights, but who knows what other cool alien gadgets you’ll dig up if you keep looking?,,
Student Council - False Image,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Can you really call this an item at this point? In any case, you have an unnatural shadow that you can control freely. You can make this appear anywhere on your body, in any size, shape, or density, regardless of the light levels around you. Still, other than that, it’s just a normal shadow with no other abnormal properties.%%%%This is mainly for dramatic effect, but creative use could see it acting as an oddly effective disguise.,,
Student Council - Information War,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,To assist you in your official duties, you’ve arranged a working relationship with a rather shady individual. Well, you assume they’re shady, but you’ve never met with them in person, and you never will, that’s just how good they are. You can contract them to infiltrate a group of your choice as a double agent.%%%%Over the course of their mission, they will feed you insider information from that faction, but they’ll rarely get their hands on anything truly top secret.%%%%Their observation period can be anywhere to a couple hours to ten years, but they’ll only agree to infiltrate one group per jump.,,
Student Council - Life Insurance,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Well, as the saying goes, it’s better to be safe than sorry, but then again, I think it’s better to be sorry (for your crippling poverty) than dead. A haughty Majin with a rather convenient power seems to have taken a liking to you.%%%%By contacting this ally through the proper channels, they can insure your person from various specific injuries like burns, cuts, explosions, broken bones, etc.%%%%When you suffer injuries of this nature, this power deducts money from your own reserves, and makes the injuries in question disappear, even if they should have, or already have, killed you.%%%%You must specify what injuries you’re insured against ahead of time, and you need to renew your contract when you exceed the amount of damage you’re insured against. Still, the power of money is not to be underestimated.,,
Student Council - The Red Demon’s Last Sword,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,At one time, at Kibousaki Academy, there existed a Majin swordsmith who would borrow the power to demons to forge supernaturally deadly swords. Overwhelmed with guilt over the suffering his blades had caused, he gave his life, body, and soul over to the demons to craft his final masterpiece, to be used by the Student Council to protect the peace. Evidently, he actually made two katanas in his last moments, and this one has made its way into your hands. Be careful to never scratch yourself on this sword. The blade is permeated by countless potent curses.%%%%The cutting power of this blade disregards any physical defenses. As long as the target is even remotely vulnerable to curses, this will cut through and kill them in the same instant the blade touches their body.,,
Banchou Group - A Love Letter?,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Er, well, not quite.This red envelope is to be used for invitations of all kinds, any occasion where you want someone to go to a certain place, or join you for a certain activity.%%%%When the intended recipient sets eyes on this, they will be overwhelmed by some emotion. What that emotion is will vary from person to person. In general, people will interpret the meaning of this letter in whatever way would make them most likely to accept your invitation. If the recipient was a coward, they might feel their life was at stake if they refuse. If they were particularly lonely, they might interpret the message as a love letter.%%%%Whatever gets them where you want them to be. Not impossible to refuse, but unlikely.,,
Banchou Group - A Special Piece,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Something irreplaceable, that special part or parts that makes a man a man, and a woman a woman, and yours now come off. This seems similar to Otome Ryuseiin’s Chinpai power, but unlike that power, you can takes these off and on as many times as you want.%%%%By attaching this to your chest, or between your legs, depending on your actual gender at the time, you can go through a 30 minute metamorphosis into the opposite gender.%%%%You can pull these off at any time to change back in an instant.%%%%Your appearance, and physical features will depend heavily on your own disposition and experiences.,,
Banchou Group - Biker Trash,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Among the Banchou Group, there’s a Majin with the power to turn garbage into Harley Davidson motorcycles. However, something strange happened when he made one for you.%%%%For some reason, this one motorcycle could turn back into garbage at your discretion, and you could even remake it by gathering enough random garbage, as if it was your power to begin with. You can even multiply this motorcycle with enough garbage, if you feel like riding with company.%%%%These motorcycles can run out of fuel or get damaged, but you can get rid of all that just by rebuilding it.%%%%You’re free to import other motorcycles you may possess to gain these properties.,,
Banchou Group - Majin ____ Club,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You’re now the president of your very own club for supernatural individuals. Fundamentally speaking, the subject of this club is something rather mundane, like kendo, baseball, art, etc.%%%%This club is special, in that it attracts those with supernatural abilities relating to the club. Even for the regular people who join, there is a small chance of them developing Majin powers relating to the club, though, it’s incredibly rare for notably potent abilities to develop this way.%%%%You can recreate this club in future school settings, and as fantastical as it may be, this club will never be disbanded or punished, unless it breaks any school rules outright.%%%%In the case of those who already had such powers, they will be compelled to find and join the club through sheer happenstance, but these people will not have the potential to develop Majin powers.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Fearsome Quick Shooting,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You’re a soldier on a mission, did you really think you’d be going into battle unarmed? A simple pistol, but that’s still one more pistol than any of these kids have on hand.%%%%Regardless of your attire, or lack thereof, you’re able to holster this gun seemingly nowhere. Just reaching your hand towards any observed place on your person will let you pull this out.%%%%Mind you, you only get one gun, you won’t be able to pull a second one out once you have it in hand.%%%%Ammo doesn’t instantly replenish either, but considering most guns wouldn’t regenerate ammo period, I don’t see what you have to complain about.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Obviously Fake Names,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sometimes an infiltration mission lasts a single day, other times, preparations must be made to allow for prolonged observation.%%%%You have an endless supply of fake identities with accompanying paperwork. These are thorough enough to fool even government agencies, but it’s advisable that you don’t push your luck and give them a reason to look for inconsistencies.%%%%Some of these are more convincing than others, and some might be beyond your capabilities to use, unless you have plenty of acting and improv skills to fall back on.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Sudden Procession,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,What... does this have to do with being a soldier? Why would you ever need this? Well, orders are orders.%%%%What you have here is a portable shrine, the kind you’d see at festivals and the like. It’s big enough for a couple dozen people to hold, and a few more to sit on. The also doesn’t seem to weigh any more or less, regardless of what you store in or on it.%%%%What you’d call this shrine’s special feature is that any power used by one of the people currently in contact with the shrine will extend to the shrine itself and any of the others touching it. Though, this only applies so long as they maintain contact with the shrine.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Don’t Want to Kill You Yet,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Acquired from an unknown source, Majin handcuffs are said to prevent escape by 90% of Majins. Well, it appears that these were made special, as these just happen to prevent 100% of Majin escapes.%%%%Locking these cuffs onto any Majin, supernatural, or superpowered individual's body will lock away all of their powers for as long as these stay on. Not even Transfer Students could break out of these.%%%%Not much else really needs to be said, though, if you’re worried about more mundane forms of breaking free, these are extremely durable in their own right, and are all but immune to lockpicking. So be careful not to lose the key.,,
Private Kibousaki Academy,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Here you will be able to purchase pieces of the Kibousaki Academy campus to take with you into future worlds. Coming from such a world, you can have the School Autonomous Rule Law apply to these properties, even in future worlds, unless you don’t want them to. You can buy more than one of these, but you can only take each facility once.,,
Transfer Student - Private Kibousaki Academy Old School Building,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A small academic building that has long since fallen into disuse and disrepair. In spite of that, this building is still fully stocked with teaching supplies. Some TLC would see this become a fully serviceable learning environment once more. This building tends to be rather unnoticable and out of the way from high-traffic areas, making it suitable for maintaining a low profile, or hiding from potential enemies.,,
Student Council - Private Kibousaki Academy Staff Building,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The base of operations for the Student Council. This building contains various offices for both the student council, teachers, and faculty alike to perform any and all duties that don’t involve teaching.%%%%Normally, this would be connected to the Main Building by suspended walkways, but unless you purchase both here, those are nowhere to be seen. Comfy, and well equipped for office work, but otherwise unremarkable.,,
Banchou Group - Private Kibousaki Academy Banchou Hut,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Banchou Group’s stomping ground. This was likely some from of waste disposal facility, on account of the hills of piled up garbage around here. Or maybe that’s just the ruins of buildings that have been destroyed in Majin battles in the past, as evident by the concrete, rebar, and girders jutting out of the ground.%%%%The smell isn’t great, but it’s secluded, spacious, and there’s no shortage of scrap metal to go around. You even have a working bathroom.,,
JSDF Majin Platoon - Private Kibousaki Academy Main Building,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The main academic building of Kibousaki Academy. This is where almost all the main classes and clubrooms lie, as well as the stage used for presentations, announcements, and executions.%%%%All of the classrooms are well equipped for their given subject, but that’s about all it’s good for.,,
Private Kibousaki Academy New Dream Island,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Rather than gaining any of the specific facilities, you now have possession of the island itself, with all the proper adjustments made to deal with the absence said facilities. Other than a fountain, various outdoor monuments, and the one bridge to land, there’s not much here.%%%%The island is 4 km in diameter, and a height of 200 m.%%%%Feel free to use all that space as you see fit.,,
Dangerous Harmageddon,,5,,00,,False,,True,,Requires all of Private Kibousaki Academy%%%%Your task is to somehow bring an end to the Harmageddon yourself. You have two paths to choose between in accomplishing this.%%%%Your first option is to deescalate the Harmageddon, letting it end without any factions being wiped out entirely, though a few casualties will be allowed. This is more than a little difficult, as the tension between the Student Council and Banchou Group runs deep, and the other factions have professional reasons not to allow this to end bloodlessly.%%%%If diplomacy breaks down, or you just don’t think this garbage is worth saving, your new goal is to ensure that your faction is the only one left alive. Not a single survivor from the other factions may remain, and you must survive as well, naturally.%%%%%%For completing the first task, the entirety of the Kibousaki Academy campus will take on an additional property from this world to carry onto future jumps.%%%%When you use this campus as an actual educational establishment, all staff and students will have a very small chance of awakening as Majins. The powers they develop naturally depends entirely on their personal delusions, making the whole process quite unpredictable.%%%%If you’d rather not risk potentially creating a Majin that ends the world, you can toggle this effect across the entire campus.%%%%%%If you instead decided to forgo peace, in favor of your faction’s supremacy, you receive the option to take any of the surviving members of your faction as companions for no cost. I’m sure you will have grown closer together through this experience, so you won’t have to worry about convincing them to come with you on your field trip through the multiverse.,,
The World of Transfer Students,,5,,00,,True,,False,,Requires the 1200 CP Version of Precedence%%%%Your mission here is twofold. Firstly, you must awaken to your power as a Transfer Student before this jump is over. Once you have completed the first task, your remaining condition is to continue doing Transfer Student work without ever failing a job once. This scenario is a bit peculiar, so it doesn’t matter how much of this jump is spent on the second task.%%%%%%You see, just for awakening as a Transfer Student, regardless of your original faction, Shiki house has decided to follow you into future worlds, even once you’ve completed your chain. They can be reached through a door to the Transfer Student World in your Warehouse, or closest equivalent.%%%%Although, they will never assist you outside of helping you complete your Transfer Student Work. They will recieve calls made from parallel worlds for your services, and they will take care of taking you to and from these worlds. Obviously, they can’t send you to other jumps this way until post-spark.%%%%%%Your missions will involve using your power to commit great acts of evil on behalf of your client. I mean, they don’t have to be evil, but considering you receive human sacrifices as payment, it’s pretty much expected to be something fucked up. You’ll also be expected to follow the Transfer Student rules on your missions, at least those related to contracts.%%%%%%In reality, the purpose of Transfer Student Work is to create your own world. Combining Manashiki Chihiro’s power to create universes, with Amarashiki Araka’s power to make structures, and the control over time and relationships supplied by Arayashiki Yuma and Sora’s powers, it is possible for any ideal paradise to be formed. However, sustaining a world requires inhabitants to observe it. This is why Transfer Students take Body parts as payment, by collecting pieces of people in this way, Chihiro is able to manifest them in your universe.%%%%You’ll be able to work on your own universe with Shiki House in your free time, and their missions will leave you with no shortage of inhabitants. However, though you can enter this universe at any time, you can not take anything out of it that you didn’t bring in. You’re not limited by the duration of this jump, or even this chain to continue working on it, however, if you ever fail your mission due to your own incompetence, Shiki House will take their leave. You’ll get to keep your universe, but without their help, you’re on your own in turning it into your perfect paradise.,,
New Challengers,,3,,-500,,False,,False,,If for some you desire to bring along any allies to experience this... confrontational world with you, than here is where you may impot companions from past jumps into new lives in this world. This option can also be taken to create entirely new companions, made to your specifications. All companions receive 800CP, as well as the stated 600 CP stipend for Majin power creation.,,
Choose Your Fighters,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,I never pegged you as the charitable type. Buying this will let you take a single character from this world as a companion. You’re free to take them along with or without their consent, but you’re guaranteed to start on good terms with this person.%%%%The first companion from your own faction will be discounted 50% off.,,
Battle Destruction School Dangerous 1969,,4,,00,,False,,False,,It seems that you’re going to be arriving long before the Harmageddon in 2010. Instead, you’re starting 41 years prior, during the riots headed by Doseigi Katsuya. These riots would eventually lead to the School Autonomous Rule Law, unless you interfere. You will enter this world as your factions closest equivalent in this conflict. Your time in this jump will end 31 years before the start of the Harmageddon.,,
Girly Hands,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,How unfortunate. A previous injury has left you with permanent nerve damage, robbing you of any and all grip strength you might have had. You can barely hold up a small school bag, and trying to swing around a melee weapon would send it flying out of your hands. Somehow, this also extends to unconventional means of gripping things, like using toes, tentacles, or telekinesis.%%%%Thankfully, you can still wear things like backpacks and clothing, as those things hold onto you through their own strength.,,
This is my Chuunibyou!,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Majin powers are a manifestation of the user’s delusions, but although their power may never change, most Majins do. You are not one of them. Your delusion dominates your life, you are hopelessly obsessed with not only indulging yourself in it, but forcing it onto others, always in a way that brings suffering.%%%%If your power is centered around your sense of justice, than you will attempt to destroy or subjugate any who disagree with it, and insist on using the cruelest punishments. If you have a power made for combat, than you may dedicate your life to making yourself as hated as possible, in order to attract strong opponents. No matter how tame your delusion should be, it will always manifest at a severity comparable to those examples.,,
Super Bitch’s Grandchild,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Oh dear, these are already starting to get awkward. Due to some tragic aspect of your upbringing, you have an unhealthy obsession with your own grandmother. You actively reject all attempts at friendship, romance, or any other kind of relationship with others, because you know that Granny’s the only one who will ever be good enough.%%%%You will be unable to sustain meaningful relationships during your time here, and I shudder to imagine how you would react if your precious Granny happened to pass away.,,
Unreasonable Power,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,It is natural for Majins to stick together, as they all know the pain of being feared and loathed, however, even Majins know a true monster when they see one, and will act appropriately. Whether for your power, or something you’ve done in your life, you are hated and feared by other Majins to the same extent that regular human treat Majins. They’ll avoid you, yet curse and conspire against you behind your back. Friendships are difficult for this reason. What’s more, it seems you just don’t have the willpower needed to bear that burden.%%%%Your tolerance for stress is pitiful. The kind of pressure you recieve on a daily basis is enough to make you puke, and you’ll likely end up taking some extreme and short sighted actions if you don’t have any pillars support to bring you back down to Earth.,,
You Abnormal!,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It appears that you weren’t spared from the worst aspects of the Majin condition after all. From here on out, you are completely robbed of all impulse control. You’re the type of person that would punch a Majin with the “kill anything that touches me” power.%%%%Without monumental willpower, you will constantly disregard the life and wellbeing of yourself and your allies with only the most infantile justification.%%%%Naturally, you need for immediate gratification has rendered your ability to plan for long term success nonexistent.,,
Only Two in The World,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You are sick and depraved, even by Majin standards. You have a fetish for your own death. More specifically, you get off on the idea of being killed by someone, and living on forever in their guilty conscience. You will put yourself in harms way for its own sake, and while you have enough sanity to stop yourself from going through with your delusions, that willpower may not hold if you’re too indulgent.%%%%You just feel bored and unsatisfied by anything that fails to kill you, and the only time you feel alive is when you’re standing at Death's door, or forcing some innocent soul to guide you there.,,
Transfer Papers,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,In the interest of professionalism, in order to enter a universe for a mission, there are a set of rules that Transfer Students must follow at all costs. Rules that will now be enforced on you. These all culminate in three core concepts.%%%%A Transfer Student cannot control their own strength, a Transfer Student can not lie or intentionally mislead, and a Transfer Student must obey any agreed upon contract, formal or otherwise, to the letter.%%%%This means that for the duration of your jump, you will be rendered wholly unable to restrain your physical abilities in combat. You also may not break any promises you make, or intentionally deceive, though, just withholding currently inconsequential information is fine.,,
A Maiden in Love,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Through some thoughtless act of affection in the past, you’ve caught the attention of the Majin Desuko Uramizaki. She’s a sweet girl, who just wants to be accepted by her one true prince. She just has a nasty habit of setting her standards way too high. She was making progress before, but now she’s latched onto you, and is more unstable than ever. She’ll interpret any occasion where you put the needs of someone else over her own, regardless of context, as betrayal.%%%%Her power will let her know when you do something she’d see as a “betrayal” and activate automatically. If you can’t avoid her Suicide-bliminal, then you’ll be forced to perceive her image and voice at all times, draining your sanity and compelling you to commit suicide.%%%%Suicide-bliminal will only cut off at the end of the jump.,,
“Peace” Granted by Majins,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You’re not a Majin at all, in fact, you’re a completely normal human. You’ve been raised to loathe Majins with every fiber of your being. Just looking at one makes you furious enough to puke.%%%%Taking this bars you from any General Perks, or accessing the Majin Power section entirely.%%%%Even your supernatural powers from other jumps are gone, so all you have to rely on are your wits and endless spite.,,
Blind Idiot Problems,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Somehow, your actions have infuriated Chihiro, effectively the God of this world. You’ll make enemies constantly, and given her distaste for you, Chihiro will awaken almost every single one of these foes with the power of a Transfer Student, just to make you suffer.%%%%You can not take these enemies as companions.,,
Imajinative,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,When a Majin awakens to their power, there are two things that happen: one, they receive instinctual knowledge of their ability and what it can do, and two, they’re possessed by the urge to use that power.This world seems to have affected you in an unexpected way. Your powers from other jumps now need to go through the same process, and all of them are individually sealed away until you do. This happens in response to stimuli related to the power, like a solar power requiring you to get sunburnt, or a power based on fire awakening near a campfire. You can’t stop powers from awakening, but eventually you may build up a resistance to the compulsions. If taken with, “Peace” Granted by Majins, rather than having your powers sealed away, your memories and personality traits will be sealed instead, needing to be unlocked before you can be the same you as before.,,
World War Dangerous,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You were asked to pick a faction at the start, but evidently you chose poorly, as all other factions now receive a serious boost in their capabilities, while yours stays just as weak as before.%%%%%%The Transfer Students will arrive in a party of five, rather than just three. Transfer Students are overpowered enough as is, so that’s more than enough to even the odds.%%%%The Student Council will have the full weight of the school rules on their side. Meaning that Doseigi can kill you the moment he catches you or your comrades in his line of sight. Not to mention, their improved information network had tipped them off to the presence of two additional factions, other than the Banchou Group.%%%%The Banchou Group’s Kotoba Kusetsuin is actually still alive. Her Perfection of Lies renders her nearly invincible in combat. What’s more, with their newfound composure, they’ve finally discovered the Student Council spy among them, allowing them to strategize in secrecy. They may be idiots, but they’re more than a match for the Student Council in terms of the number of powerful Majins on their side.%%%%The JSDF Majin Platoon is now arriving with double the number of regular human soldiers, and they’ve decided to take precautions by planting landmines and tripwires all around the campus. Evidently, they aren’t as worried about subtlety.,,
An Unspecial Existence,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,If Transfer Students are those with more priority than anyone else, than you are one who had the least priority out of anyone in the multiverse. Not only do your powers always lose in conflicts of perception, you seem to have an inverse of the strength that Transfer Students gain.%%%%Absolutely any violent physical force will carve through your body without any resistance, and even your strongest attacks will brush right off even the most fragile matter, as if all of reality were blessed with the unlimited offense and defense of a Transfer Student.%%%%Thankfully, the same exceptions still apply, so you can still interact with the world in non-violent or non-physical ways.,,
No Guarantee For Your Life,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,It’s commonly said that there is no limit to what kind of Majin powers can develope, but this feels like an exceptional case in spite of that. This odd Majin-to-be stumbled upon your secret and thought to themself “I could kill the Jumper” and thus, that delusion became reality, and they awakened as a Majin with the power and need to kill you.%%%%Given the nature of this ability, they’re conceptually immune to all your attempts to attack, defend against, or escape from them using your supernatural powers.%%%%No matter what you do, their power will close any gap in ability between you two created when you use your powers. Their power ensures that they will always keep up when competing with your abilities, even if they don’t possess those same abilities otherwise. You can shake them off your trail for a time, but they’ll always find you again soon enough.%%%%Your goal is just to stay alive until the end of the jump.,,
