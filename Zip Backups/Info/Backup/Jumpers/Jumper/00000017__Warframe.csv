Time and Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You may freely choose a starting time and place.%%%%Time:%%First Awakenings%%The Origin System shakes as the Lotus awakens the Tenno to a new and strange Origin System. Ancient warriors join the fray, and things will never be the same.%%%%The Second Dream%%Some time has passed since the first Tenno have awakened, and are now discovering their true selves. This time also marks the return of the Sentients to the Origin System’s stage, with Hunhow awakening from his tomb.%%%%The War Within%%The Grineer Empire has been dealt a great blow. The Elder Queen of the Grineer has perished at the hands of the Tenno, and the whispers of an entity beyond time and space has reached the solar system.%%%%The Sacrifice%%The Lotus has turned her back on her children. Rumours of new, disturbing creatures from the gas cities of Jupiter have begun surfacing...%%%%The New War%%The Sentients have truly returned. A great armada attacks the Origin System, assaulting every major celestial body in Sol.%%%%%%Location%%Mercury%%A planet by and large dominated by the Grineer. Fleets of galleons patrol its rich asteroid belts, contesting the occasional Infested outbreaks.%%%%Venus%%Venus is not the blistering wasteland that it once was, countless millennia ago. The remnants of Orokin terraforming technology have turned this uninhabitable hellscape into a survivable, if frigid and inhospitable land. Corpus teams and work camps teem close to the derelict terraformers, where scientists and labourers alike work to turn this planet habitable again.%%%%Earth%%Nature has once again overtaken Earth. Immense forests and biomes cover the cradle of humanity, with pockets of Infestation and Grineer outposts dotting the landscape. In a certain place, the remains of a mighty Sentient lay scattered, towering as high as mountains. At night, the mindless pieces of its corpse walk once again. Guarding this grave is the prophetic Unum, whom divines future timelines for the safety of the Ostron people in her shadow%%%%Mars%%Once the home of the sand people, the Grineer now dominate this place. The remnants of residences and ruins carved into the cliffs and ravines of the Martian deserts are the sole reminders of a rich culture and history, now lost to Grineer brutality.%%%%Phobos%%While the Grineer hold dominance over the Martian deserts, the orbit of Mars is hotly contested, as this small moon can attest to. Corpus Obelisks and Grineer Galleons fight over the orbital, with neither side willing to cede the moon to the other.%%%%Ceres%%This dwarf planet is a rusting and toxic example of Grineer negligence. A major industrial centre, the surface is covered in shipyards and forges. Everything from the mighty Formorians to the stalwart Galleons are manufactured in this toxic wasteland, where acid incessantly falls from the sky and lethal toxins flow in rivers.%%%%Jupiter%%Residence of the mad scientist Alad V, Jupiter is a research and industrial centre rivalled by few other Corpus territories. Enormous floating cities sit in the gas giant’s atmosphere, mining the rich core of Jupiter for valuable resources. These cities often hide research of sinister nature, from the Warframe experiments, to the Mutalist Infested, and most recently the horrific Amalgam chimeras.%%%%Europa%%This icy moon of Jupiter has been hotly contested in modern conflicts. The crashed remains of Corpus Obelisks tower in the landscape, where salvage crews toil for profit. Tunnels run through the surface like anthills, funneling scrap and supplies to treacherous wreckages. Perhaps you might find the ruins of an ancient city here, where a gluttonous legend took place.%%%%Saturn%%The rocky rings of Saturn are controlled by the Grineer, who mine the great asteroids within for resources to fuel their war machine.%%%%Uranus%%The oceanic floor of Uranus houses many Grineer research and cloning facilities. Lead by the gifted scientist Tyl Regor, teams of scholars and troops maintain the buildings under the crushing pressure of Uranus’s ocean. Yet even in such inhospitable places life still hangs on. Shark-like predators prowl the deepest caves and the sea floor, where strange corals grow and thrive. In an obscure cave lies the broken half-corpse of the Sentient Hunhow. Be careful where you tread, traveller.%%%%Neptune%%This gas giant stands as a testament to Corpus mastery over automated industry. Great factories churn out uncounted millions of proxies every day in its orbit.%%%%Eris%%Eris is unlike any other celestial body in the solar system. Once a rich trading outpost, the dwarf planet has since been overrun by Infestation. Great swathes of infested matter cover the hellish surface, as derelict and overgrown ships drift aimlessly in orbit.%%%%Pluto%%Automated Corpus industry and scientific research is spread across the frigid surface of Pluto. Cutting edge prototypes and legions of proxies patrol the the dwarf planet, accompanied by the occasional crewmen in sealed environmental suits.%%%%Sedna%%Ever at the frontier of exploration and expansion, the Grineer have established a major outpost on the very edges of the Solar System, deep within the Oort Cloud. Sedna plays host to the arenas of Rathuum, where Grineer criminals undergo trial by combat, cheered on by the bloodthirsty crowds.,,
Grineer,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Grineer are as brutal as they are proficient in war. Millennia of clone rot have not done them well, as many troops and workers replace their deteriorating bodies with cloned organs or crude cybernetics.,,
Corpus,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Corpus follow the word and creed of Profit. To them, Profit is itself a fundamental force of the universe, to be venerated and chased after with utmost devotion. Pioneering scientists and indoctrinated workers fill the ranks of the corporations, where entrepreneuring businesses compete in cutthroat politics and... Profit.,,
Tenno,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The ancient guardians of the Orokin, these warriors have awakened to an unfamiliar Origin System, where the once slaves rule a brutal empire, and merchant cults ruthlessly exploit others. The Tenno have lost so, so much, but there is much that can be regained.,,
Infested,,0,,00,,True,,False,,The Infested have been a problem plaguing the system since well before the Old War. A techno-organic virus that infects both organic and inorganic matter, the hive mind seeks to assimilate all into its embrace.,,
Music of the Void,,1,,00,,True,,True,,There is a certain flow in this universe. Whether it’s the transcendent beauty of that hellscape between dimensions, or the sprightly plains of Earth, a kind of music accompanies them. You can, at will, listen to the tones and notes that accompany these places.,,
Fighting Skills,,1,,00,,True,,True,,This universe has rather rampant lethality. Soldiers and civilians alike die in droves and masses, so it should come as little surprise that most travellers know how to defend themselves. You have the skills to roughly be on par with a Syndicate operative, able to wield most conventional ranged and melee weapons with some finesse.,,
Below Notice,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,It isn’t very safe to draw attention in this place. Where the Grineer hammer down a nail sticking out, the Corpus ruthlessly exploit. You are below all the major players’ notice, and will continue to be so unless you perform something beyond noteworthy. In future jumps, this perk is in effect until you perform an action that cannot be ignored by major powers.,,
Waste Not Want Not,,1,,1000,,True,,True,,Not a single thing goes to waste in this system. Everyone recycles, whether it’s waste or scrap. You have a talent for collecting such seemingly useless materials, whether they be organic waste, blasted scrap metal or broken fabric, and turning them into somewhat useful if crude devices. You are also good at improvising and jury rigging technology to work with substandard resources.,,
Void Touched Demon,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Free for Tenno%%Free for Old Blood%%%%Required for Ability Section%%%%Void exposure is not kind to many. This eldritch realm twists and changes those who stay inside. Many are driven insane by voices and hallucinations, some more real than imagined. But there are those who come back, with strange abilities and powers. Whether you are a survivor of the Zariman 10-0 or a Kuva Lich resurrected by the sorceries of the Old Blood, you wield the reality warping abilities of this realm.,,
Rail Agent,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,There’s money to be made and a reputation to forge for the bold. Independent agents roam the Solar Rails for business and adventure as Rail agents. Whether it’s intrigue, retrieving intel or espionage and infiltration, you have considerable skills in those areas. You can sneak into and out of Orokin Derelicts with nary a scratch where dozens of soldiers never return, infiltrate heavily guarded bases and hack their security systems with none the wiser, and are skilled enough in close combat to take your opponent’s weapon out of their holster before they can even react.,,
Riven Artistry,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Like a certain Cephalon, you have a talent in crafting custom Mods. These little modules make use of Void energy and Endo to create wondrous effects. An ordinary firearm using the right mods could rapidly corrode through metal or fire multiple projectiles in one shot without any change to the gun itself. Your expertise is such that you can freely create such modules and combine their effects in ways matched only by a select few.,,
Rare Aquisitions,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Like a certain Void trader, you have a talent for acquiring rare and valuable treasures. Whether it’s a priceless weapon or long-forgotten artifact, you have the skills to find and take it. You have a much easier time hunting for valuable objects; as long as you set your mind to it, you can recover nearly any treasure.,,
Unum's Foresight,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Quills share the unique ability of the Unum to look and view events through time.%%%%You also possess a measure of this ability, able to see likely possible futures in the short term, over a period of a few months. While this ability cannot see into long term outcomes, it can help you infer the possibilities in that time frame from extrapolation.,,
Weave Access,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Like the Cephalons, you too can access this sea of knowledge and information. With it, comes great processing and multitasking capabilities. You can create advanced simulations and datascapes like the Simulacrum and Sanctuary, and have the multitasking ability to run multiple such simulations at the same time.%%%%You can freely divide your attention among cognitive tasks without loss in performance, and accelerate your thought processes to be able to count nanoseconds as if they were seconds. You are also able to manifest an alternate reality of information connected to material reality in the form of such datascapes, with which you can put non-digital entities in.%%%%In future jumps your mind can access and wander freely across open information networks.,,
Grineer - The Rot of Cloning,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,It is not unusual for Grineer clones to need to have their failing organs replaced with extensive cybernetics. You, however, are different. You are a relatively healthy clone, needing far fewer, if any cybernetic replacements and your health does not degrade over time like other Grineer. You are also not subject to the short lifespans that most Grineer suffer from, due to genetic damage done by reckless use of Orokin-derived cloning technology.%%%%In future jumps you will be a very healthy example of any race you may be, being less affected by their weaknesses and having greater longevity.,,
Grineer - Ghoul,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Grineer are relentless and uncountable. None among the Grineer embody this better than the ghouls, disposable shock troops incubated on site to drown the opposition in numbers. For all that the Ghouls suffer horrendous deformities, they are animated by a drive that allows them to shrug off pain and injury without fear.%%%%You too can similarly do this, for even mortal wounds will not phase you unless they are immediately fatal.,,
Grineer - Crude and Tough,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,While Grineer technology is ugly and primitive compared to their rivals, they are undoubtedly effective, rugged and easily produced. The latter is true for creations of your craft.%%%%Anything you make is both durable and tough, able to take a beating and function in the harshest of environments while being viable for mass production.,,
Grineer - Greater than Flesh,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Grineer elite often make use of custom cybernetics to enhance their capabilities. The most heavily augmented troops and officers are head and shoulders above the rank and file in combat capability, able to fight off hordes of Infested where their fellow troops failed and survive the insides of Orokin derelicts with little injury. Any cybernetics you augment yourself with is more effective, and with less need for maintenance and no risk of rejection.,,
Grineer - Witch's Cauldron,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The forbidden sorceries and sciences utilising the substance known as Kuva are at your command. Whether it’s the creation of immortals or manipulation of the mind, your mastery of the sorcery surrounding Kuva are only matched by the Twin Queens themselves. As a bonus, you can passively generate Kuva at a rate of five vials a day.,,
Grineer - Maker of Tubes,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,With the ongoing deterioration of Grineer genetic stock, countless researchers have devoted themselves to genetic and biological sciences. The likes of Dr Tengus and Tyl Regor are among the most well known names within the Grineer scientific community for their work, and you can now count yourself as their peers in the same areas. You have immense skill in working with biology and genetics, with great expertise in other areas such as psychology, behavioural science and cybernetics; everything to ensure that the new generations of clones are fully functional, if not healthy.,,
Grineer - The Old Blood,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You are Queen-chosen, Jumper. The very leaders of the Grineer have shared with you the power of Kuva, of the Old Blood. You have been remade with sorcery and ancient sciences, and strengthened such that you can match a Warframe blow for blow while also wielding their powers. You are immortal, and resurrect from fatal injuries, up to and including disintegration. There are still ways to kill you permanently, of course. Your soul does not have such protections, and the Parazons the Tenno wield can end you with the right Requiem poem. Nonetheless, you are a force to be feared, and few outside the Tenno have the means to truly end you.,,
Corpus - Basic Robotics,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,With scientific advancement and innovation being a mainstay of Corpus culture, many within the corporations have at least basic expertise in designing and creating robots, from the high executives to the lowly crewmen. You know the basics of robotics in this universe, and can design and create relatively simple machines with animal level intelligence.,,
Corpus - Business Sense,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,What’s a good Corpus without a sense for Profit? You are a competent businessman, able to run a small corporation competently and with little trouble. You can manage finances, transactions, funds and investment without much effort, and have the potential to develop your business skills further more quickly.,,
Corpus - Grofit,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Growth... Profit... Grofit! Or that’s what you want your buyers to think. You have a certain knack for deception and negotiation, being able to fool skeptical customers with but a few minutes of conversation. Unless your lies and half truths have glaring contradictions, you can fool even a veteran’s eye. Just make sure that if your product does fail, your customer doesn’t live long enough to report it.,,
Corpus - Light Repercussions,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Corpus... aren’t known for their foresight. Many an executive has shot themselves in the foot in pursuit of short term profit. Greed makes you sloppy, as a rail agent said. Whatever you do, any unintended negative consequences of your actions will be reduced to somewhat manageable levels.,,
Corpus - Worthy Successor,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The Corpus are among the most innovative people of Origin, with its scientists having great successes in reverse engineering both Orokin and Sentient technology. You are the same, with great gifts in reverse engineering both familiar and unfamiliar technology. What may take others years to puzzle out you can do so in a few months or even weeks. You are also very creative with anything you reverse engineer, applying what you’ve learned to other, unrelated fields.,,
Corpus - V,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You possess a certain genius when merging different areas of science and technology. Whether it’s a marriage between Corpus robotics and Infested biology, or the merging of organic beings with Sentient technology, you have an expertise few can match. You can combine different paths of research and study into something greater than the sum of its parts, with the strengths of both and the weaknesses of neither, like the monstrous Amalgams or the Mutalist Infested. This perk also grants knowledge and skills relating to advanced robotics, biology, programming and artificial intelligence from this setting.,,
Corpus - Amalgam,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Grants access to Ability Section%%%%There is something to be said for Alad V’s experiments. For all that the man is incredibly dangerous to himself and everyone around him, none can deny that his creations are extremely potent; the most recent of which are the Amalgams, Corpus-Sentient hybrids. You have received an upgrade of sorts from this project. You are far more durable, as what may once have punched through your skin now harmlessly bounces off, and you are less vulnerable to ailments and debilitative conditions.,,
Tenno - Transference,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Transference and the Tenno are intimately linked. The Tenno mastery of this process is second to none, with their ability to wield the Warframes as if they are their own body. Whenever you use Transference on something, or have your mind/soul housed in another body, there will never be any sense of dysphoria and the body will feel natural to you.,,
Tenno - War Within,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The Tenno, without their Warframes, had learnt abilities inherent to them as Void-touched beings. You too possess the same abilities. You can now rapidly teleport short distances and enter the Void to avoid damage and detection. For offense, you can mold Void energy into a concentrated beam of energy, or to fire it in concussive blasts that do damage. This perk grants full mastery of those powers, as if you were a Tenno who has mastered their use.,,
Tenno - Focus,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,During their years under the Orokin Empire, the Tenno developed various schools of thought and philosophy. These schools of thought shaped the abilities that Tenno could learn, from the offensive abilities of Madurai, to the supportive roles of Vazarin.%%%%Even without their Warframes, a Tenno can learn to utilise everything from force fields, electricity, physical enhancement, regeneration and healing, to rudimentary temporal and gravity manipulation, to name a few. You have those same abilities, shaping the raw Void to your will.%%%%These powers can also help to enhance the inherent abilities you have as a Void touched being. This perk grants full mastery of two focus schools of your choice, with good proficiency in the other three.,,
Tenno - Cast in Steel and in Fury,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Tenno are masters of all aspects of warfare. Be it in ranged or melee combat with nearly any weapon, in electronic warfare and hacking or in command of a force. You can fight competently in any terrain, whether it’s in the zero and microgravity environments of space, under the immense pressures of oceans or in the jungles and deserts of rocky planets. You are able to hack most terminals and electronic devices, with only exceptionally strong countermeasures in those fields being able to repel you.%%%%Infiltration is also within your area of expertise, being able to sneak into heavily guarded data vaults and steal information from under your foes noses. You are also competent as a tactical leader, able to lead the crew of a ship with skill and finesse.,,
Tenno - Take Away their Pain,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,When the first Warframes were converted from living people, they were uncontrollable. In pain and rage, they were little more than berserkers needing to be restrained. But once the Tenno came along... that changed. The relationship the Warframes held with them was symbiosis, a merging of will, and not control. The Tenno took away the pain that they suffered, and in return, the Warframe became one with the Tenno. You have a near supernatural ability to discern the emotional and mental pain that others suffer through, and have a much easier time to ease such ailments, or to help them move on. Being there for someone will ease their mental burdens and calm them down if they’re distraught.,,
Tenno - Suffer Not,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The Tenno were able to kill the Orokin... and make them stay dead. With a system filled with various means of immortality, you are very good at making sure a fallen foe stays down. Anything that can die will stay dead once you kill them, as any means of regeneration and/or resurrection will fail on the thing you killed.,,
Tenno - Unchained,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Up until recently, a single Tenno has kept the voice of the Indifference from reaching his kin’s minds. Ravaged by the Void for millennia, he has kept his vigil until his mind had finally splintered. That won’t be your fate. Your mind is steel and your will is unbreakable. Your mind will not be damaged and destroyed by others, and will persist through all that would ravage it. You can survive the destruction of your body, and can physically manifest yourself over vast distances, such as throughout the whole Origin System. Mundane weapons and non supernatural means of attack pass harmlessly through you, unable to affect your new existence.,,
Infested - Untold Resiliance,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The Infested are nothing if not resilient to the extremes of the universe. As an Infested morph, you no longer age, have no need to breathe or eat and can survive in extreme environments like  hard vacuum or the freezing temperatures of Pluto without protection.,,
Infested - The Gift,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Being a Technocyte being is a blessing, not a curse. The weaknesses and failings of mundane biology no longer burden those gifted, and those synthetic find themselves with new purpose. As with any and all Infestation, you too can spread those gifts to others.%%%%You can also mold how those gifts manifest in others, allowing others to be gifted with you have, toned down version or just the basic gifts. You can spread any of your biology related abilities, traits and powers to both organic and synthetic beings, and have them linked to your mind as well. Anyone infected can be controlled by you.,,
Infested - Emissary,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,While not known for it, the Infestation can also do subtlety. Arlo and his cult were proof that they too can infiltrate and influence others. You can freely hide your Infested nature from detection from both organic senses and artificial sensors, appearing as relatively normal. You can also forgo such pretenses and reveal the full glory of the gifts of Technocyte, baring the gifts that the Hive Mind has given you. In future jumps, you can hide any traits that could mark you as a member of your species or race, such as being a heavily augmented cyborg, or an inhuman monster.,,
Infested - Undying,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Some infested are known to be nigh-immortal. The undying fliers exemplify this most, being able to literally regenerate from being reduced to mincemeat. You too possess this potent regeneration, but be warned; should you lose too much mass, you may not be able to regenerate at all.,,
Infested - Prelate,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Arlo’s cult are among the most successful ventures for the Infestation to date. With countless followers throwing themselves to the Infestation, a new figure has been created: the Zealoid Prelate. Wielding abilities not unlike those of the Tenno, the Prelate is a prophet of the Infestation, bringing the word of Arlo with fire and blood. As a Prelate, you are far tougher, able to shrug off ordinance that would vapourise ordinary Infested, and have a number of abilities. You can drain and consume other infested to heal yourself, and can teleport short distances. Your immense durability however, can be weakened when in proximity to Arlo’s Flame, and be rendered as vulnerable as lesser Infested morphs.,,
Infested - Lephantis,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Many of the more developed Infested morphs became what they currently are through feeding and consuming others. Like them, you too can grow from the same methods. By consuming other organic and/or synthetic matter, you can grow in physical capability and if you will it, in size as well. For every being you consume, you grow faster, more agile, stronger and tougher. While consuming organic mass equivalent to a normal human may only grant a small increase in those attributes, something with greater size and/or power could grant you greater increases. You can also gain biologically based abilities and traits through this method.,,
Infested - Helminth Consumption,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,The Warframes themselves are of your brood, even if the demons that control them are not. After all, it was the Helminth that granted its holders such immense physical prowess. You are of the Helminth strain, and are a Warframe in all but name. You can wield the strange powers that those devil controlled kin possess, and have the same physical capabilities; fast enough to be a blur at close range and deflect massed automatic gunfire, strong enough to lift and throw around objects weighing several tonnes, and durable enough to shrug off vehicle-rending explosions.,,
Fasion,,2,,00,,True,,True,,Nothing quite makes a statement as the cosmetics in this universe. Whether it’s the banners and remains of your fallen foes, flaming cloaks and garments or trails of energy you can be sure that you can look fabulous. You receive a whole set of your faction’s cosmetics for free, though you can also buy other factions’ fashion. You will also receive a wide variety of colour palettes to use, in case you want to tweak your armour.,,
Weapon Cache,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have received a cache of standard issue and upgraded weapons from your faction. For Grineer, this means you have a full armoury of standard issue Grineer weapons, alongside a few Wraith and Kuva variants of your choice. For Corpus, you’ll receive the standard issues alongside Vandal variants. For Tenno, you’ll have the usual Tenno arms alongside Prime gear. For Infested, you’ll have a full kit of weapons affected by Technocyte. You can purchase this more times for other factions’ weapons.,,
Fabrication Foundry,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,This table sized device is as versatile as it is expensive. It can manufacture everything from construction components, machine parts, weapons electronic systems and everything in between so long as you have the materials and blueprints. It can also process supernatural and exotic material in its manufacturing.,,
Personal Ship,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,Free for Tenno%%Free for Capstone%%%%Everyone needs a place to live and a means of transportation. You have what can be described as a relatively modest, non-combat medium vessel to reside in. For Tenno these will be an Orbiter with a landing craft, while for Grineer this will be an unarmed Crew Ship with a Firbolg. As a Corpus you will have your faction’s equivalent of the examples above. As Infested, you can choose an infected version of any faction’s medium vessel to reside in. All ships come with storage space, an armoury, small foundry and resting quarters.,,
Grineer - Spare Rations,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Admittedly, Grineer cuisine is sorely lacking. This is why you’ve been given some more palatable food in the form of nutritious and tasty Kuva ‘dumplings’. It’s not much, but it’s better than all the other stuff Grineer eat. This food replenishes once every day.,,
Grineer - Ghoul Bags,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Vay Hek, while being treated as a joke for much of his life, still had his moments of genius. In return for a small donation to his political campaign, he has sent you a modest supply of ghoul diapause bags. You have two hundred ghoul bags at your disposal, to be dropped wherever your enemies may be. The ghouls grown from these bags won’t live for more than a few weeks in most cases and have an average lifespan of a few minutes in combat, but they are useful for storming enemy defences and combatants. Your supply replenishes once every two weeks.,,
Grineer - Tusk Thumper,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have in your hands a Tusk Thumper. These tanks are both heavily armoured, fast, and incredibly agile, able to climb steep hills and leap dozens of metres into the air.%%%%The one you have is of the Doma variant, more heavily armed with cannons on two of its sides.,,
Grineer - Kurva Extraction Plants,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,All of that delicious Kuva is up for the taking. You have a dozen Kuva Siphons, each able make whole tanks worth of Kuva per extraction. Plenty for anything you really need.,,
Grineer - Arena,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,You have received a planetoid hosting several arenas, similar to the ones used for Rathuum. Whether they are used for training or gruesome blood games are up to you, for you are now the ruler of this place.,,
Grineer - Grineer Flagship,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Your very own Grineer capital ship. This is a Grineer Galleon, made to your preferences and specifications and outfitted with the best equipment to spare. As a bonus, it is crewed by elite Nightwatch troops (or Steel Meridian, if you’re not Grineer). A fitting ship for any enterprising commander. Regenerates or respawns by itself after a month if damaged or destroyed.,,
Grineer - Balor Fomorian,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,The Fomorians are among the most deadly ships in the Origin System, able to destroy small battlegroups of capital ships on their own. Each possesses immense firepower and durability, taking and shrugging off shots from even the venerable Corpus Obelisks. This is one such ship, and while not as personalised as a flagship, it more than makes up in sheer power and robustness. Regenerates or respawns by itself after a month if damaged or destroyed.,,
Corpus - Osprey,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Osprey It’s common for the Corpus to make use of robotic servants and assistants in their day to day tasks. You have an Osprey which has very little intelligence of its own. It can perform numerous tasks, such as carrying objects for you, assist you in combat or perform maintenance and repairs on other machines. It’s controlled by your thoughts, though it can also perform certain physical tasks independently of you.,,
Corpus - Coildrive,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,One of the main forms of Corpus terrestrial transportation, the Coildrive is both fast and able to navigate treacherous terrain, It’s lightly armoured, but more than makes up for it in its speed and agility.,,
Corpus - Eximus Suit,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Some crewmen distinguish themselves in battle, and thus receive upgraded equipment. Among those upgrades are the Eximus suits. You possess a powerful Eximus suit, fitted with bubble shield generators, slowing and shock auras and a more powerful exoskeleton.,,
Corpus - Proxy Production Plant,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Corpus are well known for their usage of proxies. You own one medium sized manufacturing plant, manufacturing everything from the humble MOA models to the venerable Bursas and fearsome Hyenas and Lynxes. This plant is housed in your warehouse.,,
Corpus - Animo,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,When the Animo Project was ended and its guiding intelligence destroyed, you managed to salvage its remains. Now, you have a somewhat lesser version of this evolving intelligence, housed in a refrigerator sized processing unit. This unit is a bit neutered, but it is fully under your command and controlled by you. You can use its capabilities for many things, be it formulating new strategies, research and development, or any number of cognition heavy activities. For any tasks it is applied to, it will become better at performing them over time as it develops and evolves.,,
Corpus - Corporation,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Corpus are first and foremost businessmen and women. You control a small to medium sized corporation; big enough to potentially have a name of some renown, but small enough to be left out of the byzantine politics of the Corpus Board. This corporation consists of several thousand members and about two dozen research and manufacturing facilities. You may decide what areas this corporation has major expertise in; e.g. robotics, biotech etc.,,
Corpus - Obelisk,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,Let it never be said that the Corpus spare expenses on their capital ships. You have a Corpus Obelisk, a mighty vessel multiple kilometres in length and armed to the teeth with weapons. This fearsome ship is crewed by battle-hardened crewmen and top-of-the-line proxies to protect against boarding. On board is a luxurious habitation suite for both you and the crew to enjoy, alongside manufacturing and research facilities, food production plants and a teleporter with a range of several thousand kilometres. Regenerates or respawns by itself after a month if damaged or destroyed.,,
Tenno - Warframe,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Tenno Only%%%%There’s not much to be said, but you have a blank slate of a Warframe. You can choose their abilities, backstory, appearance and if they are Umbra or not.,,
Tenno - Parazon,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The hidden blades of the Tenno are as versatile as they are deadly. These are not simply an assassin’s weapon, but a multitool for tasks such as hacking and grappling.,,
Tenno - Amp,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Amps are modular offensive foci used by the Tenno Operators to shape and mold Void energy into more damaging forms. The one you hold is a bit different, able to have its interchangeable parts swapped out and changed on the fly. It’s also able to mold and focus a wider range of energies, such as psychic powers, Ki, ect.,,
Tenno - Synthesis Sensor,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Tenno are among the most prolific hunters for the Sanctuary run by Cephalon Simaris. These scanners are very handy, being able to analyse structural composition, strengths and weaknesses, and also able to destructively upload matter and energy into data. Comes with its own simulated space you can add uploaded specimens to. The simulated space has unlimited storage.,,
Tenno - Paracesis,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Sentient slaying blade. This one works on more than just Sentients, however. It will strip away any damage adaptations a target may already have on contact, and will inflict greater wounds on anything that can adapt to damage done to it.,,
Tenno - Codex,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Codex is an encyclopedic database containing great amounts of information and knowledge. You have received one for yourself to use. This one contains information detailing everything from civilian technologies to basic military ones as well as instructions on how to build various terrestrial, underwater and space structures. This will update with all the civilian technologies each jump you go to. Has unlimited storage.,,
Tenno - Archwing,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,The humble archwing is the mainstay of Tenno space, aquatic and aerial infantry. Incredibly agile and able to teleport with numerous abilities of its own, the Archwing serves many roles in combat. You receive an archwing model of your choice.,,
Tenno - Resource Extractor,,2,,-4000,,False,,False,,When out of combat, Tenno sometimes send resource extraction drones deep into hostile territory to gather resources. You possess roughly four of these drones, each capable of holding a truck’s worth resources. These drones are hardly discrete, but given that extraction takes a few hours at most, you can be sure that it would be unlikely for you to lose your prize.,,
Tenno - Railjack,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Railjacks are among the Orokin’s finest ships. Designed to be able to operate without the fixed Solar Rails, they are built for mobility and versatility. From cloaking fields, teleportation recalls, ranged stasis fields, self repair capabilities and e-warfare suites, this ship is a force to be reckoned with. The ship here also comes with room for modification, and can be customised at your intent. Regenerates or respawns by itself after a month if damaged or destroyed.,,
Tenno - Dojo,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Tenno Dojos are places of residence, rest, meditation and training. These space stations house research and manufacturing facilities, residences and recreation and training rooms. A fit addition for any veteran Tenno and their clan. This version is also fully open to modifications, so modify it to your heart’s content. Regenerates or respawns by itself after a month if damaged or destroyed.,,
Infested - Biomass,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,You possess a dozen tonnes of Infested mass. This mass can be used for various functions, such as the crafting of various techno-organic devices or Infested morphs.,,
Infested - Arlo's Lantern,,2,,00,,False,,False,,,,
Infested - Strain Cultures,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,You possess samples from every known Infested strain, from the stock Technocyte to Helminth and Mutalist, alongside countless minor strains. They can be used to tinker or experiment, or used wholesale.,,
Infested - Plague Star,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,When enough Infested matter coalesces, it can form asteroids of Technocyte known as Plague Stars. These highly virulent meteors have been known to ruin both cities and habitats alike with their presence.%%%%You possess one such mass, which you may send out to where you wish. This mass regenerates once every three weeks.,,
Infested - Derelict Warship,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Overrun but functional, this Orokin Derelict warship is at your command. Its neural sentry has been subverted by the Infestation, and its various systems are still at full functionality. Unlike most other Derelicts that have been overgrown and torn apart by Infestation, the growths controlling this ship are carefully cultured to maintain its various systems while enhancing its already prodigious capabilities. Within this ship’s bridge unit is a throne from which you can control every part of the ship and its functions with your thoughts. Regenerates or respawns by itself after a month if damaged or destroyed.,,
Infested - Infested Habitat,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You own a small mobile space station that has been overtaken with Infestation. With a full suite of residences, entertainment venues, manufactorums and food production facilities, you’ll feel right at home. Regenerates and respawns after a month if damaged or destroyed.,,
Kavat / Kubrow,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have a tamed Kavat or Kubrow. It’s an impressive specimen of its species, being strong enough to rend a man limb from limb with ease and nimble enough to leap more than a dozen metres. A good friend to keep you company.,,
Hyena Jum3r,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,My, you must be wealthy, Jumper. This is a Hyena proxy, custom made for you. It doesn’t have much more intelligence than a particularly smart Kubrow or Kavat, but it is affectionate and loyal.,,
Aia,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,This Ostron woman is a free spirit. A tracker and hunter since she was a child, she knows the ins and outs of scavenging and living off the land. Daring and bold, Aia has a nose for valuables and a sense for danger.,,
Vay Marik,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Once a Grineer noble, Marik defected from the Grineer when her mutation was discovered. Marik possesses a genetic mutation allowing her to break free of the loyalty to the Queens engineered into all Grineer. Fiercely independent and of a dour demeanor, she is nonetheless compassionate.,,
Edam Vol,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,A mercenary and former Index Broker, Edam Vol has left his old career and contracts behind to become a mercenary for hire. Ruthless and with a mind for profit, he sees you as his partner in crime, having performed numerous operations together.,,
Leuvo,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Once a debt slave in Fortuna, Leuvo has been one of the few lucky enough to work off their debt. Now a Rail Agent, he searches for bounties to hunt and sells his service to independent colonies. He’s an adept fighter and quite knowledgeable in the workings of Corpus technology, with expertise in tinkering, maintaining and operating most forms of Corpus technology. Rather blase and with a dry sense of humour, Leuvo isn’t the easiest to work alongside, but there is something to be said for his determination and willingness to see through things with others.,,
Rulak,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,A Quill working for the Unum, he has foreseen that events would bend and break around you. Enigmatic and mysterious, he has not revealed his reasoning for befriending you. Nevertheless, he always tries to ensure your survival and victory. He tends to be comforting company to be around, despite his usual reserved attitude.,,
Cephalon,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Free if purchased Personal Ship%%%%It might get lonely out there, drifting in the endless black. Luckily, you have someone to keep you company. You have a cephalon installed on your personal ship or in a remote orbital. They are caring and while something of a mother hen, value your judgement and actions.,,
Lich,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,It seems that you have the companionship of one of the Queen’s chosen. If you’re a Tenno or otherwise not working with the Grineer, they might have been converted during a fateful showdown. If you are a Grineer, they might be a peer or a commander who has taken a liking to you. They are jovial and humorous, ever light hearted in even the most dreary situations. They seem to have taken after their Tenno progenitor a tad more than desirable, however; they’re a bit of a kleptomaniac, and like looting everything that isn’t nailed down and then the nails themselves.,,
Grandmaster,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,One of the Tenno has taken the task upon themselves to see to your survival. This is Grandmaster Arak of Clan Etzti. While you are not quite aware of who they are behind the Warframe unless you are another Tenno, they are rather protective of you. This Grandmaster is usually serious and reserved, but sometimes shows a joking and teasing side in more private moments.,,
Golem,,3,,-4000,,False,,True,,Quite a ship you have there, Jumper. This is one of the copies of the Jordas Golem roaming around Eris. He has avoided detection for some time, but has joined you in your journeys. Whether it’s through a fateful encounter or a shared history, he has decided to tag along with you. This copy is less schizophrenic than the others, having been been smoothly merged with the hive mind. He is cold and calculating, spending his days plotting the next course of infection, but will refrain at your word and takes your safety seriously.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,You may take a canon character as a Companion.,,
Abilities,,3,,10000,,True,,False,,Whether through the power of the Void or through arcane technology, strange powers are not uncommon here. Take 1000 Void Points to spend on abilities. You can convert CP into VP, but cannot do the same for VP. If you are a Tenno and have taken the custom Warframe, these abilities are for that Warframe. Otherwise these abilities are for you and you only.,,
Glorious Bloodshed,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Blood is something most living things possess, and what many other animate beings have an analogue to, such as hydraulics for synthetics or strange nanite concoctions in the case of Infested. You can manipulate blood, life force and its analogues to perform various abilities, such as healing yourself, damaging others with blood you’ve extracted, using it to reinvigorate yourself or weakening others to more easily rip it out of them.,,
Berserker,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Rage and bile are what fuel you. Your physical power is great, making you twice as fast and extremely agile, while also strong enough to tear vehicles to pieces with only one hand. Your roars stun and paralyse lesser enemies, and you can imbue your allies and yourself with greater speed and durability with your warcries. You can project riplines of energy to close the gap, sending enemies careening off their feet straight onto your blade. You can channel rage into devastating power; you grow claws formed of energy able to slice through metal as if it was wet tissue paper and blows that might have rent you in two now bounce harmlessly off you.,,
Healing Hands,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The ability to heal yourself and others on the fly is a welcome one. You are able to heal and invigorate others with your powers to an immense degree. You can drain your enemies of their life and stamina to heal/repair and invigorate allies and yourself, alongside replenishing their energy, both mundane and exotic. This healing isn’t restricted to just draining targets, either; you can also freely heal at a whim and also temporarily render allies and yourself more resistant to damage. The healing you can perform is potent, being able to take mortally wounded patients and render them to their peak condition. You can redirect physical damage you take into other targets, letting them take such blows in your stead.,,
Gunslinger,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Your aim is true and your shots shall never miss. You gain complete mastery of ranged weapons, particularly firearms, and have incredible aim; it is possible for you to snipe a target dozens of kilometres away if you can see them and land precise shots on rapidly moving targets doing their best to avoid you. Part of your powers is the ability to augment and supercharge your weapons, making them more powerful and damaging.%%%%Similarly, you can affect other weapons, jamming or causing those wielded by your enemies to misfire. You also are able to project an energy shield capable of reflecting attacks back your enemies. Lastly, you’ll receive a pair of summonable and desummonable pistols, augmented by your power. These pistols are pinpoint accurate and do not use ammunition, instead drawing on the Void to shoot bolts that ignore obstacles to reach your target.,,
Huntress,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The hunter knows to stay hidden and wait for the opportunity to strike. You have gained incredible tracking skills and awareness of your surroundings; so long as someone is no actively hiding their presence, you can sense their presence and location if they are nearby. You can cloak yourself to become invisible and also have a near supernatural ability for finding and taking treasure from others.%%%%As a part of your powers as a hunter/huntress, you receive a bow and quiver. This quiver holds specialised arrows formed from Void energy, which you can freely customise the function of, whether they put the enemy to sleep, emit noise or some other purpose. Your bow is rather special as well, punching through metres of steel with a single shot and able to shoot dozens of arrows at once, or a single arrow that explodes and destroys others in a wide area.,,
Blademaster,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The first of the Warframes had fairly basic powers as a proof of concept. While simple, the abilities of the original have their uses. You are immensely skilled with swords and other bladed weapons; every strike, swing and parry performed is artful, graceful and effective. You receive a sword formed of Void energy, able to be summoned and desummoned at will. This sword is supernaturally sharp, being able to cut through mundane material trivially, and can create flying blades of Void energy at will to do the same at range. To help you close the distance, your blade can also emit flashes of Void light that are able to blind enemies with or without eyes to see, and you can also summon ethereal copies of the blade to impale enemies at range.,,
Warrior of Glass,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,The original glass warrior was able to shape and create glass at will. Now, so can you. You can generate and shape extremely durable glass. The shapes this glass takes is up to your imagination, whether they be weapons, barriers, prisons, structures and everything in between. You can armour yourself in glass, or use orbiting shards of it to deflect and block projectiles, or create great barriers and structures to block artillery fire. Likewise, you can also use this glass offensively, confusing enemies with tricks of light and mirrors, imprison and immobilise them in molten glass or shred them to pieces with flying shards.,,
Engineer,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,You can freely create and produce small balls containing advanced technology from your being. These small balls can be summoned at will, and contain technology you possess the complete knowledge and working of. The starter set includes shock drones, explosive and shrapnel mines, weapon and movement enhancement drones, stasis/containment fields, gravitational vortexes and laser bombardment beacons.,,
Frostbite,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Cryomancy is a... chilling field to be a part of. I jest, but it is a potent power in the right hands. You manipulate cold and ice. You can form defensive structures with it, such as barriers or armour, or offensive ones such as spikes and heavy ice sheets. Your mastery over cold is such that you can flash freeze opponents and shatter them like glass, or slow the movement of everything in your surroundings through lowering their temperature and partially freezing them.,,
Gluttonous Desire,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Hunger is your domain. You have an insatiable appetite, able to consume nearly anything. You can consume mass equal to dozens of adult humans with little effort, and store them in your gut. The more you eat, the tougher you become, but the greater the drain on your stamina. You can also vomit up any undigested food at will, weaponising it as a projectile covered in toxic digestive fluids.%%%%Your gluttony does not simply serve yourself either. You can invigorate whole cities with your feasts, nourishing and making people stronger.,,
Monster of the Deep,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Legends hold that the depths of Earth’s oceans were home to great beasts and monsters. You are a powerful hydromancer, able to generate large amounts of water and manipulate it at will. You can freely shape water and use it to perform various tasks; holding and moving objects, raining down corrosive blasts of water or simply smacking things around.%%%%You can also transmute yourself into water, becoming shapeless and flowing/moving around at great speed through narrow or oddly shaped openings. Lastly, you hold a pocket dimension filled with water, home to a great beast that obeys you. You can pull others into this dimension with physical contact, or through a source of water.,,
Split Down a Line,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Day and night, the two opposing sides of the cycles of Earth. You gain an additional two variations of your form that you can switch between, exemplifying the difference between the two states. Your day form is bold and powerful, faster and stronger, capable of enhancing all of your prestigious supernatural abilities, and an aura that weakens those you target. At your will, you can freely damage and injure targets near you; dismembering and slicing them apart. Your night form is soft and defensive, more durable and with the ability to heal those near you, and with the power to will others to sleep.,,
Plague Queen,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Plague and poison constitute your kingdom of rot. You can create lethal and severe diseases, and manipulate how they affect and infect others. Your diseases have the potential to corrode through skin and metal, able to rapidly spread and infect synthetic and organic beings. The way your diseases are spread are at your control, whether propagating by themselves or through spores, or in a thick miasma that explodes around you.%%%%You can also channel poison into objects, be they weapons or tools, and also through other beings, augmenting them with a small measure of your power.,,
Playing with Mirrors,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Light has tricks of its own for you. You have powers related to light and shadows. You can create visual illusions, tangible holographic doppelgangers that mirror follow your movements and actions, lasers that cut through metal like tissue paper and shining jewels that shatter into blinding darkness when in shadow or into searing light in under, well, light. When you walk in darkness, you become harder to track and far more resistant to damage, and when you are under light, you find yourself stronger and what you wield charged with power. As a variation of the jewels you generate, you can also produce prisms that refract light into more intense forms, such as searing lasers or blinding blasts.,,
Warden of the Dead,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Just as the warden of the Eidolons were changed by their opponents, so have you. You can manipulate Sentient energy for a variety of uses, among them enthralling others to your will to transform them into slaves. The same energy can also be used to protect yourself, creating a shield that is able to redirect and reflect the power from attacks back at your attackers. You can also transmute yourself into this same energy, becoming intangible and thus unable to be harmed by most attacks. In this state you are also able to drain the life of others.%%%%Among the most potent things you can do with your Sentient energy is a devastating beam that rapidly adapts to the physical vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the target to damage them. You can also imbue your strikes with this same ability, taking advantage of your enemies’ weaknesses.,,
Riding the Lightning,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Electromancy is the power you have chosen. You can manipulate electricity in various ways. Be it a stream of high voltage lightning to electrocute and fry your foes or a bolt of intense plasma, your power has broad applications. You can form shields made of plasma able to repel and withstand immense amounts of force, or supercharge yourself with electricity to move fast enough to effortlessly outrun bullets.,,
Flying Tengu,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Aerokinesis is something of your specialty. You can generate and manipulate air, making it flow and blow in ways of your pleasing. You can use this air to propel yourself at great speed and fly, enhance your movement and generate pressure waves and bursts of air able to send targets careening away. You can generate extremely strong winds, enough to deflect bullets and high speed projectiles away from you, or create full size tornadoes that sweep in and cause devastating damage.,,
Speed Freak,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,One can be faster than a speeding bullet. That one is you. You can move at many dozens of times the speed of sound, and control kinetic energy within your surroundings. You could nullify the thermal or kinetic impact of projectiles or objects hitting you, and speed and heat up or freeze and slow down objects within your surroundings by manipulating their kinetic energy.%%%%You can augment yourself with this power as well, smashing through armoured bunkers face first with nary a dent, or overcharge your physical capabilities to even greater heights.,,
Living Blight,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Yours is an especially repulsive power; you can grow and manipulate Infestation. Your body is incredibly resilient, able to regenerate whole limbs within seconds and even able to revive from fatal wounds such as dismemberment and near disintegration. The latter requires you to have fed beforehand, either directly or through tendrils and spikes of Infestation that you can generate for that purpose. By consuming others, you can mutate, becoming tougher, regenerating faster and being stronger.%%%%Included in your mastery over Technocyte is the ability to generate Infestation ex-nihilo, creating whole groups of infested morphs, forming large and deadly spines and spikes, tendrils that grip and pull in objects, and even entire breeding grounds. You can also parasitise a target, redirecting any injuries you take onto them. The control of Infestation doesn’t extend to those that you haven’t grown yourself.,,
Necromancer,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are lord of the dead, Jumper. You have a terrifying aura, able to send weaker enemies into shock or flight, and intimidate your peers. Souls are a part of your domain, as you can contact and grasp them. Indeed, you can strike someone’s soul out of their body with a telekinetic punch, or force it back in to revive their soulless body. The dead are yours to command; you can decompose them into useful materials and ingredients, or raise them again as shadows to do your bidding. There is no limit to the number of shadows you can raise, so long as there are beings that have died in the last few hours at your location. Bear in mind, however, that they do degrade, and you may need to heal them periodically, which is something you can perform at will. These can also be called to your location at will, bypassing the distance needed to be by your side.,,
Titan of Stone,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are an exemplar of strength, and a geomancer of great power. You can manipulate and summon the earth at will, be it animating and shaping stone golems to do your bidding, protecting yourself in rocky armour, hurling great boulders and even turning other objects and people to stone.%%%%Stone and earth can be moulded like clay, forming arms or other appendages to manipulate other objects with, forming gigantic boulders or shaped into statues. Your physical strength is legendary, able to shatter a large asteroid into dust with a single mighty punch.,,
Monkey King,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You have powers based on the legend himself. You have learned supernatural techniques to cheat death entirely; three times a day, you can freely resurrect from dying. You are also able to shed a part of yourself to conjure a clone, with all of your abilities and skills, to operate independently of yourself.%%%%Among the other abilities you have that are based on the monkey king, you can take on a mist form that is all but invulnerable to most sources of damage and allows you to heal and recuperate, and further resistance to being injured or damaged. You also receive a size shifting staff that is able to shrink or expand at will, up to several dozens of metres in length. This staff is a manifestation of your abilities, able to be summoned and desummoned at will.,,
Deciever,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Deception and misdirection are your forte. You are a master at confusing and confounding others with your abilities. You can turn invisible and silence the sounds you make, and generate solid decoys of yourself. Similar to that ability, you can also create several shadow clones to do your bidding. Teleportation is trivial for you, being able to rapidly teleport short distances and even swap locations with your target. You can also easily disarm and confuse others, willing them to attack their allies in hysteria and drop their weapons.,,
Fae Monarch,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,The Faeries of myth are both mysterious and beautiful... and also terrifying and strange. You are the embodiment of this mercurial nature, able to injure and heal in equal measure. You can heal others at will, even periodically resurrecting those who you’ve imbued with your healing powers beforehand. But just as you can be generous, you can also be cruel.%%%%The souls of others are yours to play with, as you can rip it out of targets and consume them for their power and boons. You can smite your foes with bolts of energy and hallow your surroundings, weakening your foes and stripping them of physical defenses, while also purifying your allies and friends of ailments. You can also use this power to hold and manipulate people and objects from afar, gripping them and sending them flying or hurling into the ground.%%%%A softer touch is also in your favour if you so favour that approach; you can mesmerise others, and spellbind them, rendering them helpless as they flail around in the air. Finally, you can shrink in size into a flying pixy. Make no mistake, your physical attributes do not change and you can still easily perform great feats of strength if you so choose. You also receive a pair of size shifting pistols and a sword that could be used in that form.,,
Divine Fire,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,Few things hold more importance to humanity than fire. You are a pyromancer of great power, raining down fireballs on your enemies’ heads, impaling them on flaming spears or vaporising them in great waves of plasma. The same fire can also be used to protect you and others, repelling projectiles and boiling them to nothing, and cleansing and preventing debilitating conditions and ailments.%%%%Utilising a ring of flames, can also teleport and mark enemies for death, weakening them with your fire and burning their corpses into healing and invigorating orbs.,,
The Sound of Silence,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Hear that? Perhaps you didn’t. Sound and vibrations are yours to control. Among these abilities, is the power to generate and control shockwaves; you can generate shockwaves strong enough to send large cyborgs flying off their feet, or to destroy objects, to the point that you could easily collapse buildings with them. Alongside this you can also manipulate or shatter things with acoustic resonance.%%%%You are also able to use vibrations for sensory purposes, such as with echolocation. This manipulation of vibrations also allows you to deafen or even remove sound and vibrations from you and your surroundings, rendering yourself and/or the environment silent.,,
Mind Worm,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Psychic powers are your domain. You are capable of intricate and freeform mind manipulation, freely controlling other’s minds; editing and removing memories, changing their thoughts, controlling their emotions and outright mass mind control. This mind control can be resisted by particularly strong willed opponents, but those with weaker wills find their thoughts and memories molded at your whims.%%%%You are also capable of some level of telekinesis, able to lift, manipulate and throw around several tonnes of mass. Your psychic energy can also be shaped into other forms, such as bolts that injure and damage enemies or shields that can absorb the power of incoming attacks and send it back at the attackers.,,
Lord of Sands,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,The god king of Mars was a powerful being, able to conjure devastating sandstorms rising high into the sky. His powers are now yours to command. Through your sand, you can devour and consume the life of others, healing and even reviving yourself from death by draining other beings. You can also heal others with the life you’ve drained from targets.%%%%The beings you consume can be brought back as thralls made from cursed sand to do your bidding. You can generate and manipulate cursed sand, eating away at enemies, trapping them, using them to move objects and people and producing sandstorms large enough to rival small hurricanes in potency and power.,,
Mag,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Magnetism is a rather basic power, but one that holds great potency nonetheless. You control the power of magnetism, and with it, a sort of telekinesis. By using magnetism, you can move around objects at will, accelerate or slow them down among other things. Your magnetism is powerful enough to rip the armour off a vehicle’s chassis, redirect and reflect projectiles back at the enemy with greater force and crush hulking cyborgs into balls of meat and metal.%%%%Your magnetism doesn’t just apply to traditionally ferromagnetic objects, however; you can magnetise objects that hold no such properties, such as the bones of your foes.,,
Antimatter Demon,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You can manipulate and create one of the most destructive materials known to humanity. You can create antimatter at will, and perform immense acts of destruction with it. Among the feats you can accomplish, you can surround yourself with orbiting particles of antimatter, severely damaging surrounding enemies or destroying projectiles fired at you. You can also rig your enemies with antimatter in a wide range, making them far more vulnerable to damage and detonating them in great explosions.%%%%Obliterating enemies wholesale is also easily done, as you can send out masses of antimatter to detonate whole buildings and city blocks. Of course, sometimes you also want to watch the fireworks from a safe distance, and as such you can create short ranged wormholes.,,
Chromatic Elements,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Why settle for one element when you can go for more? You can create and control Fire, Ice, Toxins and Electricity. You can manipulate all four in a manner akin to the basic shaping and regulation of power that the previous relevant power options grant. You can enhance yourself and others with each of the four elements. With fire you can heal and invigorate, with ice you can increase durability and reflect back attacks, with toxin you can enhance speed and coordination/dexterity and with electricity you can supercharge electronics and redirect power to enemies.%%%%You grow in power and durability as you take damage; the more you are hit by attacks that can injure you the more your strength grows and the more durable you become.%%%%As an accompaniment to the above, you receive the skin/pelt of a creature you have killed. This pelt is extremely tough and serves as a decent armour by itself.,,
Thinking with Portals,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You have a curious relationship with time and space. You can freely phase outside the normal universe, appearing invisible to others and teleporting short ranges. You can draw motes of power from other dimensions, temporarily fueling and enhancing your physical attributes or granting minor abilities. You can also use these motes as beacons, allowing you to teleport to them at will.%%%%One of your most potent abilities, however, is your portal creation. You can create dimensional breaches, overwhelming enemies and disintegrating them with surges of energy. You can create portals over vast distances, such that you could open one end within the sun to annihilate targets with solar plasma, or within a black hole’s event horizon to shear targets apart.,,
Master of the RIft,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Between material reality and the Void lies a boundary realm known as the Rift. You are master of this realm, having control over time and space within it. Whether it’s teleporting, stopping time, or banishing things or even regions of realspace to and from this realm, you can do so as easily as snapping your fingers.%%%%With enough finesse, you could perhaps teleport across the solar system. Be sure not to screw up though, the last one to try that ended up in several pieces.,,
Nailed Down,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You want it. You want it all. Being the magpie you are, you might have a minor case of kleptomania. Anywhere in hostile territory you go, you will feel the urge to loot everything with even an ounce of value, no matter how impractical it may be. It’s resistable, but you will feel the urge at the back of your mind every time you go on a mission.,,
A Little Strange,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,You are slightly... off for your faction. Your allies find that you are not quite normal, and more than a little strange. You are slightly unsettling and off-putting to everyone, and while that may not majorly hinder your relationships, expect plenty of second glances from passers-by.,,Retail rocker
Ridiculous Outfit,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Some of the major figures have... interesting choices in their appearance. Whether it is Vay Hek’s yellow cybernetic turkey, Alad V’s shower curtain of a lab coat, or Nef Anyo’s outrageously tacky... thing, you aren’t immune either. Your signature outfit is both incredibly tacky and lacking in fashion sense, to the point you could outdo all three of them combined in sheer visual terrorism. You can be sure to drop jaws with your appearance in all the wrong ways.,,
Amazing Chest Ahead,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,There’s a problem. The Sentients seem to particularly want to annoy you. Just about anywhere outside of your faction’s territory, you’ll find some valuable objects that may or may not actually be Sentient Mimics. Watch where you put your hand, Jumper. Those Ayatan sculptures may not be what they seem to be.,,Retail rocker
Cowardly Marks,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It seems that notable figures have a way of cheating death. Just about every notable opponent you try to kill has the ability to escape their predicament.

Cataclysm,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,You have bred a Kavat... demon... thing. All you know is that it is both incredibly ugly and creepy beyond measure.

Nemesis,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You have gained an enemy, Jumper. You have your very own nemesis.

Corrupted Rifts,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,For whatever reason, Void rifts open around you at rather inconvenient times.
