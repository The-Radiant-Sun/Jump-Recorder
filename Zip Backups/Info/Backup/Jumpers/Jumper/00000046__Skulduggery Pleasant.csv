Universal Drawbacks,,6,,105000,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Location, Age and Gender,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Choose your starting location freely. If you want a guideline, or just want to leave it up to chance, here are some of your options:%%1 - Dublin, Ireland%%2 - Roarhaven, Ireland%%3 - London, England%%4 - Sydney, Australia%%5 - Berlin, Germany%%6 - Paris, France%%7 - New York, United States of America%%%%If you are a Drop In, your age is 14+1d8. For all other origins, add 100 years to that amount. Your gender is the same as it was in the previous Jump. You may freely select either for 50 CP.,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You arrive with no new memories to burden you, no past to define you. All you have are the clothes on your back and papers to prove you legally live in the place you show up.,,
Sanctuary Worker,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Congratulations, you work for the man. The normal 9-5 job; go to work, file some paperwork, maybe having a chance to talk to the skeleton detective, lunch, etc, etc, you get it. You start this life as a bottom rung worker. Whether you stay there or move up is all on you. You start with memories of your previous life, who you were is up to you.%%%%You will begin with a one bedroom apartment and some money in the bank.,,
Detective,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You weren’t happy with your former employment so you struck out on your own. Your a PI now, the guy/gal that never rests until they get their man (and get paid). Even though you no longer work for them, your former bosses (the Sanctuary) have seen fit to send a few cases your way, so don't worry about a lack of work.%%%%Who knows, you may even be a friend of the skeleton detective, or at least hate him less than most.,,
Villain,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Maybe you’re the kind of person who only cares about themselves? Or perhaps you’ve devoted yourself to those grand beings of the worlds beyond, who seek to rip this world asunder? Or maybe you’re just bored of this world, and want to paint it red with your bloodstained sensibilities? Whether you’re simply self-serving, a religious fanatic, or a bored psychopath, you’re not someone who’s generally considered good company.,,
Magic,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mandatory%%%%This world’s magic is not exactly what you normally come across. Here everyone (barring one) has a True Name.%%%%This name is the source of magic and what allows sorcerers to use magic. Learning someone else’s True Name will allow you to have absolute control over everything they do and vice versa if someone learns yours. The only way to prevent this is to seal your name. On the other hand, learning your own True Name allows a sorcerer to access godlike magic and power.%%%%You arrive here with the spark of magic inside you, allowing you to bring it to the surface and wield it as a weapon.%%%%Regardless of your chosen Origin, your ability to wield magic and the skill you possess is roughly equivalent to that of a local wielding the same discipline that has lived for about one hundred years.,,
Longevity,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mandatory%%%%In this world, magic has a sort of rejuvenating effect, decreasing the speed at which a sorcerer/ress ages. Sorcerers can live for hundreds of years, with some exemplary individuals managing to live for even a thousand.%%%%However, barring vampires, this is not immortality; a magic-user will still age and eventually die, with their magic simply slowing the process down.,,
Combat Training,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,One Purchase Free, 100 CP for multiple purchases%%%%This world isn’t like Harry Potter where fighting is always done at a distance and only with magic. Here, sorcerers use every advantage they have to fight, win, and survive. All origins receive training in a single form of combat equal to that of a master of said discipline. The definition of combat training is rather broad, and can cover anything from a specific martial art to swordsmanship to the use of firearms. Now before you get a big head, I should remind you that the majority of the main characters are masters of several martial arts, so do try to be careful. This perk may be purchased multiple times.,,
Multilingual,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,May be purchased multiple times%%%%Who doesn’t want to speak another language to know another culture? You won't meet a sorcerer who doesn’t know at least one extra language. It's part of their way to hide among the mortals to live among them to immerse themselves in the world. That, and the fact that after a few decades, people can get incredibly bored and start learning anything to keep themselves entertained. But let's go with the former, since it’s more dramatic.%%%%By purchasing this, you gain mastery in speaking, reading, and writing a language of your choice, as well as gaining in-depth knowledge of the culture your chosen language is local to. This perk may be purchased multiple times.,,
I'll be Fine,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The black stone that powers the Scepter of the Ancients was said to have sung to the Faceless Ones when their enemies approached, but when the Ancients took the stone, it remained silent. A long time later, Valkyrie Cain, thought to be a descendant of the Ancients, was able to touch the stone without it turning her to dust as it had to so many others. This is a gift you now possess.%%%%You are now able to touch materials that would indiscriminately kill others for touching it and passive magical detection systems can no longer detect you.,,
Beautiful Sorrows,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,The magic flowing through your body has made you very pretty, Jumper.%%%%So pretty, in fact, that one glimpse of you can literally enthrall the average person, regardless of sexual orientation or current relationship status. In fact, most people would be more than willing to give you everything they own and devote the rest of their life to serving you.%%%%The strong-willed and magically-resistant can resist this enthrallment, and those who are aware of the magical nature of your beauty can build up a tolerance over time, though even these people will still acknowledge your beauty.%%%%However, this comes with no ability to tone down your beauty, and any attempts to hide it will only ever be partially effective, so good luck going incognito when eyes are literally drawn to you, or having a meaningful conversation while people are drooling over you.%%%%After this Jump ends, you'll have control over this effect, and can even switch it off, if you want. You'll still be whiplash inducingly hot though.,,
Remnant,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,What a curious ability you’ve acquired, Jumper.%%%%You now have the power to turn into a Remnant, a small, shadowy spirit with narrow white eyes. While in this form, you can possess others by crawling down their throats.%%%%While possessing someone’s body, you can access their powers and memories as though they were your own. Your possession will have the same tell-tale signs of being possessed by a Remnant (black lips and veins under their skin), and the same methods of expelling you from your host will work, such as specific sigils and magic that manipulates or destroys souls.%%%%Unlike a normal Remnant, you will not become fused with your host after four continuous days of possession, allowing you to leave whenever you want.,,
Second Coming,,1,,2000,,True,,True,,Lord Vile to Necromancy, Mevolent to Elemental magic, China Sorrows to Signum Linguistics, you to your discipline. Every once in a while there comes a person that changes everything about what others thought about that discipline either through their great control or the abilities they manifested that no one knew existed. Now, you are one of them, whether your specialty is Elemental, Necromancy, Signum Linguistics, or one of the many other types of magic offered here.%%%%What this does is increase the speed at which you learn your discipline. What would normally take a sorcerer decades to create takes you mere months. Where one one sorcerer would take eleven months of constant torture in a barren dimension in order to advance and create new and improved moves, you can achieve similar results without trying in a year or five months with actual effort. (If you manage to get access to more than one magic this applies to them as well and you don’t have to buy it again).%%%%%%This acts as a Capstone Booster for 600 CP perks and the abilities in the Magic Section.%%%%It also grants the Jumper an additional 600 CP stipend for use in the Magic Section only.,,
Sealed True Name,,1,,-14000,,True,,True,,Somehow, you discovered your True Name, and, through a process that may or may not have involved temporarily killing yourself and carving a delicate series of runes into your own heart, you have sealed your True Name. This offers a number of considerable benefits.%%%%First of all, your name being sealed means it cannot be used against you, even if others know it.%%%%Second, it enhances your magic tremendously, affording you a considerable boost in both raw power and your growth rate. While this will not grant you access to an unlimited font of raw magical power until you attain your Spark, it will make it so your well of magical energy grows by leaps and bounds continuously, even without any training or effort on your part.%%%%This perk also grants you a notable healing factor, which scales in effectiveness as your overall magic capacity grows larger. With enough magical power, your body could heal itself from being shot in the head fast enough that the entry wound closes before the bullet exits the back of your skull.%%%%Even more impressive than this is your ability to copy any discipline of magic by seeing it in action only a single time, though it will take practice and time to build up a greater level of skill in wielding it.%%%%Learning your True Name has also given you access to the souls and consciousnesses of others, allowing you to manipulate and destroy them as you desire. This allows you to do things like tearing Remnants from their hosts, regardless of how long they have been fused.%%%%You can see the magic of others, and even cycle through their souls, seeing everything they have seen and learning everything they know before absorbing it for yourself, as Darquesse did to Argeddion in Dying Of The Light.,,
Drop In - Likeable,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Why do people like you so much?%%%%Regardless of how you act, how sarcastic, blunt or even brutal you are, people of all shapes and sizes seem to always like you, or at minimum have a favourable opinion of you.%%%%Of course, this isn’t permanent, and if you are too mean or just plainly treat them like dirt, they will abandon or betray you. So keep your friends close.,,
Drop In - Reflection,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Reflections are perfect copies on an individual created from a reflective surface. This is done by drawing a specific sigil onto the surface and stating a specific phrase.%%%%Normally this can only be used to create one Reflection for one individual, but as you paying CP for this, your version of this ability is unique. As long as you are in front of a reflective surface, you will be able to create clone after clone, and they each return to their mirror when their assigned task is completed, their memories transferring back to you.%%%%What’s more, you don’t need to worry about any of your Reflections becoming sentient and rebelling against you; all of your clones will be loyal to you and incapable of gaining independence. Do note that they do not possess your supernatural abilities or capacity for magic, only your knowledge and traits inherent to your biology. Reflections cannot make more Reflections.,,
Drop In - Prodigy,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Damn, what are you? With this perk, you have become a prodigy, able to learn various martial arts and other mundane skills terrifyingly quickly.%%%%You are now equal to Valkyrie Cain in terms of your learning rate, able to go from a total novice to being able to beat a room of fairly trained full grown men in less than a year.%%%%This applies to all skills that don’t have to do with magic (Consider this a mundane version of Second Coming in terms of growth rate boosts).,,
Drop In - Multidisciplinary Magic,,1,,00,,True,,True,,The majority of magic users in this world are limited to only one discipline whether to Elemental or other adept branches. However, there are others in this community who are ‘magically ambidextrous’, able to learn two different distinct disciplines, and now you are too.%%%%With this perk, you can now pick 2 disciplines in the magic section below, paying full price for the more expensive one and half price for the other.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Well look at that. Your sheer aptitude for magic has transcended the limits of magical ambidexterity to become magical ambidexterity. Instead of having to just pick two disciplines, you can pick any number you want. All purchases after your most expensive selection are discounted. You also gain an additional 600 CP for use in the Magic Section only.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Job Security,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,One thing you need to know about working in the Sanctuary is that a lot of people who do it end up dead. Chances are you will too, unless you take this perk.%%%%With it, you gain an increased chance of not getting killed on everyday assignments. This isn’t total invulnerability so much as it is a kind of luck that will help keep you alive by reducing the day-to-day risks of your employment, so long as you actually try to do your job well. Simply cowering and doing nothing will likely lead you to a quick death.%%%%As an added bonus, in the event of your employers meeting an untimely demise, their replacements will see fit to let you keep your job. The shady subordinates they bring in to replace the dead will be less likely to kill you during the inevitable power grab too.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Jumper Cleaver,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Through some special circumstances, you have undergone training in the Cleaver program, turning you into the perfect soldier.%%%%This training has augmented you with lower-tier superhuman physical abilities (strength, endurance, speed, balance, etc.) and affords you the skill to wield the Cleaver scythes with deadly skill. These blades are made of woven razor, making them absurdly sharp and strong, while also causing injuries that can never heal.%%%%For some reason or another, the mental conditioning part of the program didn’t stick, leaving you with your independence intact. So while you might not be an actual Cleaver, you’ve got all the pros and none of the cons, so who cares?%%%%This perk comes with your own woven razor scythe, which may be imported into an appropriate weapon if you so choose.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Grousing Gadgeeter,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Like Ghastly Bespoke, Kenspeckle Grouse, and Doctor Rote all rolled into one, you have immense talent when it comes to the creation of all varieties of enchanted or magical items.%%%%Whether it’s Ghastly’s protective clothing, woven razor Cleaver scythes, a magical prison like the Cube, Kenspeckle Grouse’s life-annihilating Desolation Engine, sentient magical machines like the Engineer, or even the magic-boosting Accelerator itself, you have the skills needed to create them.%%%%More powerful creations like the Cube and the Accelerator will certainly take more time, resources, and experimentation to fully develop, of course.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Elder,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You're not some low-level mage working the usual nine-to-five anymore. You worked and worked until you were recognized for your skill and elected to the position of Elder of your local Sanctuary.%%%%This gives you an incredible amount of political influence on the national scale, and quite a lot of pull on the international stage as well. Of course, all that influence wouldn’t do you much good without the skill to wield it properly, so you’ve also gained an unfathomable degree of competence in all fields relating to running a country of mages; politics, economics, resource distribution, the works.%%%%Not only that, but you have a special sense, passively informing you of the country’s needs.%%%%You’re also a fair bit stronger in terms of your magical power. This is less a benefit of raw power and more a case of your tremendous familiarity with your own powers.%%%%Your magic simply requires less effort to cast than it did before, with spells taxing your reserves far less than they would other practitioners of your discipline.%%%%Be warned though: Elders tend to die quite often around here. If you buy this perk with an Origin other than Sanctuary Worker, check the Notes section for suggestions on how it might work.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You aren’t just an Elder, you’re your country’s Grand Mage.%%%%This means you hold complete and uncontested control over your country’s government. You have a direct line to any of the country’s resources, and can requisition them for personal use with very few questions asked, if any at all.%%%%Your preternatural awareness of your country’s condition is heightened as well, acting as a kind of danger sense that warns you of acts against the nation as a whole, whether that might be foreign invasion, infiltration by spies, or a terrorist attack. Additionally, your magical skill is even greater than before.%%%%Where before you could cast a spell with half the effort it would take a lesser mage, now you can cast it with one twentieth the effort.%%%%In future Jumps, you may choose to gain a similarly high-ranking position of power in either your starting location or a location suitable to your race/origin.%%%%%%,,The political/leadership skills and magical efficiency remain constant across origins.%%%%The Villain origin has two easy options; the first is that you hold the same position of power as the Worker origin does, and people are unaware of your malign intentions. Alternatively, you could have your own shadow organization of considerable size based in your starting location. Either way, the danger sense remains the same, but more primed towards threats against your organization in particular, rather than the nation you're based in.%%%%Next, for Drop In, you could consider it to see you rapidly attain social influence among the masses of a given location (ostensibly your starting location) until you reach the point where you have a kind of unofficial network of informants and people who are willing to do stuff for you within your chosen area. The country-scale danger sense would apply to this area that you hold influence.%%%%Finally, for the Detective origin, I'd say the easiest way to go about this would be to scale up your personal detective work into either a country-wide PI service or a private military kind of deal.%%%%Either way, the danger sense would probably remain functionally similar to that of the Worker origin.
Detective - Doors are for people with No Imagination,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Doors are boring. All the bad guys expect you to go through them, and most of the time they totally disregard or forget the other methods of breaking and entering.%%%%With this perk, you will be able to easily find new and unconventional methods of entering residences, whether that means busting through a wall like the Kool-Aid Man, sneaking down the chimney Santa-style, or just smashing through a window.%%%%With this, you will always have a way to catch your enemies off guard.,,
Detective - No Pain No Gain,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,It’s weird how many times a private detective gets hit. I guess people just don’t like what you have to say. Whether it’s just a bar fight in Roarhaven or being tied up by your nemesis and tortured, it takes a lot to handle all of it.%%%%With this perk, your tolerance has increased greatly, enabling you to handle hours upon hours of torture at the hands of people like Serpine and barely feel anything.%%%%You could probably even endure months of periodic torture by the Faceless Ones and come out mostly sane.,,
Detective - Prime Detective,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,What’s a detective without actual detective skills?%%%%With this perk, you have gained the observational skills, cataloging, patience, and deductive reasoning of a pro detective equalling and even possibly outcompeting Sherlock Holmes himself.%%%%Regardless of how clean a crime scene is or how much magic was put into hiding the evidence, you’re always able to find something, some tiny scrap of evidence that can snowball into a deciding factor in closing the case.%%%%Regardless of what stands in your way, you will always end up getting your mark.,,
Detective - Skullduggery Pleasant,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Or close enough. Sorry to tell you this, but you died.%%%%Luckily for you, you seem to have decided death that wasn’t for you and come back to your body, which is now just a skeleton.%%%%This DOES come with some advantages; if your body is ever damaged, you can quite literally put yourself together. The only other person with this condition was even able to replace his head after it was stolen. So long as the majority of your body is left undamaged, you will be able to survive and keep on fighting. Just watch out for magic that disintegrates bone.%%%%Weirdly enough, even though you have no nervous system, you still feel pain. If you miss having your dangly, fleshy bits as a skeleton with the Skulduggery Pleasant perk, perhaps look into acquiring a skinsuit? A hollowed-out zombie of sufficient quality would probably do the trick.%%%%Post-Jump, you may apply this as a toggle for any and all of your alt-forms, freely switching to a skeletal variant of those forms. If this perk is taken with Colour-Coded Reaper, you may choose to either be a skeleton wearing a super-zombie as a skinsuit, or may choose to simply be a powerful zombie with a particularly sturdy skeleton that could continue to move and fight even if all that was left of them was bones.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Due to the enormity of your magical power, not just your body, but your very being has been augmented.%%%%If there ever comes a time when your entire body is destroyed, you can now survive as a being of pure energy (similar to Darquesse when she battles against the Faceless Ones) and can now either take on another form as your own or simply reconstruct your skeleton as it was prior to its destruction.%%%%However, don’t think this will render you invincible, as there are beings and weapons in this world and others that can hurt and even kill you regardless.,,
Villain - Un-Ravel-ing,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,What are the keys to a successful plan? Patience. Having the patience to wait until the time is right, when everyone’s back is turned, when no one can stop you. Deceptiveness. Being able to conceal your true intentions, to hide them behind a facade. And getting the right people to work for you. You have an innate talent for all of these things.%%%%You have the patience to wait centuries for the right moment to carry out your plan. You’re a skilled enough liar and actor to hide your true beliefs from your best friends for decades.%%%%And you have a knack for getting into people’s heads, twisting their beliefs to align with yours, turning them into dutiful supporters...or at least begrudging allies.%%%%To top all this off, you’re also better at making long-term plans, the kind that take years to come to fruition.,,
Villain - Truely Vile,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Lord Vile was the most feared of Mevolent’s Three Generals. Not only for his cruelty and capacity to commit murder without a second thought, but for his capacity to step onto a battlefield, alone, and emerge utterly victorious. You too have this strength.%%%%When facing a large number of opponents alone, your powers and abilities are enhanced. Anything and everything that could help you win the battle becomes stronger.%%%%This is not a perk that makes fighting one hundred enemies at once the same as fighting one hundred one-on-one battles. Rather, your power literally increases when you are fighting more enemies.%%%%This boost will fade as the death you bring reduces your foes’ numbers, but it will do so at a pace that will still leave you stronger than normal until your last enemy has fallen or fled.,,
Villain - Colour Coded Cleaver,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The White Cleaver, and later the Black Cleaver, were subjected to an advanced experimental form of Necromancy, transforming his body into a high-quality zombie possessing dramatic regenerative capabilities, to the point it was able to survive being ripped to pieces.%%%%It seems that you have endured a similar process, turning you into a zombie of equal caliber.%%%%Your strength and durability exceed those of normal Cleavers, such that you can hold off a squad of ordinary Cleavers by your lonesome.%%%%If taken with Cleaver Jumper, the boosts to your strength, durability, and stamina are increased by a factor of 50%, and you can change your background to include a history of service as a Cleaver if you so desire.,,
Villain - Lord Jumper's Armour,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You can infuse copies of your abilities into objects, turning them into focuses for those powers.%%%%Using these focuses in concert with the original power within your body will see your might with these abilities enhanced dramatically.%%%%Alternatively, you could loan these items to allies and subordinates to grant them access to these powers.%%%%Objects that you infuse with your power are also infused with your will. This allows them to act independently to enact your will, and enables them to refuse others the right to use the power they grant.%%%%You may only create one focus per power, and a given item can only contain one power at a time.%%%%When these items are destroyed, the power flows back into you, and you can create a new focus for it.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Your power has risen to new heights in a number of different ways.%%%%Firstly, you are capable of creating multiple focuses for the same ability with no loss in their overall power level, and using the same item as a focus for more than a single ability.%%%%The true strength of this ability, however, is that each and every one of your powers has become a semi-sentient being of its own, a kind of pseudo-consciousness based on your will attached to the ability.%%%%These consciousnesses are aligned with you in terms of morality and intent, and can add their force of will to yours.%%%%When you work in concert with them, your precision, control, and raw power output increase without any additional exertion on your part.%%%%Furthermore, in the event that you are incapacitated in some fashion, these consciousnesses can take control of your body, wielding the power they are attached to in order to protect your body until you return.%%%%Alternatively, you could grant your powers control of your body while you fully devote your mind to other tasks.%%%%Because of this boost, you may choose to make your focuses tangible avatars of your individual powers, turning them from semi-sentient objects to fully sapient ones.%%%%These conscious powers will not manifest as whispering voices in the back of your head unless you want them to.%%%%%%For the purposes of Lord Jumper’s Armor, a power is something roughly as broad as a given discipline of magic. To use an example, the Fireball Jutsu would not count as a power, but the ability to use Fire Release as a whole would.,,
Magic,,1,,2000,,True,,False,,All origins receive a 200 CP stipend to use in this section only. With the Capstone Booster, the magic you purchase is upgraded to an enhanced version, granting more power and versatility in addition to the original properties.%%%%You may only purchase one discipline unless you have bought the Multidisciplinary Magic perk. If you have purchased said perk without the capstone booster, the less-expensive of your two purchases is discounted. If you have the capstone-boosted version of Multidisciplinary Magic, all purchases past your most expensive one are discounted.%%%%Advanced Elemental does not require Multidisciplinary Magic to buy; you only need to purchase Elemental.%%%%Signum Linguistics may be purchased as a second discipline even without Multidisciplinary Magic.,,
Aborkineticism,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The ability to make plants grow faster by talking to them, though the plants you affect will only grow within the confines of what is natural for them.%%%%Expressly cannot be used for combat.,,
Aborkineticism + Second Coming - Chlorokinesis,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Through the power of your True Name, your magic has bloomed into something greater.%%%%Where before you could merely accelerate the growth of plants, now you may control them with your mind. Substituting magical energy for water, nutrients, sunlight, and time, you can force plants to grow to monstrous sizes, far surpassing what they would normally grow to, and make them move as an animal might.%%%%You could turn daffodils into tentacle-like vines, or make peach trees grow fruit the size of bowling balls.%%%%Unlike the less advanced version, this power can be used in battle.,,
Wall Walking,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Walk up walls, or on ceilings.%%%%Also allows the user to magically open locks, and to seal doors by touching them and saying “Withstand”.,,
Wall Walking + Second Coming - Air Walking,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Through the power of your True Name, you no longer need physical surfaces to stand on.%%%%You can now walk on the air itself, standing on open space with as little thought to the act as a normal person puts into walking on the sidewalk. You can, of course, stand on the air at any angle, affording yourself a tremendous degree of three-dimensional maneuverability.%%%%Per the magic’s name, this does require air to stand on; you wouldn’t be able to use this in the vacuum of space, for example, but the thin air of the upper atmosphere should be no problem.%%%%Of course, this magic doesn’t grant you the ability to breathe in such an environment for very long.%%%%Your ability to magically open locks has been enhanced as well, now encompassing even advanced electronic security like password-protected doors and biometric access locks. It only works on doors though; you can’t use it to hack into a computer.,,
Bonebreaker,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,A highly-specialized discipline, this branch of magic allows you to break a target’s bones by touching their body with your fingertips.%%%%Bones broken with this power shatter completely, causing serious damage to the surrounding tissues and organs. Using it on someone’s skull or ribs would almost certainly prove fatal, as the shards of bone would tear through the victim’s brain, heart, or lungs.%%%%However, only the bones surrounding the area touched will break. To shatter the skull, you must touch the head, while breaking a person’s ribs requires touching their chest.%%%%The power can only be transmitted through your fingertips, but even the briefest and gentlest of touches can get the job done.,,
Bonebreaker + Second Coming - Ranged Breaking,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Your mastery of this rare discipline has grown to the point where you can defy its only critical weakness, allowing you to use the power at range.%%%%You can now invisibly transmit your power from your fingertips in a straight line to strike targets at distances of up to ten meters.%%%%Each fingertip can fire a distinct instance of your power, allowing you to hit a single target in ten places at once...or ten different targets all at the same time.,,
Elemental,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,A fairly common powerset, this branch of magic allows you to manipulate the four classical elements in a limited fashion.%%%%You can create fire by generating friction, which can be used to conjure throwable fireballs. You can also manipulate existing flames.%%%%With air magic, you can use the displacement of the air around you to create powerful pressurized blasts capable of ripping through solid walls.%%%%Water can be used to control the atmospheric moisture in your immediate vicinity or manipulate existing bodies of water.%%%%Earth magic possesses only a single technique; turning the user into a nigh-indestructible statue. This self-petrification can last an indeterminate amount of time, ranging from minutes to centuries, with the user having no control over the duration.,,
Advanced Elemental,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Requires Elemental%%%%More advanced and diverse applications of the standard Elemental toolkit.%%%%Where before you could use fire magic to throw fireballs, now you can envelop your body in flames and throw streams of it like a flamethrower.%%%%Wind magic can be used to create whirlwinds, deprive people of their oxygen, and read disturbances in the air as a kind of sixth sense.%%%%Water magic can be used to casually walk on water and shape it into deadly weapons.%%%%Earth magic can now be used to manipulate the ground itself, causing tunnels to cave in, sensing underground objects by extending your mind into the earth, or even creating an imperfect version of the Tunneling magic.%%%%,,
Advanced Elemental + Second Coming - Melevolent,,1,,00,,True,,True,,With the capstone booster, your command of the Elemental magics is now on par with one of the greatest sorcerers of all time, enhancing both the precision and scale of your magic.%%%%Your command over fire is such that you can shape flames into plasma cutters, or command conflagrations that span entire towns.%%%%Your command over wind is such that you could take the air inside a person’s lungs and throat and use it to blow them up from the inside. You can also use the power of the wind to fly freely and indefinitely, moving at incredibly high speeds.%%%%Your mastery of water magic enables you to draw water from inside the bodies of living beings, desiccating them in an instant. You can also command the water within your body to enhance your physical strength and heal your wounds.%%%%And your mastery of earth magic grants you the ability to reshape the world around you on a whim, drawing small mountains out of the earth and using your mind to hurl horse-sized boulders with careless ease.,,
Children of the Spider,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Controlling spiders, turning into a giant spider the size of a car, and summoning swarms of spiders...by vomiting them up.%%%%Your wounds also bleed spiders instead of blood, giving you more ammunition the more injured you become.%%%%People generally don’t like or trust them, usually with good reason.,,
Children of the Spider + Second Coming - The Terror,,1,,00,,False,,True,,The Capstone Booster has increased what you are now capable of, far surpassing what normal practitioners can do.%%%%Where before you could control spiders in a few metres you can now do so for a few miles linking up to every arachnid within your range knowing their species, their location everything.%%%%Your transformation was not left untouched, with its size and power increased to even tower over small buildings (at your peak) with all the boosts to your physical might such size entails.%%%%While transformed, you could easily fend off beings on par with the half-god Grotesquery.,,
Signum Linguistics,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Also called Symbol Magic. It’s one of China Sorrows’ specialties. Harnesses a magical language to produce a wide variety of effects. Fairly unique in that it can be learned by anyone, even if they’ve already chosen their discipline.%%%%As such, this magic can be purchased regardless of how many others you’ve bought already, even without Multidisciplinary Magic.,,
Signum Linguistics + Second Coming - Sorrows,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your talent is equal to that of China Sorrows, the world's most well-known user of this discipline.%%%%With this, you have become capable of producing greater effects than before. From producing waves of energy to masquerading as another, you can do it all.%%%%You can even carve sigils into your very body without a single worry of a mistake.%%%%Using this power, you could even seal others’ True Names, provided they meet the requirements for doing so, of course.%%%%What you can do now is virtually limitless, as long as you know the right runes. And if the runes you want don’t exist, you can always just invent your own.,,
Kineticist,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Allows the user to absorb kinetic energy and convert it into raw physical strength.%%%%This can be used to negate the damage of kinetic force against your body from things like projectiles or punches (or the backlash from your own punches) and use it to fuel your own physical attacks.%%%%This art is all but extinct at the present, with one of the few known users being Mr. Bliss.,,
Kineticist + Second Coming - World's Strongest,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mr. Bliss is known as the physically strongest man in the world, and with good reason. His strength was so great that he was able to destroy every part of the Grotesquery that wasn’t a piece of a Faceless One, and in the end fell only in battle against a group of three Faceless Ones.%%%%With the Capstone Booster, your power has increased to rival his, where even the lightest of strikes could pulverize bones without the slightest damage to your own person.%%%%Your durability and reflexes have been similarly enhanced to the point that you could catch a sword with your bare hands, quite literally crush someone’s head between your fingers, and survive a building going down on you with just a few scars to show for it.%%%%With training the sky ISN’T the limit.,,
Sensitivity,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Psychic powers, broken down into sub-specialties; Seers (who see the future), Illusionists (who create illusions), and Hypnotists (who can convince people that something that did happen hasn’t or vice-versa).%%%%While most Sensitives specialize in one category or the other, you’ve been blessed with talent in all three fields.,,
Sensitivity + Second Coming - All Knowing,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Not literally, of course, but the vast majority of Sensitives will start to think you are. Due to the Capstone Booster, your abilities as a Sensitive have been vastly augmented.%%%%Unlike other sensitives, who are only able to see bits and pieces of the future (akin to a few strips in a comic book) you are now able to see the whole page, seeing the distant future in greater detail. Your other Sensitive powers have been similarly enhanced.%%%%Your illusions can span entire cities, and your skill with hypnotism is such that you could even trick someone like Darquesse into thinking they’ve gone on an interplanetary killing spree.,,
Tunneling,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,The ability to pass through solid objects, which open up for you, leaving only cracks behind.%%%%You are also resistant to sigils that ordinarily suppress magical powers, making you much harder to contain.,,
Tunneling + Second Coming - Lord of the Underground,,1,,00,,True,,True,,The Capstone Booster has enhanced your magic.%%%%Instead of leaving cracks, your magic leaves nothing behind. There is nothing signalling your presence; no noise, no cracks. The ground does not shake at your passing, as though you are simply phasing through it with no displacement of the earth around you.%%%%Barring the need to eat, drink, and/or whatever you need to do, you can remain underground indefinitely.%%%%There is nothing and no one that can force you to leave the safety of the underground.%%%%Also, your resistance to certain sigils has now increased. Where before, you would be weakened in their presence, you are now immune.%%%%Before you get too excited though, this immunity applies only to the sigils that Billy-Ray Sanguine is resistant to (i.e. magic suppression sigils).,,
Energy Throwing,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,A fairly popular branch of magic, it converts energy into projectiles.%%%%These projectiles typically take the form of exploding balls that can be thrown like grenades or beams of energy.%%%%These beams may be projected from the user’s palms, eyes, or mouth.%%%%While firing from the eyes is generally more powerful, it will also temporarily blind the user. Firing from the mouth is even more powerful than the eyes, but terribly difficult to aim.%%%%A skilled energy-thrower may tune the frequency of their attacks, causing them to either scorch the enemy or simply strike with a blunt force.%%%%Overall, this power isn’t terribly versatile, but it is quite destructive.%%%%Yes, you can choose the colour.,,
Energy Throwing + Second Coming - Energy Blasting,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Energy throwers are just children lobbing energy at their targets until they’re lucky enough to hit them. You are not like them.%%%%Unlike the rest, you can control the energy you create, molding it into more defined projections taking on whatever forms you desire.%%%%This only applies to the energy you project, not that of others. Your blasts have also been improved considerably.%%%%Where a normal energy-thrower could barely beat back Wretchlings, your blasts can easily tear them apart. Not even Cleavers with their magic-resistant uniforms could stand up to your attacks.,,
Magiphage,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,The ability to drain magic from a target and transfer magic into objects.%%%%The more experienced the mage, the longer the objects can remain fueled.%%%%Requires physical contact to use.,,
Magiphage + Second Coming - THE Leech,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your ability to leech magic and transfer it has increased. Before, you had to touch to take and transfer.%%%%Now you can do so within a few metres of your position, siphoning the magic of others and transferring it to yourself to recharge your reserves or enhance an attack, to your allies, or to objects.%%%%Like with all disciplines, what you can do will increase with time and practise.,,
Gist,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Allows you to summon a nigh-invulnerable ghostly demon version of yourself. This Gist is connected to your body by a ghostly umbilical cord.%%%%While terrifyingly powerful, this power is incredibly taxing to use, to the point that keeping your Gist out for several minutes is exhausting.%%%%Aside from the demands it places on your magical reserves, if your Gist remains out for too long, you’ll end up possessed, with the Gist gaining control of your body.,,
Gist + Second Coming - Gistlord,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your power has now risen beyond others of your kind, making you much more closely attuned with your Gist.%%%%Not only does this reduce the strain using your power places on your body by a dramatic margin, but it also all but negates the risk of your Gist possessing you due to extended use.%%%%The longer your Gist is active, the stronger it becomes, mutating to grow larger and better adapted for combat against your current foes, though the more monstrous it becomes, the greater the energy required to maintain it.%%%%With practice and training, this cost can be cut down, and you can eventually learn to summon multiple Gists at once.,,
Teleportation,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Exactly what it sounds like. Your starting range and carrying capacity is limited to a few miles and only a single person. With practice and training though, your range can grow to the global scale, while you can teleport entire rooms full of people with minimal effort.%%%%People tend to not like teleporters though. Something about being able to show up anywhere at any time without warning seems to put people on edge.%%%%Oh, and there may or may not be a secret cult that’s been systematically hunting Teleporters down with the intent of wiping out all but one of them, so you’ve got that to look forward to.,,
Teleportation + Second Coming - Astral Projection,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your prowess within your discipline is so great that you have gone beyond the limits of casting your physical form across the world, allowing you to teleport using only your mind.%%%%This enables you to project your consciousness into a new location in the same way that you might teleport your entire body, transferring your mind and senses to faraway places without moving your body, completely invisible and undetectable to mundane senses.%%%%Your body will be vulnerable while you do so, unless it has automated defenses or other occupants that could take over until you return.%%%%Normal protections against teleportation cannot block your projection ability.%%%%Aside from being able to teleport your mind without moving your body (and vice versa), you can target parts of an object for teleportation rather than only moving the whole target, allowing you to rip it to pieces if you so choose.,,
Dimensional Shunting,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You possess the rather unique ability to move between universes through your magical power.%%%%This discipline can be used to either push a target between worlds or to move yourself as needed, though physical contact is required to move a person.%%%%You can also perform an echoing shunt, forcing a target you have touched to cyclically shunt, causing them to automatically and repeatedly bounce between their home universe and a different one (chosen at the time of casting) for an extended period of time, though this effect will eventually wear off once the energy you put into it runs out.%%%%Though this power generally doesn’t come with protections against, say, shunting into a universe where the atmosphere is toxic, yours does, allowing you to get a feel for the world you’re shunting into before you actually make the switch.%%%%You cannot use Dimensional Shunting to visit other Jumps until you obtain your Spark.,,
Dimensional Shunting + Second Coming - Mass Shunting,,1,,00,,True,,True,,The power of your shunting has been enhanced in a number of ways thanks to your immense talent.%%%%First of all, rather than being limited to shunting yourself and those you are in direct contact with, you can move everyone and everything within a targeted radius around yourself. This can be used to move a large number of people, or you could choose to target the entire space and bring the surrounding environment with you as well.%%%%The size of your transfer radius can be increased indefinitely, with exponentially increasing demands on your reserves the larger it gets, but a space with a radius of fifteen meters has the same demands as what touch-based shunting required before.%%%%Additionally, worlds you visit remain marked within your mind, allowing you to target places within those worlds and summon targets you are familiar with from other worlds with ease.%%%%Individual people and objects you have shunted are similarly marked, allowing you to remotely shunt people you have already shunted in the past, either summoning them to your world or banishing them to another with a mere effort of will.,,
Red Right Hand,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Do you want to make people suffer, Jumper?%%%%Your right hand is now red and skinless.%%%%By pointing it at someone, you can cause them to suffer overwhelmingly agonizing pain. Or, if you’re feeling merciful, you can just kill those you point it at, though this ability is much more taxing than merely causing pain.%%%%However, this ability only works on the living; undeads, robots, and other non-living beings won’t be affected in the slightest.%%%%Furthermore, it can only target one person at a time.%%%%Post-Jump, you may have your hand return to a normal appearance, or toggle it to its skinless form as you see fit.%%%%If taken with the Skulduggery Pleasant perk, the bones of your right hand turn red.%%%%%%If you have an alt-form with multiple right hands and you buy Red Right Hand, all of your right hands will be viable conduits for this power. Using freeform shapeshifting to sprout additional right hands won’t help though; it has to be a naturally multi-limbed form.,,
Red Right Hand + Second Coming - Devil's Touch,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your very nature has energized your red right hand, increasing the already agonizing pain that you could previously cause, but that is a parlor trick compared to what you are now capable of.%%%%Now, nothing is beyond your hand. Even if it is already dead or nonliving, you can now bring it death.,,
Warlock,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,A bit of a mixed bag, here.%%%%First off, you command a light-based magic that can paralyze your targets. You can also use this light to heal your wounds, create balls of energy that explode after a time delay, or just shoot your typical destructive energy blasts.%%%%Warlocks can also create Wretchlings, ghostly, decaying things that roam at night, they can also create illusions that can encompass an entire town.%%%%Second and more prominent is your ability to transform your mouth into a grisly, toothy abomination that can eat the souls of your victims.%%%%This allows you to absorb their magical energy to replenish your own.%%%%Two warlocks working together can open portals, with one on each side of the gate.,,
Warlock + Second Coming - Valkyrie Cain,,1,,00,,False,,True,,When Valkyrie Cain lost her True Name, her magic changed dramatically, becoming closer to that used by Witches/Warlocks.%%%%Like her, you can now manipulate ‘white’ energy, allowing you to discharge this power in the form of white lightning.%%%%As your powers grow, you will become capable of feats that wouldn’t be out of place in a Sensitive, such as the ability to control thought, and to see the future, even gaining a measure of control over the speed and intensity of the visions.%%%%Unlike a Sensitive, your visions are often involuntary rather than intentional, and act on a more personal scale, while your ability to control thought is something closer to a Jedi Mind Trick than outright memory alteration. %%%%You are able to create shields around yourself and others, stronger than any sigil could provide.%%%%You can see magic within others, as well as their souls. Rather than simply being able to consume souls for power, now you can disperse them, effectively destroying them.%%%%You can also now replicate a magical effect or discipline and use it on yourself or just plainly use the magic itself(e.g. copying a healer’s ability to heal and using it to heal your own body or enhance a regenerative healing factor.%%%%Who knows what else you will be capable of in time.,,
Necromancy,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Necromancy is, at its core, the power to manipulate shadows.%%%%A necromancer stores their magic inside a physical vessel (a cane, a coat, a gun, armor, etc.) and uses it as a focus to channel their power.%%%%They can use shadows to attack and defend by shaping them into solid constructs. If your focus is destroyed, the power flows back into you, and must be stored in a new vessel before it can be used again.%%%%Necromancers also have the ability to passively sense death around them and draw on it to strengthen their magic.%%%%Many of them can infuse corpses with small fragments of their power to create zombies under their command.%%%%More advanced necromancers can perform a technique called Shadow-walking, a form of teleportation through shadows with a relatively short range (only a few hundred meters).,,
Necromancy + Second Coming - Deathbringer,,1,,00,,True,,True,,With the capstone booster, you become a match for Lord Vile, the greatest Necromancer the world has ever seen.%%%%The range of your shadow-walking is measured in miles, not meters.%%%%Your zombies can range in complexity and power from ‘mindless shambling corpse that infects others’ to beings on par with the White/Black Cleaver, which was skilled enough to use weapons and capable of regenerating endlessly.%%%%You can gather shadows around yourself to fly, and you can perform a technique called the Death Bubble, an area-of-effect attack that rips the life force away from everyone inside its sizable radius and draws it into the caster.%%%%Finally, much like Melancholia St. Clair, you can store your necromantic magic inside your body, allowing you to use it without need for a focus.,,
Blood of the Unnamed,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,The power of The Unnamed.%%%%Grants vastly accelerated healing, the power of flight, the power to summon and manipulate black flames that burn through anything, and the power to heal others who are on the brink of death, returning them to full strength.%%%%You can siphon the lifeforce of others around you (touch-range) to revitalize yourself or further enhance your strength.%%%%Your vitality is such that you are functionally immortal, and can only be killed by high-grade godkiller weapons like the Obsidian Sword.%%%%You are capable of granting your powers to others, though this will deprive you of the ability to use them yourself until you take them back, which you can do at any time.%%%%Finally, once per Jump (or once every ten years), upon your death, you may transfer your spirit into the corpse of a suitable host, claiming it as your own to revive yourself.,,
Blood of the Unnamed + Second Coming - Unnamed Jumper,,1,,00,,True,,True,,The power in your veins has been augmented, placing you above even the Unnamed.%%%%Where before you merely healed at an accelerated rate, now you can even survive and regenerate so long as your head remains somewhat intact.%%%%Your power to heal and transfer lifeforce has been augmented as well, allowing you to even bring the dead back to life, similar to Richard Mellior.%%%%However, the longer the target has been deceased, the greater the lifeforce required, though it doesn’t have to be yours.%%%%The range at which you can absorb lifeforce has also been enhanced, allowing you to perform it at a range of ten metres.%%%%Due to your power, your spirit can now be transferred twice every ten years (twice per jump).%%%%Barring the spirit transfer, what you can do will improve in time.,,
Neoteric,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Neoterics are sorcerers who were never taught how to harness magic into the existing disciplines, so they simply created their own. This has manifested in two different ways.%%%%First, there were some who created original versions of magic.%%%%Second, there were those who copied existing disciplines but without certain weaknesses present in the original versions.%%%%Taking this CAN manifest in a unique magic, but when taken with pre-existing magic, this will act as a modifier for any magic you have purchased here, effectively removing certain weaknesses and vulnerabilities. For example, when taken with Teleportation, a Neoteric could prove capable of ignoring sigils and defenses that prevent teleportation, or simply perform teleportation at a dramatically reduced cost or strain.%%%%An example of a new discipline is the power of Cadaverous Gant, who is able to declare any fixed location to be his home, and while inside, he cannot be killed and can manipulate the place to be however he wishes it to be. For more than one discipline, you’ll have to buy this magic multiple times.%%%%%%The example of Cadaverous Gant’s power should be used as a baseline for creating your own original magic with Neoteric. In general, you should consider the creation process a balancing act; the more general the scope of the magic is, the smaller the scale at which it can operate should be. Higher specificity will afford you higher power, but only in certain situations. Lower specificity will afford you less power, but can be applied in a greater number of situations.,,
Soul Catcher,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,The name says it all, really. This is a device designed by the Necromancers to trap and destroy souls.%%%%Only one soul can be trapped per Soul Catcher. Any being trapped within this device cannot escape from the inside, but can be released by someone with access to the Soul Catcher from the outside.%%%%If your Soul Catcher is destroyed, another will appear in your Warehouse after a week.,,
Enchanted Stone,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,‘The man with the golden eyes’ was the only thing people remembered of Erskine Ravel while he used a certain magical item.%%%%This stone wiped the minds of those around him, forcing them to forget his appearance. The only thing his subordinates and allies could remember about him was his eye colour. You now possess this stone as well, equipped with a full charge of magic and the unique ability to recharge it using your magic.%%%%When the stone is on your person and activated, anyone you talk to, regardless of who they are, will no longer remember you after you leave. They will still remember your conversation, orders you have given, threats you have made, but your name, face, and any identifying characteristics other than your eyes will be wiped away.%%%%This stone doesn’t erase technological evidence, such as photos or video, so be careful about when and where you use it.,,
Library of Sorrow,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,China Sorrows is many things, but above all else, she is a collector of all things magical. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her library, a home to many lost and obscure magical tomes.%%%%Now, it seems you have come to possess a library of your own, equally massive and chock full of rare, obscure, and lost magical knowledge.%%%%In future Jumps, this library will update and expand to encompass the vast majority of that world’s historical magical knowledge, barring tomes that are one-of-a-kind. You’ll need to get those yourself.,,
Magic Sucker,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,This sword, as its name implies, can temporarily take away the magic of others.%%%%Originally created in a dimension where Mevolent won the war, this was used in his battle against Darquesse and later destroyed.%%%%However, you seem to have in your hands the exact same magical item, able to steal away even the magic of someone who has discovered their True Name.%%%%Obviously, it is useless against those who have no magic.%%%%If destroyed, you’ll have a new one arriving in your Warehouse after a week.%%%%Be careful, as breaking the weapon results in an explosion.,,
Faceless One's Corpse,,2,,-8000,,False,,True,,It seems that the corpse Baron Vengeous found wasn’t the only one. This is a corpse of a Faceless One, an eldritch abomination, one of many that has existed for quite a long time. Somehow, this one died and its corpse has come into your possession.%%%%In the past, one of these was used as the basis for a patchwork monster made from several different creatures and sorcerers. The resulting creature was known as the Grotesquery, a nigh-unstoppable abomination that obeyed only the commands of its master.%%%%What you do with it is up to you. It’s rather expensive, owing to the fact that it is the corpse of a ‘god’.,,
The Book of Names,,2,,-8000,,True,,True,,A legendary item created by the Ancients, it contains the Three Names of everyone on the planet; their Birth Name, their Taken Name (should they have one), and their True Name.%%%%Names are added when new people are born and choose a Taken Name, and disappear once they die. Ordinarily, this would be held under lock and key by the Irish Sanctuary, but you seem to have gotten your hands on a copy of your own. Do try to be careful to keep it out of the wrong hands.%%%%In future Jumps, the Book will update to accommodate the new setting.,,
Obsidian Blade,,2,,-8000,,True,,True,,Created when the universe came into being, when a small gap in reality drew in particles of matter and dust over the eons until it gained a weight of it’s own and fell to Earth. This was then forged into a weapon by the Faceless Ones.%%%%The resulting blade, which you now own, destroys everything it touches, wiping it from existence. So, you know, be careful with it.%%%%You may choose if this is the original blade, or a copy of it. You can also import another weapon into this role.%%%%If it is destroyed (though how you would actually do that, I haven’t a clue), it will reappear in your Warehouse at the start of the next Jump.,,
Drop In - Inheritance,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,Cold, hard cash, pure and simple. Grants the equivalent of $500,000 dollars per purchase, in whatever your starting location’s currency is. If your starting location lacks a valid currency, default to one of your choosing.%%%%Only the first purchase is free for Drop Ins.,,
Drop In - Echo Stone,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,An echo stone is an object that allows the user to imprint their personality into it, creating a copy of the individual with all their memories. Once an individual is copied onto the stone, another cannot be imprinted on to it.%%%%Normally, imprinting takes 3 nights of sleeping next to the stone for the process to occur. However, yours comes with a copy of your mind already installed, so if you ever want to pick your own brain, or just lend it to someone else so they can consult you, there you are.%%%%Also comes with a cradle to recharge the stone’s magic.,,
Drop In - Gromwood,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This house on a hill, large enough to be considered a manor, has come into your possession, perhaps after the death of a relative. While it has many rather ominous pictures on its walls and no small amount of unused sports equipment, the house’s true appeal is what lies underneath it.%%%%Through a secret passageway, you may access an extensive labyrinth hidden below the property. This labyrinth, called the Caves of the Void, is home to a variety of monsters capable of smelling magic, which they use to hunt intruders. You, of course, won’t be hunted by these beasts (unless you want to be, for whatever reason).%%%%Within this maze are veins of a special black crystal, which has been a key component used to create weapons like the Scepter of the Ancients, capable of killing gods.%%%%And in the deepest part of the caves is the Source Fountain, a pool that turns whatever you place within it magical.%%%%The house is completely paid off, and has free running water, electricity, AC, and secure internet.,,
Drop In - The Scepter of the Ancients,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A golden rod the length of a thigh bone, ending in a large black crystal, this weapon is a legendary artifact crafted by the Faceless Ones.%%%%It is capable of firing bolts of black lightning which reduce anything they strike to dust. This lightning can even harm targets with high levels of magic resistance, and can kill gods.%%%%Additionally, the weapon sings to its user, warning them when enemies approach them. However, those who carry the blood of the Ancients are undetectable to this defense.%%%%Finally, only one person may use the Scepter at any given time; as long as you live, no one else will be able to wield its power. And unlike some people, being an undead won’t count as no longer being alive. If you so choose, you may import this into an existing weapon, granting it the same properties.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Resolute Thread,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A spool of enchanted thread, magically enhanced so that it grows stronger when more pressure is applied to it.%%%%The greater the pressure, the stronger the thread becomes.%%%%Your spool contains twenty meters of thread, and you know the ritual to create more.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Cloaking Sphere,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A small ball with two distinct halves.%%%%When the halves are twisted away from each other, the sphere projects a bubble of invisibility, concealing people or objects from the view of those outside the bubble’s radius.%%%%The size of the bubble can be modified to match the user’s needs.%%%%People and objects that enter the sphere’s radius after it has already been activated will remain visible from the outside, and cannot see those who are concealed by it.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Will of the Jumper,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This is a version of a very powerful spell created by three Elders of the Irish Sanctuary to protect the Book of Names.%%%%This spell prevented anyone from approaching the book by a very simple means; the closer you were to getting it, the less you wanted it. Ordinarily, this spell was tied to the lives of the Elders, but this version has been retrofitted to get the same power when only bound to your own life.%%%%By placing this spell over an item, you ensure no one will be able to take it as the closer they get to it, the less they desire it. Not ‘closer’ as in physically closer, but ‘closer’ as in ‘closer to obtaining it’.%%%%This protection can be placed over more than one item, but the more items you place it on, the less effective it becomes.%%%%You can also choose to bind the protection to the life of another person.%%%%Unlike the Elders’ version, you are immune to its effects, so you will always be able to access the items you have protected.,,
Sanctuary Worker - Waxworks Museum,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,This waxworks museum has seen better business, but it seems like no one wants to come around now that all the famous sculptures have been shipped to other branches. That’s perfectly fine by you though, as the real value of the building is what lies beneath it; your very own Sanctuary building.%%%%This facility has everything you’d need to run a magical government, from squads of Cleavers to offices full of mages working administrative jobs to special investigators and agents to a specialized vault for storing rare or dangerous magical items to a jail that can hold even the strongest of magical captives.%%%%Of course, technically you only own the building (unless you also bought the Elder perk), but everyone working there has taken this to mean they work for you too. As such, you can order the people working there to perform tasks on your behalf, whether that means investigating your enemies, throwing your enemies in jail, or just helping you with your research.%%%%The people inside are NPCs, and will likely have commonplace varieties of whatever the local Jump’s superpowers are. If you bring it to a Jump without superpowers, they will have lower-end magic from this setting.%%%%The exception is the Cleavers, who remain the same throughout.,,
Detective - Bespoke's Best,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Ghastly Bespoke is many things, but he’s best known for his immense skill as a tailor.%%%%With this purchase, you now own a closet full of Bespoke’s finest tailor-made suits, all made to match your size perfectly. Not only that, this closet includes suits made to fit any and all of your alt-forms. These clothes can protect you from impacts, cuts, punches, even gunshots and slight magic.%%%%If you have a specific outfit you want augmented with these properties, feel free to import it.,,
Detective - The Bently,,2,,2000,,False,,True,,Your very own 1954 Bentley R-Type Continental. Only 208 were ever made, and you’ve somehow gotten your hands on one of them.%%%%It houses a six-cylinder, 4.5-liter engine, and has been seamlessly retrofitted with all sorts of modern conveniences, including central locking, climate control, and satellite navigation.%%%%Comes in any color you want for both the interior and exterior.%%%%If it ever gets damaged, you’ll find it returned to pristine condition in about twelve hours, so don’t fret if it gets a little dinged up.,,
Detective - Magic Suppression Cuffs,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Basically what it says on the tin. Handcuffs that, when placed on a target, temporarily nullifies their magic, rendering it unusable.%%%%While these cuffs nullify magic, they won’t stop abilities that don’t originate from magic or are just physical characteristics.%%%%The cuffs you possess have the unique ability to change shape depending on who you are restraining.%%%%If they are somehow broken or destroyed (though that will take a LOT of damage), you will have another set waiting in your Warehouse in 24 hours.,,
Detective - The Accelerator,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,This is a machine created by Dr. Rote which can boost the power of other mages to incredible new heights.%%%%The Accelerator draws its power from the Source of all magic.%%%%In the hands of ordinary mages, it could power them up to the level where they could destroy dozens of their fellows with ease, but in the hands of someone like Darquesse, the result is unthinkable.%%%%You now possess your own copy of this machine, located in your Warehouse or in a property you own. Before you get too excited, the boost the Accelerator provides is only temporary; after a while, that boost will start to slowly fade away, gradually returning the mage to their normal power level.%%%%Ordinarily, the Accelerator becomes a time bomb after being turned on, continuing to draw on magic until it explodes. The resulting explosion would deliver magic to every living being on the planet, including Mortals.%%%%Your version of the Accelerator will not explode, unless you want it to for some reason.%%%%Furthermore, unlike the original, yours will not require a willingly donated soul to be deactivated.%%%%If you decide to blow up your Accelerator, you will receive a new one at the start of the next Jump.,,
Villain - Sanguineous Razor,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A straight razor. This simple, easily concealed weapon is enchanted with a special property, which causes the wounds it inflicts to heal slowly and leave behind scars that will never fade.%%%%This item may be imported into a similar weapon.,,
Villain - Hollow Legion,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,An army of Hollow Men, animated skin bags bloated with a putrid green gas. Individually, they aren’t very powerful, and are best-suited to menial labor.%%%%Their true strength comes from sheer numbers, which they use to overwhelm their targets.%%%%Their skin is similar to paper, and they are unaffected by weapons without sharp points or edges. Their skin and the gas within is rather flammable though.%%%%Normal Hollow Men are rather easily torn apart, and deflate quickly. However, there is also a stronger, sturdier variety with skin so tough it would take a chainsaw to tear into them.%%%%This item gives you five hundred normal Hollow Men, along with one hundred of the enhanced version.%%%%It also comes with the knowledge of how to create more of both varieties.,,
Villain - Church of Jumper,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Your very own cult.%%%%Rather small in terms of membership, but all incredibly devoted to you, to the point of worshipping you as a god.%%%%These zealots will possess minor magical abilities of their own, and can likely hold their own in combat against your typical sorcerer, but their true value is in acting behind the scenes.%%%%Your cultists are skilled in the arts of infiltration and social manipulation, allowing them to easily integrate themselves into key parts of society.%%%%Their ideology is almost infectious, and they have a talent for converting others to join the faith. Unique individuals may not be brought into future Jumps, but increases in the cult’s numbers and overall power levels will be conserved.%%%%You may choose whether the existence of your cult is a known quantity or not upon entering new Jumps.,,
Villain - The Desolation Engine,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A magical Weapon of Mass Destruction.%%%%Simply put, this is a bomb. It has an appearance like a stone hourglass, containing a green liquid that turns red when the device is armed.%%%%When it goes off, the Desolation Engine annihilates everything within a one mile radius; every living thing, building, tree, and stone is obliterated. You may remotely arm and detonate this device, set it to explode on a timer, or even invoke specific arming and detonation conditions.%%%%For example, one Desolation Engine was modified to arm itself when held by a specific individual, and then detonate once it left his hands.%%%%Your Desolation Engine will respawn in your Warehouse a month after it is used.,,
Import,,3,,-500,,False,,False,,Standard import option; pay 50 CP per companion you want to import. They gain 600 CP along with an origin and the associated discounts. For 300 CP, you may import 8 Companions using the same rules. Imported Companions may purchase items worth 200 CP or less.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,1000,,False,,True,,Find someone you like in this world? For just 100 CP, you can bring them with you on your Chain. There are a few people you’d have to buy separately though...%%%%%%You may not take Argeddion, Darquesse, or any of the Faceless Ones as Companions.,,
Valkyrie Cain,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,The series protagonist. Comes with the full Drop In perkline, minus the capstone, one purchase of the Bespoke’s Best item, and the capstone-boosted version of the Warlock magic.%%%%She’s an experienced martial artist and detective, and is skilled enough in magical combat to defeat opponents with centuries of experience that she lacks.%%%%She also happens to be a descendant of the Ancient Ones, has some Faceless One blood in her, and doesn’t have a True Name.,,
Skulduggery Pleasant,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,The skeleton detective himself. He’s a few centuries old, and is a highly proficient detective, a master of Elemental magic, a veteran of a war that spanned multiple centuries, and a generally sarcastic fellow.%%%%He comes with the full Detective perkline, Advanced Elemental magic, and the Bespoke’s Best and Bentley items.,,
Stupid Name,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Every sorcerer picks a Taken Name for themselves, to use in public. And these names can get pretty weird. Unfortunately, yours is really, really...stupid. Expect to have a difficult time getting people to take you seriously.,,
A New Adventure,,4,,20000,,True,,False,,I'm afraid you won’t be leaving after 10 years. By taking this drawback, your Jump will now be extended by another 10 years. May be purchased a maximum of ten times, extending your Jump by up to 100 years.,,Purchased 10 times%%Retail rocker
A Ghastly Visage,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Something bad happened to your face. The kind of bad thing that leaves hideous scars all over them.%%%%They won’t impede your ability to speak or see or do other things that require a face, but they do make you really, really ugly.,,
Eyeless,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,Like a certain Texan Hitman Deluxe, you are missing your eyes. Unlike said Texan, this does not grant you enhanced vision. In fact, it robs you of any vision at all.%%%%You can still use your other senses just fine, but your eyes are gone.%%%%Of course, this also means you will be unable to use any eye-based powers until you get your eyes back at the end of the Jump.,,Retail rocker
Ire of the Church,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The Faceless Cult has their eyes on you, Either because they believe you stand in the way of their goals, you are connected to someone they have a vendetta against, or they believe your power can be used to summon their gods.%%%%A powerful organization with many experienced veteran mages from The War and zealot assassins.%%%%They are sure to make you stay more... lively for the duration of the jump.,,
In the Thick of It,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,You’ve been cast as something of a recurring character in this story, Jumper. Whether through luck or the intentional acts of others, you can’t seem to keep yourself from being pulled into the thick of the plot. In fact, it feels like you can barely go a month without running into the skeleton detective and his sidekick, caught up in some grand scheme or another.%%%%In case you’re wondering why this is a drawback, recall that Skulduggery and Valkyrie’s escapades have included hunting down a madman with a godkiller superweapon, fighting immortal half-god abominations, fighting actual eldritch abominations, and participating in international wars between sorcerers.%%%%In other words, things will frequently be quite dangerous, and the threat level insists on going up over time.,,Retail rocker
Local Limitations,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,No out-of-Jump powers or items. You have to use what you buy here.,,
Traitor,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Do you have any idea how many of the villains in this series are good guys gone bad, biding their time to stab everyone in the back? The answer is a lot of them.%%%%And now, there’s one waiting for you too. Someone you consider a friend, someone you’re incapable of even imagining would turn against you. Maybe they’re a companion, who knows.%%%%But they will turn on you before the end of the Jump. Keep one eye on your back, and another on your friends, Jumper.,,
Vampire,,4,,3000,,False,,True,,You’re a vampire now. This is not a good thing.%%%%For starters, you require human blood to survive. You also have a fatal allergy to salt and salt water; if you ingest any, you will die in agony as your throat constricts, regardless of whether or not you actually need to breathe.%%%%After sundown, you mutate into a hideous monstrosity, literally ripping your way out of your skin to do so. While in this form, you will be an uncontrolled monster, attacking anyone and anything you can find, incapable of distinguishing friends from foes. This transformation can be suppressed using a drug that includes a special combination of hemlock and wolfsbane.%%%%You also don’t get the indefinite lifespan that other vampires have.%%%%Post-Jump, your monstrous vampire form becomes an alt-form, with its salt allergy removed.,,
Power Surge,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Like a certain would-be Deathbringer, your power is now in a state of flux, constantly ebbing and flowing as the Surge that normally stabilizes a sorcerer’s power loops through your body.%%%%With very little warning, your powers can surge to their peak levels, or fall to the point where you are all but powerless.%%%%If this happens at the wrong moment, you could find yourself in a very sticky situation.,,
Dead Man Walking,,4,,8000,,True,,False,,Your start time now gets reset to the start of The War, an international war between sorcerers that stretched from the 1700’s to the 1930’s.%%%%To make matters worse, you’re now bound to serve in a unit known as the Dead Men, so named because they took on countless suicide missions.%%%%The Jump’s end time has not changed, so you still have to survive all the way to the modern era.,,Retail rocker
The Darquesse Within,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Your True Name has a mind of its own. It’ll try to take over your body, probably to do horrible things to the people you love and the world as a whole.%%%%Worse yet, over time it becomes easier for your True Name to take over, and the longer it stays in control.%%%%When it controls your body, it has access to all your powers and proves itself stronger and more skilled than you are at using them.%%%%If your True Name takes over completely, consider your chain over.,,
Kingdom of the Wicked,,4,,12000,,True,,False,,Ignore your choice of location. You now start in the Leibniz Universe, where Mevolent won The War all those centuries ago.%%%%It’s a bad place, ruled by one of the strongest and most ruthless sorcerers in history. The Mevolent of this universe proved capable of matching Darquess, a sorceress with a sealed True Name, despite not having his own True Name sealed.%%%%He rules this universe with an iron fist, commands legions of Cleavers and faithful despots, has spies everywhere, and he is aware of your presence from the moment you arrive. You should probably start running.%%%%Cannot be taken with A Red Sky Overhead,,Retail rocker
A Red Sky Overhead,,4,,8000,,False,,False,,You must be truly desperate for points to take this. Your starting location has been locked, changed to a universe with a red sky.%%%%This is the home of the eldritch nightmares known as the Faceless Ones, creatures that are highly resistant to both magical and physical damage, are strong enough to overpower those with sealed True Names, and revel in the suffering of the universes they visit.%%%%It is a desolate place, with only a few surviving inhabitants.

Unluckily for you, this means you will have to survive for two years before that chance will come around.%%%%If you took this with Dead Man walking, you instead start 300 years earlier than you normally would, when this universe was still populated, and the Faceless Ones are just arriving to lay waste to this world.%%%%Cannot be taken with Kingdom of the Wicked,,
