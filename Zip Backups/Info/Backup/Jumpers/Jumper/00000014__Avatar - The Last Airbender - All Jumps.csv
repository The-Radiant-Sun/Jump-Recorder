Nomad,,0,,00,,False,,False,,On second though, the "dropped in out of the blue" thing has a certain appeal to it. While you don't gain any training, skills, knowledge, or connections that you don't purchase yourself, you also don't have to deal with any new memories, nor the attachments which come with them.,,
Civilian,,0,,-500,,False,,False,,Born into a humble family in one of the three existing Nations, your only exposure to the flames of war comes from raids, and even those may be unknown to you. This means you're going to have a difficult time dealing with violence, but it also means you've probably got a lot of neighborhood friends, as well as a modest home in your starting location.,,
Warrior,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Trained from childhood to fight and die for your country, you're a talented young warrior who managed to catch the eye of your higher-ups. Your military background means that you tend to look at things with a military mindset, making it hard to relate to civilians or those of a different Nation, but if you prove yourself you could go quite far.,,
Noble,,0,,-1000,,True,,False,,Whether the Chief of one of the Water Tribes or simply a wealthy merchant family, your parents are high-ranking officials within your Nation. This gives you a certain level of authority, as well as important connections; on the other hand, you're accustomed to a certain lifestyle, and find it hard to adjust to lesser circumstances.,,
Water Tribes,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Adaptable and community-minded, the Water Tribes consist of several societies predominantly centered around the North and South Poles. Each is governed by a tribal chief, although the Southern Water Tribe's chieftan has left to assist the Earth Kingdom, leaving that tribe scattered and disorganized. Their philosophy is based on balance - push and pull - and while they prefer peace, they have a strong warrior tradition. Until the advent of the Fire Nation's Navy, they were the strongest power in the ocean, though their small holdings and inhospitable terrain rendered them weaker in most other areas.%%%%Waterbending is an extremely adaptable art, concentrating on the flow of energy and fluidly changing between attack and defense. As the element of change, Waterbenders are extremely adept at changing the state of water, converting water into ice and steam at whim. Due to the influence of the moon, they gain strength at night and when the moon waxes, but weaken when it wanes.,,
Earth Kingdom,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Proud lovers of tradition, the Earth Kingdom is by far the largest of the four Nations, as well as the most diverse. Their vast territory is divided into many provinces, though those within it still consider themselves members of the Earth Kingdom due to their shared traditions and history. Basing their philosophy on the Earth itself, they favor conservative strategies in life, moving only when necessary, then taking a direct and forceful approach to the problem. Their wealth comes in the form of agriculture and mineral wealth, although the greatest of these sources have been slowly but surely conquered by the Fire Nation.%%%%Earthbending is a balanced and potent art, favoring defense until the right moment, then powerful and decisive attacks to overwhelm the opponent. Calling upon both stone and soil, Earthbenders are also capable of transforming entire battlefields, creating pillars of rock or transforming ground into quicksand. However, they cannot bend metal, due to its processed state.,,
Fire Nation,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Passionate, willful, and innovative, the Fire Nation is the most powerful of all of the Nations, both economically and militarily. They believe that this greatness comes with the burden to share it with the world, and revere the Fire Lord, their autocratic monarch, as the bringer of light and guidance to the world. They act quickly and decisively, caring more about the final result than the means by which it is achieved. For the past hundred years, this combination of decisive action and creativity has led to an industrial revolution, where Firebending became utilized to construct machinery and technology far beyond those of any other Nation.%%%%Firebending is generally a very direct art, requiring a constant source of energy from the bender, and Firebenders tend to favor direct and successive attacks to fuel it. Novices will find it has few defensive moves, though skilled Firebenders may prove otherwise. Due to the influence of the sun, they gain strength during the day.,,
Air Nomads,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Smallest of the Four Nations, the Air Nomads were a nation of wanderers who congregated at four temples, in the directions of the compass, to learn Airbending. Pacifistic and free-spirited, Air Nomads preferred to evade rather than confront directly, and sought spiritual enlightenment more than any of the other Nations. Their enlightenment made it so that every Air Nomad had the potential to become an Airbender - and a potential enemy of the Fire Nation. For this reason, and to eliminate the threat of the Avatar, they were slaughtered to the last by Fire Lord Sozin. Not a single Air Nomad escaped the genocide, and their unique culture and abilities have been lost to the world. For this reason, only Nomads may choose this Nation.%%%%Airbending was a versatile and dynamic art, though used almost purely for defense. Airbending had few if any finishing moves, let alone lethal ones, instead giving a practitioner a variety of techniques designed to knock foes off-balance. It also favored enhancement of one's own agility, using the air to send the Airbender flying into the sky.,,
Location,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Where you begin depends to some degree upon the Nation you've chosen, though it's possible you'll find yourself a very long way from home. Roll 1d8 to determine where you start; you may also pay 100 CP to choose any of the options below.%%%%1: National Capital – Whether you were born there or are just visiting, you've found yourself in the very largest city in your entire Nation. Those from the Earth Kingdom will find themselves in the Lower Circle of Ba Sing Se, while those of the Fire Nation will find themselves in the Capital's Harbor City, and those of the Water Tribes will have a home in the icy walls of the North Pole. Air Nomads will awaken in the hidden Western Air Temple, hanging in the mountains north of the Fire Nation.%%%%2: Lesser City – Though not as grand as the Capital, you've wound up in one of the larger settlements in your Nation. If you are in the Earth Kingdom, this will be Omashu, while for the Water Tribes, this will be one of the icy villages in the South Pole, and for the Fire Nation, the Fire Fountain City. Air Nomads will find themselves in the Eastern Air Temple, among the company of the mysterious Guru Pathik.%%%%3: Middle of Nowhere – While you've still found yourself within the borders of your Nation, it's not the sort of place you'd want to stay forever. If you're from the Earth Kingdom, this will be Misty Palms Oasis at the edge of the Si Wong Desert, while if you're Fire Nation it will be Jang Hui, a small fishing village. Meanwhile, members of the Water Tribe will find their home deep in the Foggy Swamp, among the Waterbending tribe that dwells there, and Air Nomads will wake up on Whaletail Island, at the edge of the Earth Kingdom, among the charred and ancient remnants of an Air Nomad settlement.%%%%4: Allied Town – You're a bit far from home, but at least you've found yourself in friendly territory. For Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom members, this is the Lesser City of your opposite number - Omashu for the Water Tribe, the North Pole for the Earth Kingdom. Air Nomads will instead wind up in the outer ring of Ba Sing Se, along with a passport with a false identity should they wish to leave. Finally, those of the Fire Nation will find themselves in Yu Dao, oldest of the Fire Nation colonies.%%%%5: Enemy Territory – You've wound up somewhere people won't be happy to see you. If you're from any Nation save the Fire Nation, this will be Shu Jing, a peaceful, secluded Settlement deep within the Fire Nation. If you're from the Fire Nation, on the other hand, you'll have found yourself in Gaoling, a large town in the southern Earth Kingdom near the Foggy Swamp and far from Fire Nation territory.%%%%6: Deep Trouble - You've found yourself about as far from home as you could imagine. If you're from the Fire Nation, you've found yourself deep in the middle ring of Ba Sing Se, the Earth Kingdom's capital. Anyone else will have found themselves in the Fire Nation Capital's Caldera. In either event, you are alone, without any idea how you got there, nor any idea how to get home. Be extremely careful – there's significant security here, and they will actively be looking for spies.%%%%7: Free Choice - The Spirits have smiled upon you. You may begin anywhere in the Avatar World.%%%%8: Elsewhere – The Spirits have again smiled upon you, but it is not a friendly smile. You awaken in the location of your choice, but it is not in the Physical World - instead, you are lost in the Spirit World, a parallel plane similar bordering it but entirely distinct. You are without any ability to Bend until you find a way to escape, and that will prove difficult indeed - unless you find a place and time when the borders are thin, only a powerful Spirit will be able to free you... and such Spirits may drive hard bargains for those who seek their aid.,,
Nomad - Sense of Humor,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Everyone could use a good laugh, and you're the guy who makes it happen. You've developed an incredible wit, perfect sense of comedic timing, and uncanny ability to keep a straight face, making it so you always have the snark, comeback, or joke for every situation. You're also quite good at pratfalls, making it so that any time you fail people are more likely to think it's funny than infuriating or humiliating.,,
Nomad - Spiritualist,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Though only the Avatar may truly act as a bridge between the Spirit and Human worlds, you're close to his level. You may innately sense activity within the Spirit World, and with effort, view or even cross into it. Spirits are also much more receptive to you, rarely acting with outright hostility and usually at least willing to talk with you. You also gain an in-depth understanding of all but the most obscure spiritual practices and beliefs within the Avatar world.,,
Nomad - Innovative,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You're a true genius, the kind who can launch an industrial revolution single-handedly. You can easily come up with fantastic new concepts for solving almost any problem, and adapt existing ideas you've come up with to work using any resources available. While you might not be able to make a steam engine with stone age tools, that'll only be a problem for as long as it takes you to design the tools you need - which won't be long. This mindset isn't just limited to technology, either - you'll come up with novel strategies, fighting styles, and Bending moves just as easily.,,
Civilian - Tradesman,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,There's more to life, and even war, than fighting, and you know that better than most. Pick a single trade aside from direct combat - you gain a lifetime of experience in that field, truly understanding the ins and outs of your field. This may be anything from hunting to architecture to tea-making to managing a cabbage stand - even crafting siege engines is fair game. You may take this perk multiple times, each time learning a new trade.,,
Civilian - Peacekeeper,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Violence isn't always the answer, and you're an expert at finding other ones. You've developed the interpersonal skills necessary to quickly find the root of almost any conflict, and bring it to satisfactory resolution. While some conflicts run too deep for you to pacify, you can ordinarily mediate anything short of outright wars, and with time, effort, and determination, may even be able to end one in a treaty instead of further bloodshed.,,
Civilian - Chi Mastery,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,All living organisms share the same roots - the same flow of cosmic life energy, focused through the Chakras of the body. With this perk, the flow of that energy is as apparent to you as your own breath, both within yourself and within others. Such knowledge comes with amazing benefits, ranging from the ability to enhance your own chi, greatly boosting any abilities which require it, to quickly diagnosing any abnormalities - such as wounds or disease - to learning exactly which spots in the body to strike to disable the chi of others, incapacitating them or disabling their Bending.,,
Warrior - Trained Soldier,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,There's a war going on, and you're ready to fight in it. Pick a single area of military specialization, ranging from rank-and-file soldier to naval officer to commando - you gain a lifetime of experience in that field, understanding it as if you enlisted as soon as you could walk. Regardless of your specialty, you also gain military-level combat experience, sufficient to easily defeat an entire gang of armed rabble without similar training.,,
Warrior - Idea And Complaining Guy,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Plans are your forte. Once you have an objective in mind, you can quickly understand the best way - or even ways - to achieve it utilizing your resources available, while minimizing any risks and consequences to your side. You're also very quick to understand plans that others have come up with, and by mulling them over, can easily determine what flaws they have, and how you might better achieve the same objectives.,,
Warrior - Art of War,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Creativity, versatility, intelligence - those are the traits which define a great warrior, and you have them in spades. At a glance, you take in the world around you, instantly understanding the lay of the land and how to make it do the work for you. Any weaknesses your opponents have become readily apparent, and you can quickly figure out how to take advantage of them, while shoring up your own. Any weapon you hold becomes an extension of your own body, your mind open to the endless possibilities for its use. Just work on your technique, and soon, you'll take on armies singlehandedly.,,
Noble - Mind Your Manners,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,While you may choose to leave it behind once in a while, you've been trained in the art of proper society behavior, and you're good at it. From a Fire Nation beach party to the Earth King's personal soiree, you know exactly how to behave to fit in anywhere. Even when exposed to cultures you've never heard of, you'll instantly pick up enough etiquette to not make a fool of yourself, and rapidly familiarize yourself enough to make anyone think you were born there.,,
Noble - The Chase,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Person, place, thing, even vague concepts such as "honor" - once you've set your mind to it, you will find what you seek, even if you need to cross the world to find it. Not only are your tracking and information gathering skills top-notch, but the spirits themselves seem to guide you, helping you catch lucky breaks when your quarry would evade you. You've also gained a level of determination sufficient to ensure you'll see things through to the end, whatever it may be. Just keep in mind that this end may not be what you thought, especially when you seek a concept - the spirits have a way of giving you what you truly need rather than just what you want.,,
Noble - Master of the Game,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Some people Bend rocks and some people Bend puddles. You Bend people, and you're very good at it. All the little dances of politics come to you as naturally as breathing - you can easily tell what others are really after, while concealing your own intentions completely. So, too, does manipulating others, be it through persuasion, deceit, or intimidation - your polite request is harder to disobey than a king's command, and people would rather face an army than your glower. Launching a coup to destable an entire city-state would be little more than a weekend diversion for you.,,
Bending Arts,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You were born with the ability to manipulate the element of your nation, and have been trained in its use. The Bending Arts differ from element to element, but always involve a combination of physical movements designed to evoke that element, focused with the will of the Bender. Bending an element provides substantial control over it, allowing you to move it, shape it, and direct it, though the exact nature of each depends on the individual element. It should be noted, however, that you cannot actually create an element - though Firebenders can transform their body heat into a raging inferno and Airbenders can make the breath from their lungs into a gale, Waterbenders and Earthbenders must have a source of their element to Bend.,,
Nomad - Maneuverable Bender,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have a natural aptitude for using Bending to enhance your movements. Though each element has its specialties, all of them provide a variety of ways to increase your speed, agility, and acrobatic prowess, as well as give you unique methods of movement. Whether you're leaping gorges with gusts of flame or wind, gliding across a lake on a slab of ice, or crawling across a ceiling with rock shoes and gloves, where you go few others could hope to follow. You are also able to better use your Bending art on the go, adapting your forms to take advantage of your natural stride.,,
Civilian - Utilitarian Bender,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Bending can certainly be used as a weapon, but it can also be so much more, and you have a natural talent for using it for these more constructive pursuits. Constructing entire buildings piece by piece with Earthbending, healing using Waterbending, blacksmithing with Firebending, or even just grabbing a stubborn out-of-reach tool with Airbending - you're a master at using your abilities for day-to-day life. This also increases your ability to perform precision bending, ranging from freezing a single raindrop to creating a sculpture so life-like it captures each individual hair.,,
Warrior - Combat Bender,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Since time immemorial, Bending has served as mankind's sword and shield - and now it's yours. You are unusually skilled in using your Bending in combat - shaping your element into lethal or non-lethal strikes, deflecting or countering others, even controlling a battlefield's terrain all come naturally to you. You are even able to adapt your forms into martial techniques, allowing you to use them in close combat even without your element. This runs both ways - should you know any other forms of martial arts, you can adapt your bending forms to them, letting you strike with your element.,,
Noble - Cooperative Bender,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Though your own Bending may or may not be anything special, what you excel in is harmonizing it with the bending of others. By directing other Benders while bending along with them, your team can perform feats rivaled only by a fully- empowered Avatar. This isn't limited to your own element, either; if you have Benders from other Nations working with you, you can work with them just as easily, letting you combine elements to fantastic effect. This has also given you practice with wide-scale bending, and even without a team, the amount of your element you can bend has greatly increased.,,
Water Specialization - Lifebending,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Water Tribe only%%%%Water is the source of all life, and all life is a source of water. You are one of the rare Waterbenders able to access this source, bending water within living organisms. Aside from enhancing your healing, you may now control water within plants, leeching it from them or twisting them into any shape you desire. However, under the full moon, you gain the power to Bloodbend, controlling animals and even humans as your puppets, or leaving them as dessicated corpses. With time, you may truly master this art, Bloodbending even in the light of day.,,
Earth Specialization - Metalbending,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Earth Kingdom only%%%%Long thought to be impossible, you are able to sense and Bend the tiniest impurities of earth within metal, target them, and use them to bend the metal itself. Though much more difficult than Earthbending, mastery of this art will enable you to move and shape metal objects as you please, tearing through solid steel like it was tissue paper or tossing tanks like childrens' toys. However, as an Earthbending specialty, this will only work on metals with impurities; completely pure metal will forever be out of your ability to control.,,
Fire Specialization - Lightningbending,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Fire Nation only%%%%You are one of a very few set of firebenders able to separate positive and negative energy within your body, using this imbalance to create lightning. A dangerous and difficult art, it requires an absence of emotion and peace of mind; any deviation can prove fatal. However, its power is unrivaled, making those able to utilize it extremely feared. You have also mastered the art of lightning redirection, guiding electricity through your body before expelling it harmlessly.,,
Air Specialization - Pressurebending,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Air Nomad only%%%%You have learned a unique form of Airbending invented right before the Genocide, utilizing a combination of wind and movement of air to create areas of extremely highly pressure. By preventing these areas from equalizing by surrounding it in a shell of high-speed wind, the pressure within these shells causes the air within to act as if it was solid, effectively letting you create short-lived objects. This art can also be used to create extreme low- pressure zones, and if you master it, you may even be able to create true vacuums.,,
Bending Genius,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are a born master of your Element, using it on a level that most Benders could spend a lifetime failing to achieve. Where others toss boulders, you throw hills; where others could freeze a raindrop, you can transform a rainstorm into ice. Even the most trivial effort will allow you to learn any bending form you observe, and with casual practice you can master, then improve, on them. This genius also enhances, rather than supplants, any other Bending perks you've purchased; your talents are now exponentially greater, and your mastery also applies to the Specialized Bending Art which you learned, letting you master that art with little more difficulty than you'd have with the pure form.,,
Avatar Cycle,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Like the legendary Avatar, you have been blessed with a unique cycle of reincarnation, connecting your lives from one to the next. From this point on, upon your final death, your spirit will be reborn into a new body, conceived shortly after your death in the world you call home. The newborn will retain all of your abilities, though they will have to re-learn how to use each ability one-by-one, and they will be born with an innate talent for the next element in the Cycle (Air- Water-Earth-Fire) rather than the element you chose. They will also have the ability to call upon you, primarily as a spiritual adviser, but also as a source of power should they so require. However, they will have their own mind, which you cannot directly influence - your role in their life will be a mentor, and though their personality is guaranteed to not be one you disapprove of, in the end they will make their own choices. When they die, they will also take on the same role as you have, and will in turn be reincarnated, each life becoming a link in an endless chain far greater than the whole.,,
Wealth,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Free Noble%%%%You've come into a decent amount of money, whether in the form of Water Tribe beads, Fire Nation gold, or valuable trade goods. Once liquidated, you have enough to frugally for 10 years or lavishly for one, or enough to make a single major purchase, such as a horse and cart or fancy artwork. May be taken more that once; each additional purchase adds the same rough amount of money or goods. Nobles start with enough to live lavishly for five years, or make several major purchases.,,
Clothing,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Free All%%%%Even in the primitive jungles of the Foggy Swamp Tribe, running around in the nude is frowned upon. You start with a couple outfits from your Nation befitting your station in life, and may purchase as many additional outfits as your heart desires. Unlike the starting clothing, these are not limited to your Nation's apparel - pick anything from the simple saffron robes of an Air Nomad to the raiments of a Fire Nation noble, or even a suit of armor if you'd like.,,
Weaponry,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Free Warrior and Non-Benders%%%%From the simple Water Tribe Jaw-Blade to the twin Hook Swords developed by the Earth Kingdom, weaponry in the world of Avatar is varied and effective. Each purchase of this provides you with a single basic weapon (or a pair if they're used as a matched set), ranged or melee, as well as the appropriate accoutrements, and, if appropriate, a small stock of ammunition. Only individual weapons may be chosen; siege weapons are out of its purview.,,
Waterskins,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,Free Water Tribe%%%%Well-designed and heavy duty, this set of waterskins can easily hold several gallons of water, and are designed to evenly distribute them over your body for easy access. Aside from carrying a ready source of potable water on long travels, these skins provide a ready source for Waterbenders without a steady supply of their chosen element. These skins have a special blessing as well - each Full, Half, and New Moon, empty skins will refill themselves.,,
Clever Pet,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free Nomad%%%%It's lonely to travel by yourself, but this little guy (or gal) is just the thing to keep you company. An adorable flying lemur, a sleek pygmy puma, a fierce iguana parrot, or something else entirely - as long as it's between the size of a mouse and a large dog when fully grown, you may pick any of the myriad hybrid critters in the Avatar world as your pet. Your pet will be healthy, happy, and hardy, with a personality that suits you, and is clever enough to learn a variety of commands - and sometimes even understand you without them.,,
Set of Maps,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This combination of maps and guidebooks completely cover the Avatar world, giving you information about every major settlement, landmark, and natural feature you could potentially come across, as well as handy travel tips, such as local cuisine, celebrations, and things not to do unless you want to be executed. If you should somehow find yourself in another world, you will find your maps now cover it instead, with information current as of your very first visit.,,
Air Nomad Glider,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free Air Nomad%%%%Resembling a well-crafted bo staff at first glance, this staff has been constructed to unfold fan-like wings which enable the user to glide with it. While most users will only be able to glide for short distances, a skilled Airbender (or extremely skilled Firebender) can use it to truly fly. It also amplifies Bending when incorporated into most Bending forms, and can be used to fight with in a pinch.,,
Meteoric Ingot,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A large ingot of a strange, dark metal, not born of this world. Though difficult to work with, when this metal is shaped into a weapon or armor, it will prove worth the effort; it holds an extremely sharp, and is both featherweight and nigh-unbreakable. It responds all too easily to Earthbending, enabling even a beginner to shape it with minimal effort. At your option, you may instead purchase this pre-crafted into any melee weapon or light armor of your choice.,,
Master's Scroll,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A set of beautifully-illustrated scrolls, detailing everything from basic Bending techniques to complex and powerful forms that even a Genius would be hard-pressed to think up. Easy to learn from, patient study will increase any Bender's skill, though obviously a Novice will benefit far more. They also have another special property which few others know about; if a person who is neither a Bender nor born of any of the four Nations reads the scroll, they will gain the power to Bend that element. May be purchased more than once; extra purchases are at a discount.,,
Wind Sword,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Looking for all the world like nothing more than an empty hilt, the Air Sword is a rare but remarkable weapon designed by military-minded Air Nomads. Using Airbending, one can focus a gust of wind through the hilt, creating a razor sharp blade of wind that can cut through most materials with ease. Though designed for Airbenders, other Benders may learn how to use the Blade for their element as well, creating lethal swords of water, earth, or fire.,,
War Balloon,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Discount Fire Nation%%%%Though these balloons are experimental technology still in development, this design will be the final form settled on by the Fire Nation for its aerial warfare plans. It uses a furnace to generate hot air, though any skilled Firebender would make a far better substitute, and has enough space for ten very friendly people to squeeze on, as well as a payload for anything you'd care to drop. Be careful whose hands this falls into...,,
Tamed Shirshu,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,Discount Earth Nation%%%%Large as a bull, this creature resembles a hybrid of a dog and a star-nosed mole, with a venomous tongue which would put an anteater to shame. Its saliva is a potent paralytic, with a single strike instantly leaving its victim immobile. It also has an unearthly sense of smell, and can track prey halfway across the world once it catches their scent. Yours is quite well-trained, and will both respond to your commands and allow riders without complaint.,,
Original Master,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Discount Water Tribe%%%%The first Benders were not humans, but animals with deep understanding of their elements no human can match. You've gained a bond with one of these creatures, appropriate to your nation - Airbenders gain a Sky Bison calf, Earthbenders a Badgermole cub, and Firebenders a young Dragon. Each is still a child, though still large enough to ride, and will prove to be a loyal and powerful friend your entire life if cared for well. As the Water Tribe learned from the Moon and Sea, they will not gain an animal; instead, you gain a deep connection to these spirits. Aside from this enhancing your ability to learn Waterbending by watching the tides, you will find your waterskins full each night, and you will no longer lose power when the moon wanes, or even during a lunar eclipse. May be purchased more than once; additional purchases need not be a member of the same species as your Nation learned its art from, and will be at a discount.,,
Marked,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Whether the extensive tattoos of an Airbending Master or a gruesome burn scar across your face, you've been marked in an obvious way which serves to easily identify you unless you take significant steps to conceal it; casual clothing won't be enough. While this does not come with any notoriety per se, if you accumulate your own you'll need to conceal yourself to have any chance of blending in, and people may get suspicious if you wander around looking like you have something to hide.,,
Chakra Imbalance,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Your natural energies are out of balance, filling you with an excess of Yin or Yang, your choice. If you choose a Yin imbalance, you will find yourself sullen, making it hard to motivate yourself and difficult to feel happiness. On the other hand, if you choose a Yang imbalance, you will have too much energy, finding it hard to sit still or focus, as well as a truly furious temper. Though this imbalance may be treated, the imbalance will always return in time.,,
Blind,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You were born with milky eyes and incomplete optic nerves, unable to see even the slightest hint of light. Since this is a natural condition, it will be impossible to heal or cure in any way; the world of sight is absolutely lost to you. Though it is possible to rely on your other senses, it will take substantial training to even approach the world the same way as someone who can see, and some abilities will forever remain out of your grasp.,,
Pacifist,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The very idea of inflicting violence on another living being makes you uneasy. Actually harming someone, let alone killing them? Unthinkable. While you can still defend yourself or others, you'll do everything you can to avoid damaging strikes, instead relying on disabling and evading your enemies. Should you actually harm someone, you'll be overcome with grief, unable to function for a significant period of time. Bear in mind that this applies to all beings, not just humans - better get used to a vegetarian diet.,,
"My Cabbages!",,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Sometimes, you wonder if the Spirits cursed you. Any time there's trouble, it's heading straight for you - if a building gets burned, it'll be the one you're in, and if the police are chasing a fugitive, you're the one they're crashing into. Worse yet, trouble seems to spring up in even the most peaceful places aimed directly at you; somehow, the sleepy town you spend the night in will wind up raided by the Fire Nation, or flooded by a vengeful freedom fighter. This also extends to any possessions you may have; items you bought with CP are safe, but anything else probably won't last 10 years.,,
In Exile,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Whether you're a wanted criminal, or just made an enemy of someone very powerful, you've been banished from the Nation of your birth (or the Earth Kingdom if you're an Air Nomad) under penalty of death. Your sentence begins immediately, and while you'll be granted some leeway to leave if you're still there, if it looks like you're trying to stay you can expect to be driven out by force. News of your banishment will spread, and while some may look upon this banishment favorably, most will be reluctant to work with someone considered a dangerous criminal by their homeland.,,
Into The Inferno,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,As it turns out, your arrival on this world did not go unnoticed. Both Fire Lord Azulon and Prince Ozai received a vision of who you are and what you can do, and now consider you a serious threat.
