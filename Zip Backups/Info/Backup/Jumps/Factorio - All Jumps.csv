Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Origin,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This world is much like Earth, and has no exotic features beyond the very dangerous wildlife. You can pay 100cp to choose your starting location instead of rolling, and may also select the biome for the 'crash site' to be located in if you choose that option. Nothing prevents you from moving to a different biome during your time here, but that will require a great deal of time and effort, to say nothing of the danger posed by the locals. In greater or lesser amounts, every biome comes with a varied mix of the core Factorio resources - wood, stone, coal, iron, copper, uranium, oil, and water.%%%%1 - Grasslands Resources are scattered far and wide, but there is plenty of open space and few obstacles to expansion.%%%%2 - Forest Pollution is mitigated by the local flora, slowing the effects of industry upon the local wildlife. However, you'll need to do a lot of woodcutting if you want room to build.%%%%3 - Desert Uncomfortably hot, hostile wildlife slumbers during the day unless your factory complex is spectacularly disruptive. Food and water are sparse here.%%%%4 - Tundra The nights are long and freezing, forcing local wildlife to seek shelter at night unless something extreme drives them to action. Your machines may require extra attention for optimum performance.%%%%5 - Island chain Water is the one thing the local insectoids have never managed to completely adapt to. You'll be building a lot of bridges and space will be very tight, but hostile creatures exist only in isolated pockets.%%%%6 – Broken cliffs An area shaped by past tectonic upheaval, your surroundings are filled with natural barriers that will work just as well at keeping bugs at bay as they are at making it hard to expand. The terrain will dictate where and how you build unless you put great effort into re-shaping it for your purposes.%%%%7 - Free choice Select a biome of your choice to start in. You may not choose 'crash site.'%%%%8 - Crash site Instead of landing in an emergency pod, your ship stayed in one piece long enough to carry you down. It's damaged far beyond your ability to repair with what you have here, but the wreck will provide shelter and an abundance of valuable salvage that will allow you to get set up much faster. Roll again, ignoring a result of 8, to determine which biome your ship landed in.,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You wake as your pod slams onto the surface of Nauvis. It's a whole new world, and you're alone but for any companions that accompanied you. While you wait for a rocket to be built, there should be plenty of time to explore and learn about this place...provided you don't die.,,
Soldier,,0,,00,,False,,False,,As a ground-pounder or navy armsman, you were tasked with the defence of your fellow man. Skilled with weapons and the necessary technical skills to maintain them, you take a very direct approach to problem solving.,,
Engineer,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You've got to get off this rock before the local nasties bite/claw/melt your face off. Good thing you have the tools and the talent to build machines to handle any problem this world throws at you.,,
Hive,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Wait, what? This isn't right. Instead of looking up at an unfamiliar sky after prying yourself free from your crashed spacecraft, you awaken to strange and alien senses. You are a hive, a massive, sessile organism that spawns biters, spitters and worms to defend you and gather food. Instead of building a base as humans do, you'll harvest biomass to fuel the growth of secondary hives to spread your area of control and increase your capacity to spawn minions. Only the death of your core colony will end your chain. The rest are expendable. If you rolled 'crash site' for your starting location you instead start with a large number of secondary hives and your spawns begin tougher than normal. Instead of trying to build a rocket, you must fend off rival hives and colonists trying to clear away hostile life-forms.,,
Drop In - Got Everything?,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It's a big world out there, and it would be annoying (and possibly fatal) to head out without having everything you need on hand.%%%%You have a mental checklist of sorts that automatically forms whenever you set out on a task that keeps track of all the things you need to bring with you or retrieve. Whether that's ammunition and fuel for a military excursion, materials for building a new section of your factory or just food and sundries, it's all tracked.%%%%If you try to start your trip without the things you know you need, you'll get a mental alarm warning you that you're short something. You can set the checklist to always track certain things, if you want to always remember to have something on hand, or set it to track a category of things. The latter will make sure you'll never forget to bring 'a weapon' or 'a way to keep in touch' when you head into dangerous areas.,,
Drop In - Mr. Fusion,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your body brims with 750kW of electrical body at all times. It can be transferred wirelessly to power nearby machines and the output will automatically adjust itself to cause no damage. Yes, this means that you can't just discharge it all to fry anything that annoys you, but that's still enough juice for a suit of powered armor and a host of upgrades, a vehicle or two or several large local machines. With enough tinkering you could learn how to pour this power into your electrical grid, and if you get really creative you could slap together some kind of lightning gun to let you use this perk's power offensively. On your own, the range of transmission is quite short. Only five meters.,,
Drop In - Enemy Radar,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You have a sixth sense that warns of hostile intent. Predatory animals and wantonly destructive entities always ping on this sense. Thinking beings can ping this sense if they are generally malicious or desire you harm specifically. The range of this sense is about a kilometer, and you know the general direction and distance of the source of hostility.,,
Drop In - Tech Tree,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Science is a messy process, requiring the study of dozens of disparate phenomena, looking for patterns, finding ways to use that information to build stuff that incorporates what you've learned, and then mashing it all together to get an 'invention.' Now you can take some of the guesswork out of it.%%%%When you desire to build something, you have an instinctive sense for how to go about making that thing a reality. Want to get a rocket into orbit? You'll know what factors you need to focus on when working on the math needed and what kinds of materials you have (or don't have) that would be the best fit for the conditions it'll be put through on its journey.%%%%If you are completely lacking knowledge of a subject or phenomena, then you'll still know where to start studying to refine the tools that will lead you to a new field of study that will help you make a new set of tools, and so on, and so on. Keep in mind that it may take you a very, very long time to create new fields of SCIENCE entirely on your own.,,
Soldier - Siege Mentality,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It's not paranoia when there really are things out there that want to eat your face. You have the know-how to develop effective static defences.%%%%You know the best places to build walls and place traps, how to maximize the coverage of your defences, how to slow attackers and channel them into your lines of fire, and how to make people regret trying to follow you as you fall back to secondary positions.%%%%Never lose a tower defence game again.,,
Soldier - Ten Points,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have a fine-tuned Kinesthetic sense for any vehicle you take control of, very quickly understanding its capabilities and how it handles.%%%%Badly-tuned or damaged controls are never an obstacle to precise operation. And just for fun, the vehicle will do a great deal more damage, and take far less damage in return, when used to ram or run over an enemy.,,
Soldier - Aimbot,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,No amount of gun will help if you can't hit your target, and that's going to be hard when running like hell from a swarm of biters. Now, no matter what, your gun will stay pointed at your target as long as you are physically capable of doing so. Run, jump, roll, scramble, it won't matter, your gun's barrel will snap back to point at what you want to shoot the split-second it's able to.%%%%While your aim and skill with firearms are exceptional, perfect accuracy is not guaranteed. Trying to fire a machine gun one-handed while aiming at something behind you and running at a dead sprint means you're going to miss a lot, but at least the bullets will always be headed in the right direction.,,
Soldier - Just Another Gun,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,With a glance you know how something can be modified to become a weapon, or fine-tune an existing weapon to become even more destructive. It's just as easy to adjust weapons for different environments and situations.%%%%There is nothing you cannot weaponize, and when an enemy comes into sight you'll know how effective your weapons will be against them. You may not know exactly why, or how long it'll stay effective, but you'll always know if you brought the right tool for the job.,,
Engineer - Run the Numbers,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Mining rigs produce a certain amount of resources per hour, which travel along conveyors at a certain speed, and a certain number are consumed by assembly machines at a certain rate, varying for each product as determined by the construction time and the loading and unloading speed of the inserters. That's a lot of math, but you can handle it.%%%%You can juggle dozens of numbers in your head without forgetting anything, and your brain now has the equivalent of a built-in scientific calculator to perfectly solve any mundane equation you can throw at it. You'll also get a crash course in advanced mathematics and the know-how to create those equations you'll need solved.,,
Engineer - The Conveyors will Run on Time,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Or you could let a computer do all the work. You have the programming skills needed to automate a massive assembly complex, having dozens, even hundreds of disparate machines working smoothly together.%%%%Your skill is enough to program 'fuzzy' logic into your machines.%%%%This is far from actual sapience, but they will know not to waste energy or compound problems by blindly following irrelevant, contradictory or self-destructive programming.%%%%Your defensive systems also work more intelligently, leading targets, prioritizing more dangerous enemies based on the current situation, and not being distracted by decoys.,,
Engineer - Green Machine,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You have a knack for wringing every little bit of efficiency out of a system as possible. You can get your machines to produce less waste, consume less energy, and work just a little bit faster.%%%%On a larger scale, you know how to create a well-organized factory complex that makes efficient use of space, your conveyor system minimizing transport time and is free of bottlenecks, and you easily account for future expansion when planning things out.,,
Engineer - Bamboo Technology,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,It's hard enough to build something as complex as a rocket without advanced synthetic materials and rare earth metals for maximum performance.%%%%You know how to push the mechanical limits of the most common elements through creative means to construct things far past what should be possible, allowing you to construct high-tech devices with low-tech materials.%%%%You could easily build something on par with the main battle tanks of the 21st century with iron plates and cheap plastic, powered by coal. Just don't try to build your rocket out of actual bamboo.,,
Hive - Pheromone Control,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your olfactory senses are greatly heightened, allowing you to easily perceive things ordinary humans would call odorless or tasteless.%%%%This is needed now that you have control over your own pheromone production. You can selectively exude scents that subtly influences those that pick them up, inducing such responses as intimidation or arousal, among other things.%%%%Pheromones offer little in the way of nuance, but can be used to communicate simple concepts to those creatures with equally sensitive olfactory senses which is how hives control the creatures they spawn.,,
Hive - Genetic Imprinting,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,While all hives have a nearly-unbreakable hold over the simple brains of the creatures they spawn, this influence is now expanded to include anything that bears your DNA.%%%%Your children and any other biological entity formed at least partially from your DNA will never fail to recognize you as their progenitor, while you will always know your own.%%%%This connection can see through all but the most elaborate and complex disguises and deceptions, and strengthens any other perks you may have that apply to your progeny.,,
Hive - Absolute Proprioception,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You always know where your body is or if anything is missing or got moved around. Sounds unimpressive?%%%%Well now this sense extends to all of your 'self' even when that self isn't in one piece and some of your bits have wandered off somewhere. Like biters. Or your children. (And won't that be an uncomfortable talk? Maybe just don't tell them.)%%%%Anyways, anything that has your DNA, that was a part of you or formed inside/of your tissue, will ping on your awareness so long as it's alive. Since you're still aware of all your meat-bits naturally you can still control them, but only as much as their structure allows.%%%%Severed arms can be made to flex, and still feed you information from their sense of touch, but they can't see anything and blood loss means they'll soon fully die.%%%%You can't exert control over bits of yourself with greater than animal-level intelligence.,,
Hive - Stress Evolution,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,New arrivals to Nauvis find that the most dangerous trait of the local wildlife is to rapidly evolve and grow stronger in response to their attacks, and that gift is now yours.%%%%You will slowly but perfectly regenerate from any damage you suffer. As you heal, your body will adapt, restructure and refine itself to make improvements and counters to whatever injured you. Skin grows back thicker and muscles bulge with new tissue. Even stress from overwork will trigger this response, as overtaxed acid glands are pumped full of hormones to encourage development while filtration and digestion organs become more efficient when exposed to toxins and pollutants.%%%%As hive or human, these improvements will be automatically passed to any spawn or children you produce. This perk will only improve upon what already exists. It will never create new structures within your body, overspecialize one part of your body at cost to the rest of your bodily functions or mutate you into an entirely new form of life.%%%%Though it will be a long way off, you will eventually find the limit to how much your current body can be improved.,,
Items,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Hives gain their own version of certain items. Post-jump, they may choose to keep the organic variant they acquire or swap it out for the technological version humans get. The choice is final.,,
Guns,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your personal sidearm won't stay effective for very long, so you'll begin with one of the following weapons: A submachine gun, an automatic shotgun, a rocket launcher, or a flamethrower.%%%%Each of these are compact, reliable, and light on weight and recoil. They have unlimited ammunition, and will reappear in your warehouse a day after being lost or destroyed. They use the most advanced ammunition available here, but no nukes. You may purchase this item multiple times.%%%%For Hives this item manifests as their worms and spitters having an alternate form of expectoration beyond 'single glob of acid.',,
Tasty Fish,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,The only form of life on Nauvis that isn't trying to kill you. These fish are fat, lazy, and perfectly edible, though you may get bored of them after a few years. It seems like a few can be found in any suitable body of water when you're hungry and they can be safely eaten raw in a pinch.%%%%They won't really become a part of the ecosystem if you don't want them to, and you can choose for them to stay a part of the world or vanish when you leave your current jump.,,
Nauvis Brand Petshop,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have a tame, perfectly loyal biter following you around. It's only a little one now, but it will eventually grow much larger just by basking in your factory's pollution thanks to 'stress evolution.'%%%%Affectionate and playful, but the hard shell makes cuddling difficult. On the other hand, if you'd prefer you can begin with a flying capsule with a 'aimbot' perk and a laser equivalent to what your turrets carry. It will float silently above you at all times, firing immediately at anything showing hostility towards you within its range.%%%%Both are fully healed or repaired 24 hours after injury or death. Counts as a follower, and you may buy this perk twice to get both.,,
Body Bank,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,As they age, satellite hives are added to the main mass, preventing the 'death' of that hive cluster so long as one of them survives. You'll find a copy of your current body hanging in a cocoon in the corner of the cosmic warehouse. With a touch, your mind and soul transfers into this empty shell while your old body quickly corrodes away into nothingness.%%%%Even the most virulent mundane or mystical afflictions will never transfer over, being destroyed along with your old body.%%%%Growing a new body is a very slow process, taking about a year, and this cannot be sped up.%%%%You can only have one spare body at a time.,,
Buggy,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A very reliable ATV with an engine capable of processing anything combustible. Wood chips, coal, crude oil...just dump it in and turn the key, but keep in mind that cheap and unrefined fuel means less performance.%%%%On the other hand, the better the fuel, the better the performance. Shove in literal rocket fuel to give the engine a major boost, but please remember that there really is such a thing as 'too much power.'%%%%The buggy also comes with a 360-degree machine gun turret and unlimited ammo. If lost or destroyed, it will reappear in your warehouse or vehicle bay after 24 hours.%%%%%%Hives who purchase this item receive a perfectly normal buggy as described above, except that your biters and spitters will somehow have no problem driving it, aiming and firing the gun, and loading the trunk and fuel tank with items and biomass they collect.,,
Nauvis Encounter Suit,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,Free for all except Hive%%%%A lightly-armored and environmentally sealed suit, designed to keep the wearer alive in a wide variety of alien environments. On-board recycling systems will allow you to go for days without outside sources of food, water, and oxygen, and the suit is designed to be worn comfortably for an equal amount of time.%%%%The main draw of this armor is the fabrication system, allowing you to produce a wide assortment of components and tools as long as you can provide materials and blueprints. The system works slowly and can't produce large items, but the biggest items already in the databanks are designed to be built in pieces and assembled with the included handheld tools.%%%%The suit is also highly modular, easily installing and integrating new attachments like the power systems, armor and add-ons you'll build you. You may import an existing suit of armor you already own to gain these qualities.,,
Hive Seed,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,Free for Hive%%%%This fleshy lump, when planted in an appropriate spot, will slowly grow into a hive and begin spawning biters to begin foraging for biomass. As the hive grows, it will eventually spawn worms - some will be mobile, while others will burrow into the ground a short distance away and grow to become immobile acid-spitting defenders. The hive and its spawns instinctively recognize you as master, but you won't be able to issue commands without the Pheromone Control perk or more exotic means of communication.%%%%After several months of good growth, biters will eventually be sent out with eggs to create new hive clusters, which will later spawn more hives in turn. Each such subordinate hive will also recognize you as master. You receive one hive seed per jump.,,
Factorio Database,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A bulky data storage device containing the blueprints and software needed to construct and run all of Factorio's machines, weapons, buildings, and vehicles. The information goes all the way down, providing everything from the tools you need to build better tools and the formulas and processes for every chemical and process involved at every step of the way, from stone age to space age. Whether Hive or human, the database also includes detailed biological scans of Nauvis lifeforms.,,
Rocket Silo,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This massive facility will follow you between jumps, planting itself in a location of your choice. It is completely automated and contains banks of computers and assemblers dedicated to creating rockets and delivering payloads into orbit. All you need to provide it with are the needed materials.%%%%It can easily interface with outside technology and can act as a massive, supercharged assembly machine if you want to use if for building things other than a rocket. You may import an existing factory, facility or building into this role to combine and expand their functions.%%%%%%A Hive that purchases this item gains a supercharged critter spawner for the duration of their time here, producing stronger creatures faster than a Hive can normally put out.,,
Monster Project,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A massive artillery piece, this gun can slowly (very, very, very slowly) crawl around and can be supported by a single factorio-grade rail track if you want this crazy thing mobile.%%%%With a range of about fifty kilometers, the emplacement has its own built-in radar and the ability to automatically track and fire at hostile targets within range, but getting any real kind of accuracy beyond just a few km will require a spotter, additional radar coverage, and manual targeting.%%%%The weapon produces its own shells at a rate of one per day, and can hold fifteen by itself at most. You may import an existing ranged weapon to gain a ludicrously-large artillery emplacement version alt-form.%%%%%%If you are a Hive, you instead gain a massive worm capable of slinging explosive globs of acid at similar ranges and conditions, and may import a suitable follower to gain being a giant acid-spitting defence-worm-hybrid-tower version of itself as an alt-form.,,
Spidertron,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,SPIDERTRON! What else is there to say?%%%%A massive dieselpunk arachnid with telescoping limbs able to traverse cliffs and walk through forests with its body above the canopy, four rocket launchers, able to be piloted remotely, and fully compatible with all accessories normally fitted into power armor. It's a beast, plain and simple.%%%%While not invincible, there are only a few things on Nauvis that are a threat to a fully-equipped Spidertron, and if you don't let the power go to your head you should be able to stay safe.%%%%This Spidertron doesn't come with extra equipment, but it does have a replenishing supply of rockets and returns in full repair a day after damage or loss.%%%%%%Hives gain the ability to make one of their worms undergo chrysalis, becoming a giant spider monster with rapid-fire acid-spit and power comparable to Spidertron.%%%%This...Spidermorph?...does not have equipment slots, but in exchange it will mutate to better fit whatever situations it finds itself in, gaining a thicker carapace, faster movement, more powerful acid, or some other improvements that it will swap in and out as needed just like modular equipment.,,
Warehouse Attachement - Provider Chest,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Whenever you open this space-bending chest you'll find an assortment of the standard Factorio resources ready for processing. A variety of mundane wood and stone, pressed coal, iron and copper ingots, uranium slugs in heavy lead containers, and barrels of oil and water.%%%%The chest produces an unlimited amount of each resource at varying rates.%%%%Water, stone, wood and coal are plentiful, metals and oil enough to feed a half-dozen high-end assembly machines with all the enhancing modules, and enough uranium to provide for a single nuclear reactor. This might sound like a lot, but here it really isn't. Still, it will get you started nicely and being easily moved around it will make setting up in new locations very easy.,,
Warehouse Attachement - Roboport,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A tablet that always returns to you after being lost or destroyed controls a small fleet of robots that fly out of a hatch in the cosmic warehouse's ceiling. These drones can move small items and will work together to carry up to a ton at a time, and have tools that allow for simple constructions to be performed if you provide the system with digital blueprints.%%%%The drones can range a kilometer from the door to the cosmic warehouse, but can link up with constructed roboports to extend their range. The robots vanish if the warehouse door closes.%%%%The robots can draw from both normal and warehouse versions of the provider chests.,,
Crew,,3,,-2000,,False,,False,,You may import up to 8 companions. If you take a human origin, they may be any other origin that would leave them human. If you are a Hive, they must be Hives as well. Companions gain a budget of 400cp to spend.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Maximum of 600 CP,,
Rough Terrain,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,An impediment to travel and construction, you'll need some impressive architectural skills, a lot of earth moving, or a very convoluted resource transfer system to get any real use out of the landscape.%%%%%%Hives find that the surface of Nauvis is now a patchwork of lakes and rivers.,,
Flesh Carpet,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,When you arrived, somehow you triggered a unique mutation among the insectoids. Tendrils creep out of each hive, corrupting local flora into fleshy parodies and creating a sprawling pseudo-hive. The range and sensitively of the hives to pollution is now much larger.%%%%%%Hives find that every human now has some kind of personal radar, preventing them from blundering into your bases and warning colonies of incoming spawn attacks without fail.,,
Water Wings,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Water is the one thing that the insectoids have never managed to overcome. With the weight of their shells and structure of their lungs, submersion is quickly fatal. Now they will eventually overcome this limitation, removing the natural barriers that inhibit their movement and expansion.%%%%%%Hives are plagued with bad luck during any attempt to dam, bridge, or otherwise create easy solutions to dealing with water barriers. Your spawn's problems with water can never be removed, even with out-of-jump abilities.,,
Failed Colony,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Someone was here before you, and they made a mess...and then they were eaten. While some infrastructure remains to be salvaged, the local wildlife starts out at a much higher evolutionary level.%%%%%%Hives find themselves near a large and well-armed colony.,,
Resource Poor,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Resources are sparse, the fields few and far between. You'll be hard-pressed to maintain a steady influx of needed materials, and your supply lines will need protecting.%%%%Hives will find edible biomass in perpetually short supply, stunting hive growth and spawning rates.,,
Bug Lives Matter,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,At some point here you will destroy a hive and discover that they are an integral part of the world's ecosystem. If you destroy too many of them, Nauvis' biosphere will collapse and everything on it will die, which may well include you. You can only weather the hive's attacks for the duration of your time here, as there is no way to get them to stop attacking.%%%%Hives have discovered that humans and human accessories are mighty tasty, and consuming them fuels their evolution. With so many humans trying to land here and few of them coming prepared other hives have gotten a massive power boost and are threatening to consume the others. You must shepard your local humans, basking in the smog and nibbling on the occasional stray without letting them all die. Without humans of your own, other hives will overpower you.,,
Extreme Environments,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Machines overheat to destruction in the desert. The frigid tundra turns metal brittle enough to shatter under strain. Constant hurricanes, tsunami, earthquakes...no matter where you go, something will make your life very difficult on a regular basis. In some cases, this is just as detrimental to the insectoids...until they adapt.%%%%%%Hives suffer just as much from local conditions, and spawns can never fully adapt to them. Colonists will eventually find ways to harden their machines against the environment.,,
Clever Girl,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Insectoids normally mob the target of their ire, to overwhelm it with claw and mandible. Now their intelligence grows with their strength. They will test your defences, learn your tactics, and if outmatched, send word to other hives to gather additional forces.%%%%%%Hives find it impossible to give their minions any instruction much more complex than 'go kill that.',,
A Left Turn at Chiron,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Perhaps Nauvis is sibling to another world in the galaxy with its own version of horrors. Now Hives have a presence in both the sea and sky. Aquatic Hives swim on the waves and spawn amphibious versions of biters and spitters, escorted by powerful worm-ships. Buoyant Hives float on the wind, sending swarms of flying creatures to harvest biomass from the ground. Blueprints for the watercraft and aircraft you'd need to chase these hives down are not, however, in the database.%%%%%%Hives discover that colonists now have access to simple ships and aircraft, which they will use to travel quickly and strike against you while staying out of harm's (your) way.,,
Megahive,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Normally, Hive clusters are spread far and wide. Now it is rare that insectoids break away to form new nests. The majority of Hive clusters are massive in size, and the thousands of insectoids inhabiting each area will move as one the moment you draw their ire.%%%%%%Hives grow satellite hives at an extremely slow rate, limiting what they have to work with and making the loss of even one a major setback.,,
Unlimited Evolution,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The insectoids are no longer limited by their genetics. Now they'll eventually adapt to anything you expose them to. Fire? Biological weapons? Magic? Psionics? Giant robots? Barriers of twisted space-time? The insectoids will develop new forms and capabilities to overcome whatever obstacles you put in their way. Apply your arsenal sparingly, or your doom will be one of your own making. Adaptations slowly spread to every Hive on Nauvis, not just the ones you attack.%%%%%%Hives cannot use out-of-jump abilities to modify themselves or their minions, or to use other methods to control them besides pheromones.,,
Reinventing the Wheel,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,All powers and perks from outside this jump are locked, and your warehouse is sealed. You must successfully craft a satellite, insert it into a working rocket, and launch it into a stable orbit. You have 10 years to succeed. Fail, and your chain is over. As purchasing the 'Factorio database' would almost completely remove the challenge of this drawback, the most advanced technology this item will give you is oil processing and everything below that on the tech tree.%%%%%%Hives must face an organized colonization attempt and the systematic destruction of hostile life- forms is underway. With all out-of-jump powers and your warehouse sealed, you must kill every human on the planet within ten years or at least prevent them from advancing far enough in technology and industry to establish an orbital presence. If they manage that, you will be bombarded from on high with no chance of survival, and your chain will end.,,
