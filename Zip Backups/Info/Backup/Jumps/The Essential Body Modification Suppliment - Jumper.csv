Starting CP,,6,,1000,,True,,False,,,,
Body Mod Mode,,6,,00,,False,,False,,This mode allows this document to be used similarly to other Body Mod supplements. You start with 100 EP and a single Essence. You can’t get more EP after your initial build, but you can train up any of your perks through sufficient effort.,,
Baseline Mode,,6,,1000,,True,,False,,This mode starts you with 100 EP, a single Essence, and you can only gain EP through purchasing perks with CP per the EP-Granting Perks section, below. This is roughly balanced against other Body Mod supplements at the start and should increase at a manageable rate from there.,,
Mundane Start Mode,,6,,00,,False,,False,,This mode starts you with no EP and no Essence. You can gain up to 100 EP per Jump by doing quests, or through purchasing perks with CP per the EP-Granting Perks section, below. Once you have purchased all of the 50 EP perks associated with one Essence, you may unlock that Essence, getting an immediate rebate of EP and receiving discounts on future purchases normally. This mode starts lower than the other modes but increases slightly faster if quests are completed regularly.,,

Basic - Cosmetic Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You may freely reshape your body into any configuration that occurs naturally for your species or requires only minor cosmetics assistance (makeup, hair dye, contacts). Heights can range from half a meter to three meters with proportionate weight between twenty five kilos and five hundred kilos and sufficient strength to move normally.%%%%This change can make you as attractive as the most attractive model wearing the most skillfully applied makeup, but does not confer any supernatural benefits.%%%%You may make these alterations when you first receive this perk and may make the adjustments again between jumps.,,
Basic - Physical Health Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You are cured of any physical and genetic issues and will not suffer from many common issues, such as cancer, as you age.%%%%At will, you may also choose to have your body’s digestive and other systems function more effectively, removing your need for sanitary facilities to dispose of waste.%%%%You may also start or stop the growth on any or all parts of your body.,,
Basic - Cosmetic Reconfiguration,,1,,00,,True,,True,,If you wish, you may greatly alter the shape of your body, including adding new appendages, reconfiguring existing appendages, adding scales or fur, and even adding wings. If you want to look like a horse, an angel, a demon, or a tentacle monster, you may do so.%%%%Entirely physical advantages, such as sharp claws, gills, or echolocation can be added or removed, though they will usually necessitate adjustments to your biology to make them work properly. Your longest dimension should stay within the height range of Cosmetic Refinement as should your weight.%%%%Based on your new physiology, adjust your “peak” attributes appropriately, though “peak human” should still be the average. For instance, a horse might have a higher speed and strength but be less agile and flexible. A tentacle monster might be impossibly flexible and agile but much slower. Functional wings require a real-world weight-to-wing-area ratio.%%%%At your discretion, you may choose to officially change your species to something other than human as part of this adjustment.%%%%As with Cosmetic Refinement, you may make these changes when you first receive this perk and again between jumps.,,
Basic - Physical Prowess Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,If below that level, your health and fitness increases to that of an average active, healthy person in their prime.%%%%Your physical fitness level will not deteriorate over time or through disuse, as long as your basic needs are met. You can perform at approximately half of peak performance as described in the Notes section.%%%%This level of fitness can be improved through training, but without perks cannot exceed peak capabilities for your base-form species.,,
Basic - Reproductive Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,If below that level, you become as fertile as an average member of your species and gain the ability to render yourself infertile or fertile at will.%%%%You may also choose to stop or start any menstrual or breeding cycle at will. If you carry the child, the pregnancy and birth will be easy and risk-free.%%%%Finally, your offspring will benefit from the Physical Health, Physical Prowess, Reproductive, Mental Health, and Mental Awareness Refinements. The cosmetic appearance of their physical form will be determined by the genetics of their parents at the time of conception normally.,,
Basic - Mental Health Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,If below that level, your mental health increases to that of an average person in sound mental health.%%%%You are resistant (but not immune) to developing issues such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression.%%%%You do not have issues with self-motivation or the ennui that living for centuries may cause.,,
Basic - Mental Awareness Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of any mental illnesses or other issues that you are suffering from.%%%%While this does not remove those issues, it does tell you how to best deal with them, making therapy dramatically more efficient and providing a degree of leverage in coping with them.,,
Basic - Spiritual Awareness Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,By spending a moment in quiet contemplation, you may become aware of the state of your own soul, including any outside influences upon it or damage it has suffered.%%%%If all or part of your soul is no longer in your possession, you also gain a vague idea of where it is located and who is currently holding it.%%%%This does not allow for removal of those influences, but it does give you an idea of where to start.,,
Basic - Spiritual Resource Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You may use all forms of non-physical energy interchangeably, effectively removing your need to track resources for individual types of powers.%%%%Whether this means that you can cast spells using chakra, perform martial arts using psionic power points, or some other combination is up to you.,,
Basic - Secondary Powers Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You automatically gain any ‘secondary powers’ required for your other abilities to function. For instance, if you have an ability that lets you run at supersonic speeds, you automatically gain a secondary ability that keeps you from tearing yourself apart while using it.%%%%In short, this ability allows you to function by comic book physics as needed to make your other abilities make sense.,,
Basic - Morality Refinement,,1,,00,,True,,False,,You may, at the time you gain this trait, choose to shift your moral compass in whatever way you desire. Do you want to be able to make hard decisions without flinching? Do you want to feel compassion for everyone though you normally can’t? Now is your chance to make that change.%%%%Once this perk has been used, your moral compass can only be altered in the normal ways (time and effort, perks, magic, divine intervention, etc.).,,
Essences,,6,,00,,False,,False,,You gain access to Essences through your mode. Each Essence provides a 50% discount on perks that refer to it and gives you several 50 EP perks for free. Refer to the Free Stuff List near the end of this document for a handy collection of those items.,,

Physical - Prowess I to III,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your body performs better than normal. This affects all physical attributes, including strength, speed, endurance, agility, coordination, flexibility, and healing rate.%%%%I: Peak human performance.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Bru/Sup/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Exp/Ele/Dru - 50 EP%%%%II: x2 peak human performance.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Bru/Sup/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Exp/Ele/Dru - 100 EP%%%%III: x5 peak human performance. You effectively no longer need to sleep.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Bru/Sup/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Exp/Ele/Dru - 200 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Physical - Resistance I to III,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your body resists negative effects.%%%%I: You are immune to normal diseases, parasites, bacteria, toxins, and the degenerative effects of radiation.%%Dsc: War/Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea/Ele/Dru - 50 EP%%%%II: You are immune to the items listed in tier I, regardless of origin. When you are injured, the injury is approximately 25% less than it would be otherwise. You also have a high pain tolerance.%%Dsc: War/Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea/Ele/Dru - 100 EP%%%%III: As tier II, but your resistance to damage increases to 50%. You are also, at your discretion, resistant to effects that would mutate or alter your form.%%Dsc: War/Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea/Ele/Dru - 200 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Physical - Reduced Sustenance I to III,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Your basic needs are dramatically less than those of another being.%%%%I: Your need for sustenance is reduced to half of normal.%%Dsc: Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Bea/Exp/Hea/Ele/Dru - 50 EP%%%%II: As tier I, plus you may now subsist on a much broader category of material than normal. For instance, a human might be able to live by grazing on rough plants or a vampire that normally requires the blood of humans may survive on animal blood or even wine (which is the “blood of the vine”). This ability also confers immunity to diseases, poisons, and other hazards coming from consumed items.%%Dsc: Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Bea/Exp/Hea/Ele/Dru - 100 EP%%%%III: As tier II, but you no longer need to consume food or drink at all, though you may do so if you wish to.%%Dsc: Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Exp/Hea/Ele/Dru - 200 EP,,Purchased in the Control Jump
Physical - Environmental Tolerance I and II,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You are not damaged by hazardous environments, though this does not provide you a method of propulsion.%%%%I: You no longer need to breathe and do not suffer from temperatures between -100C and +100C (-150F to +200F). You are immune to most radiation (up to about 1,000 mSv - the amount experienced during unshielded exposure to space).%%Dsc: Cra/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Sha/Exp/Ele - 50 EP%%%%II: As tier I, plus you do not suffer from temperatures below 1500C ( +2700F) or the effects of pressure lower than 1000 atmospheres (including the effects of vacuum). You are immune to the effects of radiation at all levels.%%Dsc: Cra/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Sha/Exp/Ele - 100 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Physical - Regeneration I to II,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your body heals quickly. Injuries that do not kill you outright (typically by destroying your brain) can be recovered from with no scarring (unless scarring is desired). This healing is automatic and does not require your conscious activation. Approximate healing times are as follows:%%%%I: Minor wounds (minutes), Major wounds (hours), Severed limbs (days).%%Dsc: War/Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Sha/Kng/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea/Dru - 100 EP%%%%II: Minor (seconds), Major (minutes), Severed limbs (hours).%%Dsc: War/Mdr/Ass/Bru/Sup/Lch/Vam/Sha/Kng/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea/Dru - 200 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Physical - Ageless I to II,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You do not age or otherwise degenerate over time in the normal manner:%%%%I: Double the lifespan for your race, with peak performance and health throughout. This benefit is applied retroactively in jumps where your starting age would put you past your physical prime.%%Dsc: Mdr/Arc/Bru/Lch/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Hea/Ele/Dru - 50 EP%%%%II: As I, but you will never die of old age and will maintain peak performance and health with no degeneration forever. You may choose to halt or resume your visible aging at any time.%%Dsc: Mdr/Bru/Lch/Vam/Sha/Bea/Dra/Hea/Ele/Dru - 100 EP,,
Physical - Elemental Physiology,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Choose an element that you are tied to closely.%%%%I: Your body is no longer entirely mortal and now includes portions that are elemental in nature. You may choose what this looks like cosmetically, from having flaming hair to rocky skin. By default, you still need to consume sustenance, though the form may vary by your elemental type - or it can remain regular food and drink. The primary benefit of this perk is that you have a non-standard anatomy. Attacks which rely on damage to specific organs or to vulnerable bits in general fail unless the attack has been specifically adapted to unique composition. This doesn’t make you otherwise harder to damage, it just moves the vulnerable bits around or changes their composition in strange ways.%%Dsc: Ele - 50 EP%%%%II to V: Your body becomes even more elemental in nature. Choose an element. In addition to the effects of tier I, you gain 400 EP (tier II); 600 EP (tier III); 800 EP (tier IV); or 1000 EP (tier V) to spend on abilities associated with that element below. While these EP are part of your base form, the abilities purchased with these EP are treated as any other for purposes of determining access within Gauntlets.%%Dsc: Ele%% - All: Elemental Resistance (by type); Energy Projection (by type); Material Creation (by type); Kinesis (by type)%% - Non-Solid Elements (Air, Fire): Flight; Intangible Form I; Energy Drain (by type)%% - Semi-Solid Elements (Water): Morphic Form; Intangible Form I; Energy Drain (by type)%% - Solid Elements (Earth/Metal): Physical Prowess; Physical Resistance; Regeneration; Enlarged Form,,
Physical - Undead Physiology,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You are no longer among the living.%%%%I: You choose how your undeath manifests cosmetically, from being a walking skeleton to a vampire that is almost human, though you must retain at least one vital organ whose destruction counts as an instantly fatal blow. You still need to consume sustenance, though the form of this will vary by the nature of your undeath. Vampires typically drink blood, zombies eat flesh, and liches consume magical energy. This sustenance is as appetizing to you as regular food to a human, though you may find that some examples taste better or worse than others (such as a vampire preferring the blood of certain people). You also age, though this deterioration is rarely the same as mundane mortal grey hairs.%%Dsc: Lch/Vam - 50 EP%%%%II to V: In addition to the effects of tier I, you gain 400 EP (tier II); 600 EP (tier III); 800 EP (tier IV); or 1000 EP (tier V) to spend on abilities associated with your type of undead, below. While these EP are part of your base form, the abilities purchased with these EP are treated as any other for purposes of determining access within Gauntlets.%%Dsc: Lch/Vam%% - All: Physical Resistance, Environmental Tolerance%% - Vampire: Physical Prowess, Heightened Senses, Intangible Form I, Bodily Reinforcement Techniques, Kinesis (blood only), Energy Drain%% - Lich: Mental Prowess, Supernatural Resource Recovery, Cheat Death, Minion Creation, Energy Drain,,
Physical - Creature Soul I to V,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Choose a form for the creature that lives inside you. This can be a regular animal, a dragon, a fantastic beast, a tentacle monster, or a never-before-seen creature of your own imagination.%%%%I: At will, you may manifest physical attributes associated with your chosen creature. These manifestations can range from fur or scales to fangs and claws. These changes can have the logical benefits of the new anatomy (being able to slip through restraints or small openings, sharp claws that work as natural weapons, or appropriately sized wings allowing you to fly. As part of these shifts, you may adjust your “peak” performance parameters, with any increases having offsetting decreases. For instance, a boost to speed might result in a lowered flexibility or agility. In general, you should not be able to gain supernatural advantages through these shifts.%%Dsc: Bea/Dra - 50 EP%%%%II: As tier I, plus your changes may be more extensive. You may assume a second base form that exemplifies your chosen creature. This change takes a second of concentration and is available even in situations where you are normally restricted to your base form. Your form’s characteristics follow the same guidelines as the Cosmetic Reconfiguration perk.%%Dsc: Bea/Dra - 100 CP%%%%III to V: Your bond with your chosen creature grows. In addition to the effects of tier II, you gain 600 EP (tier III); 800 EP (tier IV); or 1000 EP (tier V) to spend on abilities from those associated with your chosen form. Dragons should also choose an elemental association which will govern the types of abilities they may select. While these EP are part of your base form, the abilities purchased with these EP are treated as any other for purposes of determining access within Gauntlets.%%Dsc: Bea/Dra%% - All: Physical Prowess, Physical Resistance, Tooth and Claw, Flight (only for creatures that fly), Form Mastery, Heightened Senses, Heightened Reactions%% - Beasts: Regeneration, Enlarged Form, Corruption Resistance, Wild Empathy%% - Dragons: Elemental Resistance (by type); Energy Projection (by type); Material Creation (by type); Kinesis (by type); Enlarged Form; Flight,,
Mental - Heightened Senses I and II,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your senses are stronger than normal.%%%%I: Your senses operate at the peak of human efficiency, but more importantly, you are better than normal at understanding their input. You can listen to multiple conversations at one time, track multiple targets within your field of vision, or see in semi-darkness as well as broad daylight. This control also works in reverse - your senses will not be overwhelmed by normal levels of stimuli and even weapons specifically designed to damage or overwhelm senses (such as blinding lasers, flashbang grenades, or nauseating gasses) will be greatly reduced in effectiveness.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Bru/Sup/Bea/Dra/Exp/Ele/Dru - 50 EP%%%%II: Your senses exceed the human norms to the things regularly possible by animals. You can track by scent as well as any bloodhound, navigate in the dark using echoes, and see into the infrared and ultraviolet ends of the light spectrum.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Bru/Sup/Bea/Dra/Exp/Ele/Dru - 100 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Mental - Heightened Reactions I and II,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You are more aware of your surroundings and the dangers around you.%%%%I: You are rarely surprised and may attempt to defend against or dodge any attack you are aware of.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Bru/Sup/Bea/Dra/Ele/Dru - 50 EP%%%%II: You are never surprised and may attempt to defend against or dodge any attack, even ones you are not aware of.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Bru/Sup/Bea/Dra/Ele/Dru - 100 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Mental - Mental Prowess I to III,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Your mind is sharp and your memory strong.%%%%I: You don’t forget things, no matter how long ago you were last exposed to them and can generally think quickly and can arrive at the right answer given a bit of time. Note that this generally only works on memories you make after gaining this ability. This enhanced memory also means that your skills will not deteriorate from disuse. You are also better at compartmentalizing your memories, providing you a degree of protection against the erosion of identity that can occur when large amounts of new memories are added suddenly.%%Dsc: War/Sch/Mdr/Cra/Arc/Sup/Lch/Kng/Dra/Exp/Hea - 50 EP%%%%II: As tier I, plus your mental calculations are now lightning-fast, you have perfect recall, infinite mental storage, and can absorb knowledge simply by glancing at a page of text for a few seconds.%%Dsc: War/Sch/Mdr/Cra/Arc/Sup/Lch/Kng/Dra/Exp/Hea - 100 EP%%%%III: As tier II, plus your calculation ability is flawless and you can absorb a page of text simply by glancing at it. Your memory is so good that it manages to retroactively sharpen memories you made before gaining this ability, giving you crystal clarity on even ancient memories.%%Dsc: Sch/Mdr/Cra/Arc/Lch - 200 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Mental - Mental Resistance I to III,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Your mind and will are strong.%%%%I: You are very difficult to intimidate and have a high resistance to mental fatigue (such as from extended warfare or study) and can generally delay dealing with mental trauma until any immediate crisis is dealt with. Also, you do not get bored with tasks easily and can study or practice abilities for extended periods without penalty or need for a break.%%Dsc: all Essences - 50 EP%%%%II: Immunity to the items in tier I plus a high degree of resistance to memetic hazards, insanity, mind control, and other factors that would impact how your mind works.%%Dsc: all Essences - 100 EP%%%%III: Complete immunity to the items in tiers I and II.%%Dsc: all Essences - 200 EP,,Purchased at third tier in the Watchmen jump
Spiritual - Blank I and II,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Abilities which gather information about your past, present, or future do not work on you. This includes scrying, divination, mind reading, and even cold reading and lie detection. This ability not only affects your immediate person but also provides a degree of protection to items and people around you, making it difficult to predict the past, present, or future of any group you move with or vessel you travel on. If you have the Essential Mutuality perk, your affected companions gain the full benefit of your Blank perk even if they are acting independently.%%%%I: You are immune to all supernatural and technological abilities and devices which perform the functions described above. You simply do not register to such abilities, though your own abilities function normally. Purely mundane skills at cold reading or lie detection will be less effective, but still function to some degree.%%Dsc: Sch/Ass/Arc/Sup/Lch/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea - 100 EP%%%%II: Even mundane versions of the above items do not function against you. Furthermore, you are able to detect when someone is actively attempting to discern such information through supernatural or technological abilities or devices and feed them false information of the type they expect. Thus, you can feed an image of yourself asleep in bed to a scrying spell while you’re secretly across town beating up thugs or you can have a truth detection spell return ‘truth’ when you are telling a lie. Note that this does not protect you from compulsions to tell the truth or share information directly. Additionally, any items which you create have a measure of this protection, making it difficult to predict actions directly relying on those items and making it impossible to detect the items themselves with most supernatural abilities.%%Dsc:Sch/Ass/Arc/Sup/Lch/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea - 200 EP,,Purchased at second tier%%Purchased in the Warframe jump
Spiritual - Empathetic I and II,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Your ability to read people goes beyond basic social skills.%%%%I: If you are familiar with a person’s culture, it is easy for you to pick up on their body language and subconscious movements. This provides a great deal of information about their emotional and mental state, as well as the truthfulness of their words.%%Dsc: Sch/Vam/Kng/Hea - 50 EP%%%%II: You no longer need knowledge of a person’s culture to divine their emotional and mental state, provided you are familiar with their race or take a little time to familiarize yourself with them first. You can get a good feel for what a faceless blob from the other side of the universe is thinking with just a few minutes of discussion.%%Dsc: Sch/Vam/Kng/Hea - 100 EP,,
Spiritual - Charismatic I and II,,1,,00,,True,,True,,You are naturally more charming than most and instinctively know what would get others to do what you want.%%%%I: You possess a control over your body language and presence that makes it easy for you to get your message across. You are never misunderstood and may conceal your emotions and intent from mundane attempts to discern them.%%Dsc: War/Arc/Vam/Kng/Hea - 50 EP%%%%II: As tier I, plus you are better at tailoring your message to your audience. When someone would have a positive impression of you from your words and actions, the strength of that positive impression is increased by half. When someone would have a negative impression of you from your words or actions,the strength of that negative impression is reduced by half. Also, you can conceal your intentions and emotions from even supernatural attempts to discern them.%%Dsc: War/Vam/Kng/Hea - 100 EP,,Purchased at first tier
Spiritual - Wild Empathy I and II,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You have a natural rapport with sub-sapient creatures. This is most commonly used with naturally occuring animals, but can be used with any being that is not sufficiently developed to be targeted by the Empathetic and Charismatic abilities.%%%%I: You find it easy to read the emotional state of sub-sapient creatures that you are familiar with and can communicate your intentions to them fairly well. This is not as robust as a spoken language, but any concept that can be conveyed in one or two words can be communicated.%%Dsc: Sha/Bea/Hea/Dru - 50 EP%%%%II: As tier II, plus you may become familiar enough with a creature to communicate with it in only a few seconds of observation or interaction. Your interactions may also be slightly more complex, extending to concepts that require as many as three words. Your target’s ability to comprehend and act on your communication will still be limited by its nature.%%Dsc: Sha/Bea/Hea/Dru - 50 EP,,
Spiritual - Unflappable,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,You have a knack for keeping your appearance the way you want it, even in the middle of the wilderness. It takes a lot for you to get dirty, and even then, it tends to just accentuate your look instead of detract from it.%%Dsc: Kng - 50 EP,,
Spiritual - Corruption Resistance,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,This perk confers protection against supernatural influences that target your soul or that fall outside the bounds of physical or mental influence. Unless you specifically wish for it to do so, no contract, curse, possession, or effect can take hold of, bind, or damage your soul or being. When you first gain this perk, your soul is restored to an uncorrupted, whole state and any supernatural influences are cast off.%%Dsc: Sch/Cra/Arc/Sha/Kng/Bea/Exp/Hea/Dru - 100 EP,,Purchased in the Control Jump
Spiritual - Inertia of Self I and II,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are protected against effects that would affect your mind and existence.%%%%I: You are immune to any effect that would affect your memories. If someone turns back time, alters reality, or attempts to directly alter your memories, you retain both the ‘original’ and ‘new’ memories, instinctively knowing which set is which. Other than your two sets of memories, this perk does nothing to tell you who changed things or even what they specifically changed if it isn’t otherwise obvious.%%Dsc: Sch/Mdr/Cra/Ass/Arc/Vam/Sha/Kng/Bea/Exp - 100 EP%%%%II: You are immune to any effect that would alter or outright destroy your body or existence. This protection extends to conceptual, temporal, and reality warping effects that work either directly or indirectly to destroy or alter you. This would prevent a time traveler from killing you as a baby or causing an accident that would leave present-you paralyzed. It would not protect you from a fireball created through temporal manipulation or having a time traveler frame you for a crime that lands you in prison.%%Dsc: Sch/Mdr/Cra/Ass/Arc/Vam/Sha/Kng/Bea/Exp - 200 EP,,Purchased at second tier in the Death March to the Parrallel World Rhapsody Jump
Spiritual - Supernatural Resource Recovery I to IV,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are better at regenerating the energy needed to power your supernatural abilities, whether this is mana, ki, or something more exotic.%%%%I: You do not suffer penalties to your recovery rate for any reason and always recover energy as though in the best possible situation, such as resting quietly or near a magical nexus, even if you aren’t. If you have a power source that does not normally regenerate (such as a blood pool or the energy of captured souls), it now regenerates at a slow rate (enough to power a powerful ability once per month).%%Dsc: Mdr/Arc - 50 EP%%%%II: As tier I, but your recovery rate is now doubled. If your power source does not naturally regenerate, you now regain enough to power a powerful ability once every two weeks.%%Dsc: Mdr/Arc - 100 EP%%%%III: As tier II, but your recovery rate is now quadrupled. If your power source does not naturally regenerate, you now regain enough to power a powerful ability once per week.%%Dsc: Mdr/Arc - 200 EP%%%%IV: As tier III, but your recovery rate is now increased by a factor of ten. If your power source does not naturally regenerate, you now regain enough to power a powerful ability once per day.%%Dsc: Mdr/Arc - 400 EP,,Purchased at the third tier in the Arcanum - Of Steamworks and Magic Obscura jump, and at fourth tier in the Witcher jump
Skill,,1,,00,,False,,False,,Standard skill perks give a learning speed boost by tier of x2/x10/x100/x1000 and give immediate initial knowledge levels in skills you have been exposed to that fit the category by tier of Familiar/Competent/Expert/Master. So tier II gives x10 learning speed and Competent skill level.%%%%See the Notes section for more details on how this works.%%%%Costs 50 / 100 / 200 / 400 EP for each respective stage,,

Supernatural - Power Combination I to III,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You have learned the tricks necessary to use more than one ability at one time, often increasing the effects through synergistic effects. Supernatural abilities can be combined on-the-fly with this ability, but doing so tends to be inefficient. Commonly used combinations are better if researched and refined using Supernatural Engineer or a similar ability, though such an effort obviously takes considerable time and effort.%%%%I: Inherently conflicting abilities now work together without a chance for backlash. You can use the light side of the force with the dark side. You can channel electricity from one hand and blast water from the other without electrocuting yourself. You can combine two perks or powers, and the cost of using the powers is increased slightly. Abilities which cost no energy may be combined freely.%%Dsc: War/Sch/Ass/Arc/Sup/Bea/Kng/Hea/Ele - 200 EP%%%%II: As tier I, but your ability extends to up to three abilities at one time and you may combine alternate forms as well as perks and powers. Doing so typically costs about twice as much in terms of energy as using the individual abilities separately. Abilities which cost no energy may be combined freely.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Arc/Sup/Kng/Bea/Hea/Ele - 400 EP%%%%III: As tier II, but you are no longer limited in the number of abilities you can combine at one time and you may combine any abilities which can reasonably be combined. Items and companions typically can’t be combined, but just about anything else can be. The energy cost of combining powers increases sharply as more are added, and after ten abilities, the cost is likely to exceed any reasonable resource pool. Abilities which cost no energy may be combined freely and are not considered in the rate of cost increase.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Arc/Sup/Kng/Bea/Hea/Ele - 600 EP,,Purchased at third tier%%Purchased at first tier in the Diablo jump, at second tier in the Inheritance Cycle jump and at third tier in the Skulduggery Pleasant jump
Supernatural - Private Reality,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have access to an extradimensional space which contains a section of land approximately a square kilometer in area.%%%%By default, this takes the form of rich, temperate farmland with a small cottage surrounded by dense woodland. At your discretion, the land may instead be a tropical island, desert oasis, or another mundane environment.%%%%Entering the forest causes one to wander briefly before finding themselves once more at the edge of the property. At your discretion, the border may instead be endless ocean, trackless desert, thick mists, or even simply a wall of shadows.%%%%Once it has been set, you may change the configuration of the Private Reality, though it takes approximately the duration of a jump to complete the transition.%%%%If you have a Warehouse or similar space, you may connect it to this reality through a door, cave, or other opening.%%%%If you do not have a Warehouse, you may instead access this reality through any mundane doorway, opening, or archway with a few short words of power.%%%%When you obtain further properties, those properties may join the Private Reality, which will expand to accommodate them.%%%%You control how properties integrate. This integration could be as simple as adding the new property along the borders of the old or as complex as fully hybridizing with the existing properties within the Private Reality, keeping the characteristics of each that you desire. For instance, if you own a magical school and a cyberpunk-tech city, you could create a school that taught both magic and cyber technology, populate the city with cybernetic wizards, or any other combination you can imagine.%%%%Changes and improvements to the properties within the Private Reality persist between jumps.%%%%You may choose to have the Private Reality insert itself somewhere in the reality of your current jump. This decision must be made before the jump starts and the way the Reality inserts itself will make sense in the context of the jump. A Reality the size of a country might transform into a rival high school, a corporation, a small country, a continent, a neighboring planet, or even a stellar empire, depending on the setting of the Jump. If you choose this option, you may not access the Reality through the Warehouse or other openings.%%%%Dsc: Cra/Kng,,
Supernatural - Cheat Death I and II,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You have a technique that allows you to cheat death (and thus avoid a chain failure). This ability can only function once per jump or if ten years have passed since it was last used (whichever is sooner). You should choose the form that this ability takes when you first take it, but you may revise the conditions between jumps.%%%%I: Your ability to cheat death is restricted in some way and leaves you vulnerable in some way. Examples include a vampire that turns to mist and returns to its coffin where it is paralyzed until the next sunset, a lich that reforms near its phylactery and is helpless for several hours, or a respawn effect that puts you only a few feet from where you just died. In general, the farther from immediate danger this ability takes you, the longer you will be incapacitated. You may only resurrect in an area which could reasonably be accessed by a determined enemy, so choosing to have your respawn point inside your Warehouse is likely to severely undermine your security.%%Dsc: War/Ass/Lch/Vam/Sha/Exp/Hea - 400 EP%%%%II: As tier I, but your vulnerability period is significantly less. Hours become minutes and if you choose to reappear where you were killed, you are completely invulnerable to harm for approximately one minute. All warnings about not respawning inside your Warehouse remain in effect.%%Dsc: Ass/Lch/Vam/Sha/Exp/Hea - 600 EP,,
Supernatural - Reflexive Reinforcement I and II,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Your durability is more than just your physical body. For someone to defeat you, they must deplete both your physical and metaphysical reserves.%%%%I: You may take damage to your energy reserves instead of to your physical body, though it remains proportional. For instance, if an attack would remove 5% of your physical integrity, it will remove 5% of your mana pool. If you have more than one type of energy, all such pools are affected equally. A fatal blow will usually completely drain your energy reserves and leave you wounded, but alive. Once this ability averts a fatal blow, it cannot be used again until your energy reserves have completely refilled at least once or a minute has passed, whichever takes longer.%%Dsc: War/Arc/Bru/Lch/Ele - 400 EP%%%%II: As tier I, but your loss of spiritual energy is no longer strictly proportional and will always be sufficient to stop a single source of damage. An otherwise fatal blow thus leaves you physically unharmed but completely drains your energy reserves. Once this ability averts a fatal blow, it cannot be used again until your energy reserves have completely refilled at least once or a minute has passed, whichever takes longer.%%Dsc: War/Arc/Bru/Lch/Ele - 600 EP,,
Supernatural - Master of Many Arts I to III,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are adept at learning sometimes conflicting supernatural abilities.%%%%I: When a perk, power, or style requires you to focus on a specific aspect of something, any penalties for using non-focused aspects are reduced. For instance, if you have a Force Sensitive perk and choose an affinity to the Light side, any penalties for also using the Dark Side are reduced (if they were impossible, they now become difficult; if they were difficult, they are now less difficult, etc).%%Dsc: Sch/Arc/Bru/Kng - 100 EP%%%%II: As tier I, plus penalties are removed entirely and you are shielded from the inherent issues with simultaneously using two opposing elements. At its most basic level, this perk allows you to ignore inherent restrictions, but with effort can lead you to actually combining normally conflicting arts into something greater than the parts. Unlike Power Combinations, this does not inherently increase the cost of the individual abilities.%%Dsc: Sch/Arc/Bru/Kng - 200 EP%%%%III: As tier II, plus if a perk gives you access to a style of magic, energy system, or similar set of abilities but also prohibits the purchasing of other perks or multiple versions of itself, you may ignore that restriction. For instance, if a Star Wars jump had a Force User: Light Side and a Force User: Dark Side perk and each prevented buying the other, you could purchase both.%%Dsc: Sch/Arc/Bru/Kng - 400 EP,,Purchased at second tier in the Ryuuou no Oshigoto jump, and at third tier in the Bloons TD5 jump
Supernatural - Defense Piercing Techniques I and II,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You understand your powers on a fundamental level and can use that understanding to pierce defenses.%%%%In this case, a ‘defense’ includes things like armor, defensive spells, or innate resistance to damage. It does not include things like sheer size, natural toughness, or the like. While this may overcome immortality methods that rely on invulnerability, it is ineffective against immortality methods that rely on other methods of protection.%%%%I: Any defenses below the level of Drawbacks and Jump Fiat that would normally apply against your supernatural abilities, such as the fire resistance of a fire elemental, are no longer completely effective, allowing approximately 20% of the attack through. This also works against general magic immunity.%%Dsc: Sch/Arc/Dra/Ele - 400 EP%%%%II: As tier II, but now half of your attack penetrates any defenses below the level of Drawbacks and Jump Fiat.%%Dsc: Sch/Arc/Dra/Ele - 600 EP,,
Supernatural - Trivial Applications,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Once you have an ability to do things on a large scale, you can produce trivial versions of that effect on a small scale at-will and for no energy cost. Mastering fire magic would let you light a fire with a fingertip. Mastering force magic would let you generate an Unseen Servant effect. The power level of these lesser effects is generally on the order of cantrips and 1st level spells from Dungeons and Dragons or a similar system.%%%%Dsc: Sch/Mdr/Arc/Lch/Kng/Ele/Dru,,
Supernatural - Over-Caster,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You have learned to get more effect out of your spells through the brute-force method of spending more time or energy on them. The longer you spend building up a spell and the more energy you dump into it, the greater its effect will be. This isn’t a pure 1:1 ratio and the gain will eventually taper off, though the more powerful the base effect, the higher it can be boosted.%%%%Dsc: Sch/Arc/Dru,,
Supernatural - Healing Touch I to IV,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You can improve the recovery of others using your internal energy. Initially, this ability can affect only one target, but with practice and time, its effects can be applied to any number of patients at once. You do not have to remain in physical contact with the patients, but must remain within approximately 10 meters. This distance can be slightly increased with practice, as well. You may target yourself with this ability provided you are conscious and able to use abilities that draw on your internal energy reserves.%%%%I: Patients under your care recover ten times as quickly as they normally would. They are never at risk of infection or other complications to the healing process and may ignore any penalties to their recovery for poor nutrition, poor conditions, or similar issues. This does not noticeably deplete your energy reserves.%%Dsc: Sch/Hea/Dru - 100 EP%%%%I: Patients under your care recover ten times as quickly as they normally would. They are never at risk of infection or other complications to the healing process and may ignore any penalties to their recovery for poor nutrition, poor conditions, or similar issues. This does not noticeably deplete your energy reserves. Dsc: Sch/Hea/Dru%%%%II: As tier I, but the rate of healing is faster. Patients under your care recover twenty times as quickly as they normally would. Additionally, you can focus a significant amount of your energy into a single patient to cause them to heal much faster. By doing so, you can cause minor wounds to close in minutes or major wounds to close in hours. All mundane diseases and disorders will also fade within a matter of hours. Furthermore, while you are actively healing a patient in this manner, they will not die, no matter how dire their condition may be.%%Dsc: Sch/Hea - 200 EP%%%%III: As tier II, but your rate of passive healing increases to fifty times normal and you may force a single patient to heal even faster. By spending a significant amount of energy, you can cause a patient’s minor wounds to close in seconds and major wounds to close in minutes. Even magical diseases will be wiped away over the course of an hour. Furthermore, you can restore crippled or even severed body parts by focusing your energy over the course of a few hours.%%Dsc: Hea - 400 EP%%%%IV: As tier III, but your powers are even stronger in two ways.%% - You may bring back the recently dead as long as their brain (or brain equivalent) has not started to decay. This requires an intact (or mostly intact) brain and treatment must be started within about three minutes of clinical death (for a human). This takes approximately as long as healing with tier III of this power (at the top end, growing a new body for a severed head takes a few hours). %% - Constant exposure to your power strengthens others. Using small treatments that individually take a few minutes at a time, you may grant anyone the Physical Prowess I, Physical Resistance I, and Ageless I perks after about a month of daily treatments (Note that Ageless I applied this way only doubles extends remaining lifespan, but it does restore the target to peak performance). Companions may only benefit from this ability if they are not also benefiting from a companion perk that ties their EP to yours.%%Dsc: Hea - 600 EP,,
Supernatural - Energy Drain I to V,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Choose a type of energy or a substance. This can be a mundane energy such as fire or electricity, a substance such as blood, or an abstract energy like magic, life force, or souls. You may use this energy/substance to restore your own energy, or you may simply capture and hold the energy with this ability for use by other powers (such as capturing souls for a soul-based attack later). What is considered a “unit” of substance will vary with the relative rarity of that substance. Common examples include a bonfire of flame, two pints of fresh blood, a quarter of a soul, half of the life force of an average human, or the magic needed to power your highest level spell. Living targets can resist this drain in many ways, but most non-living targets require Supernatural abilities of some sort to do so. This ability may be taken multiple times, choosing a different thing to drain each time.%%%%At the most basic level: This ability functions at a range of touch and drains one unit to restore 25% of your energy reserves over the course of ten seconds; the use of this ability is obvious to observers.%%%%For each tier of this ability, choose one bonus from the following list (note that some bonuses cost more than one pick):%% - Range: Increase the range of the attack to 10m/100m/1km/10km/ unlimited; No matter the range, line-of-sight is still required.%% - Efficiency (limit 3): Each unit restores 50%/75%/100% of your energy%% - Volume (limit 2): Each use drains up to 2/4 units from each target; Note that the target has to have enough units to drain%% - Speed (limit 2): Each draining attempt now takes only 5/2 seconds.%% - Targets: Each use now affects 2/4/6/8/10 targets.%% - Burst (costs 3): On activation, all targets in 10m are hit with the drain effect. Cannot be combined with Range.%% - Aura (costs 4): Once activated, the drain occurs every 10 seconds on all targets in range. This period can be reduced by Speed.%% - Invisible (limit 2): Either the ability itself is invisible (though you still have to touch or gesture at the target) or there is no visible effect on the target (though a living target will certainly know something is wrong). If taken twice, both effects are invisible.%%%%Dsc: Vam/Hea,,
Supernatural - Minion Creation I to III,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You can create minions of a general type such as vampire spawn, undead, elemental servants, or animals. Minions tend to be no stronger than a regular human, fairly dumb, and short-lived or, at least, their loyalty is. Minions created from thin air vanish within an hour or two, while those created from appropriate reagents may last days or weeks depending on the quality of the reagents. Undead created from the living beings or corpses of formerly living beings remain undead until destroyed. This ability can be re-applied before the last application fades to extend its benefits. Initially, a minion creator may only command the loyalty of two minions at a time, but with practice and effort, this amount can be increased. At your discretion, you may choose to ‘re-summon’ the same creature when using this ability and allow it to have continuous memories with the last time it was ‘summoned’.%%%%I: Creating minions is generally a slow process, taking about an hour.%%Dsc: Mdr/Lch/Vam/Kng/Ele - 200 EP%%%%II: Creating minions is faster, taking only minutes.%%Dsc: Mdr/Lch/Vam/Kng/Ele - 400 EP%%%%III: Creating minions is even faster, taking only a moment per minion.%%Dsc: Mdr/Lch/Vam/Kng/Ele - 600 EP,,
Supernatural - Minion Empowerment I to IV,,1,,00,,False,,True,,If you have minions, such as those created with the Minion Creation ability, loyal troops, devoted worshipers, or companions, you may give them a temporary boost in strength. For each tier of this ability, choose one of the effects below (you may choose the second effect multiple times). Using this ability takes only a touch and a moment. This effect lasts approximately one day. A minion may benefit from only one use of this ability at a time, though a second use may refresh the one day duration or completely override the first use.%%%%One minion without an Essence gains an Essence from this document (and all the free perks that entails if they do not already have them).%%%%One minion which has an Essence gains 200 EP to spend on perks, discounted by their own Essence as appropriate. These perks do not stack with existing Essential Body Modification Supplement v1.11 Page 32 perks and minions receive no additional discounts if they already have a perk at a lower tier. For instance, a minion with Physical Prowess I still requires 200 EP worth of their Empowered budget to take Physical Prowess III (assuming no discount from Essence). Perks may be selected from the Physical, Mental, Spiritual, and Skill categories. Supernatural Perks may be purchased from the following list:%% - Higher tier versions of base form perks (such as Physical Prowess IV).%% - Form perks such as Form Mastery or Enlarged Form.%% - Flight, Space Flight, Energy Projection, Matter Creation, Kinesis, or Defense Piercing Techniques.%%%%Dsc: War/Mdr/Cra/Lch/Vam/Kng/Hea/Ele - 100 / 200 / 400 / 600 EP,,
Supernatural - Divinity,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Requires at least one Essence and 1000 in accumulated EP%%%%Your Essence has become a tiny spark of divinity. Dsc: None%%%%You may choose a divine portfolio related to one of your Essences. You gain a very small but noticeable boost to actions and skills related to that portfolio. A war god would be a slightly better fighter while a god of invention would find scientific pursuits slightly easier, for example.%%%%You may draw a trickle of energy from the worship of others. The amount of energy gained even from legions of devout worshipers is very small, but provides you a metaphysical link to your worshipers. While this does not provide a detailed channel of communication, you receive vague impressions of what your followers desire when enough of them share the same desire. You find the effects of your portfolio increased significantly while acting to address the needs of your worshipers.%%%%You may have any abilities you possess that explicitly draw power from a divine source draw power from your own divine nature. This does not automatically improve any success chances or results, but does generally remove the need to appease another divine entity in order to use your abilities.%%%%After your chain has concluded, even if you fail to gain the typical rewards for a successful end jump, you may choose to ascend to true godhood. Doing so binds you to that universe (or local multiverse) but greatly increases your divine abilities and your ability to draw energy from worship.%%%%You may determine where the souls of your followers go upon their death. If you have an appropriate reality (such as the one provided by the Private Reality perk in this document), you may set that up as an afterlife or you may negotiate with the owners of local afterlife planes for permission to have your followers retire there upon death. If you lack access to an appropriate afterlife, you may store the souls within yourself until you do.,,

Devices that provide other functions, such as implanted radios and radar units only function if the prevalent technology or magic level of the Gauntlet would include those things.,,
Item - Essential Annexation I to IV,,1,,00,,False,,True,,After choosing this perk, you may choose a piece of property in a later jump to bring with you after you leave that jump. You must ‘own’ this property by local laws in order to claim it for this perk. This property will connect to your cosmic warehouse or equivalent reality after it leaves the jump. While it cannot inherently insert itself into future realities, it can be subject to any Import options or the import options of the Private Reality perk in this supplement. The size of the property is limited by the level of this perk. This perk may be bought multiple times, but each perk can only be used on a single property (and the targeted property may not be changed later).%%%%I (Personal): The property can be a single building or stretch of land, with the limits varying a little bit with how much ‘stuff’ is included. A Megablock from DREDD would qualify as the top end for developed land while an 80 acre farm with few structures would qualify as the top end for raw land. - 100 EP%%%%II (City-Sized): The property can now be any expanse of land and structures that would fill 1000 km2 or less (about 386 mi 2 ). - 200 EP%%%%III (Planetary): The property can now be the size of a planet. - 400 EP%%%%IV (System): The property can now be as large as an entire star system, including all planets, stars, and other items. - 600 EP,,

Companion - Essence Transfer,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Choose one or more of your companions that are not benefitting from any sort of Body Mod supplement other than this one.

Companion - Essence Network I and II,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You have learned to apply Essence Link to many companions at one time. When you purchase this perk, you may ‘refund’ any number of Essence Link perks and apply those EP to this one. You may purchase this perk more than once. Each purchase allows for the benefits to extend to 8 active companions.

Companion - Essential Mutuality,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your Essence sharing with your companions is more potent than normal. Any companions targeted by Essence Link or Essence Network also gain some protection from your non-physical defensive perks. This protection is approximately half of what the full perk offers. Blank and Personal Immunity offer their full benefit to affected companions, as noted in their descriptions.,,
Companion - Essence Investment,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Between jumps, you may invest any of your perks into your companions. When you do so, you lose access to the perk for the duration of the jump and your companion may use it as though they had purchased it normally. If a perk has prerequisites, your companion must still meet those either on their own or through the investment of other perks.

Once all eligible perks have been purchased, this CP gain ends and any unused CP disappear.%%%%Treat the cost of all perks as the amount that you paid for them, to a minimum of 100 CP per perk. This means that a 600 CP perk that was discounted to 300 CP costs the child 300 CP, but it also means that a free perk costs them 100 CP.%%%%When this perk no longer affects the child, they retain all purchased perks, normally.%%%%The child to be targeted by this ability must currently benefit from Essence Link or Essence Network.

Companion - Essential Companion I to IV,,1,,00,,False,,False,,For each tier of this perk, choose one of your companions. Those companions gain the following benefits:%%%%If a jump does not include a companion import option, this companion may still be imported. Doing so costs no points, and they gain the same background as the Jumper along with any free perks granted to everyone or to that background. They gain no further CP for that jump.%%%%During Gauntlets, the companion is forced to conform to local standards of technology, magic, and similar and cannot have capabilities that exceed the highest levels of the Physical, Mental, and Spiritual perks shown in this document. The companion will also adapt to the local setting in the most logical manner possible. A dragon companion might import into a modern-day earth setting as a pet iguana, for instance. Most humanoid companions will simply become the default race for the setting. This does not automatically provide the companion with an alternate form that can be used later.%%%%Any Gauntlet protections and restrictions that apply to the Jumper also apply to the companion. These protections do trump Drawbacks (especially chain drawbacks that penalize dead companions in some way).%%%%You may only purchase this perk once, but you may change the companion(s) it affects between jumps.%%%%100 / 200 / 400 / 600 EP,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,These drawbacks apply to all jumps which don’t directly contradict them. Because they are chain-long drawbacks, if a drawback is reliably circumvented, the points should be “paid back” or a new drawback of equivalent points should be selected. You may also use UDS drawbacks with some limitations (see Notes section for details).,,
Drawbacks - Dependency,,4,,1000,,False,,True,,You require a specific substance for your comfortable survival. Failing to do so on a regular basis results in considerable discomfort and the symptoms typically associated with withdrawal. The time interval between consumption should vary according to the relative rarity of the substance. Something generally trivial to obtain, such as alcohol, needs to be consumed weekly. Something very exotic, such as the soul of an infant born under a blood red moon, needs to be consumed once per jump.%%%%If you need to consume sustenance in some form, this dependency can instead be a considerable narrowing of the categories of sustenance you can consume or greatly increasing the amount of normal sustenance. For instance, a vampire may need to consume only the blood of virgins or a human might need to eat huge meals three times a day.%%%%This drawback is strangely friendly and will adapt and change with your current abilities and environment, making you need a substance that you can obtain in reasonable amounts. For instance, if you find yourself in a world with no alcohol and your Dependency normally requires alcohol, you might crave something entirely different for the jump and then go back to needing alcohol on the next jump.,,
Drawbacks - Standout,,4,,00,,False,,True,,You stand out to sentient beings.%%%%Noticed - You simply stand out. Others take notice of you no matter where you go, though their interest is usually benign. This drawback makes it difficult to move unnoticed through crowds. - 100 EP%%%%Unnerving - Your presence generates a vague unease in those that notice you. It is difficult to move through crowds and you are always remembered in a negative way. This drawback means that if something goes wrong, the local authorities are usually on the lookout for someone matching your description shortly thereafter and you will have a hard time talking your way into places.%%%%Provocative - Your presence does more than simply unnerve viewers, but causes a visceral reaction. What form this reaction tends to take is up to you, though the “4 Fs” are usually a good place to start. Fight, flight, food, or mating.,,
Drawbacks - Unnatural Presence,,4,,1000,,True,,True,,You exude a subtle, unnatural vibe that goes unnoticed by most sentient creatures, but disturbs beasts and other natural beings. Dogs bark and growl, deer flee, and crows flock to your presence.,,
Drawbacks - Elemental Vulnerability,,4,,500,,False,,True,,Choose an element. You are more vulnerable to that element than other beings, making it approximately twice as difficult for you to defend against and all injuries from that element are twice as great as they otherwise would be. You may not reduce these injuries through any means, though armor and other means of prevention will work normally. You may choose this Drawback more than once, choosing a different element each time.,,
Drawbacks - Vulnerability,,4,,00,,False,,True,,You are weakened in some situations.%%%%I: You have a specific vulnerability to a substance that either ignores your defenses or causes you damage or irritation. The more common the substance, the less pronounced the effect. This substance can be very specific, but taking this drawback will ensure that your enemies can either obtain or create an equivalent given enough time and effort. An example might be Superman’s vulnerability to Kryptonite (and synthetic equivalents) or an undead that is uncomfortable in sunlight. - 100 EP%%%%II: As I, but the effects are more pronounced for a given rarity of substance. Examples include a vampire that has its flesh melt in sunlight or a werewolf that suffers damage from simply touching silver. Exotic materials would be fatal within seconds. - 200 EP,,
Drawbacks - Achilles Heel,,4,,1000,,False,,True,,You have a vulnerable spot that no amount of power or planning can completely protect. This might be a literal vulnerability on your body or it might be an item you carry that holds your soul. If it is an item, the item appears at hand at the start of every jump. No matter what precautions you take, a dedicated enemy has at least a small chance of being able to access the item or determine the vulnerable spot.,,
Drawbacks - Lovable Goof,,4,,1000,,False,,True,,You just don’t get “the social skills”. You may not buy perks which increase your charisma, empathy, or similar abilities. On the other hand, at your discretion, your social interactions may come off as awkwardly adorable or piteously pathetic, which will reduce the social consequences of your bumbling ways.%%%%Note that this only applies to social interactions. You may still lead a military unit, manage a business, or negotiate for a used car without penalty.,,
Drawbacks - Dread,,4,,1000,,False,,True,,Choose three conditions that you are supernaturally compelled to react to in certain ways. These conditions include things like being repelled by objects of faith, not being able to lie to a holy man, not being able to enter a home uninvited, or similar items that are quirky and annoying, but not automatically life-threatening.,,
Drawbacks - Compelled,,4,,1000,,False,,True,,Choose three activities that you are supernaturally compelled to engage in. As with Dread, these items should be annoying and quirky, but not automatically life-threatening. Examples include only being able to use aliases that are anagrams of your real name, compulsively hoarding gold or maidens, or being unable to refuse request for aid made in good faith.,,
Drawbacks - Softhearted,,4,,1000,,False,,True,,You are a sucker for a sob story. Not only do you have a hard time passing up genuine pleas for help, but you find yourself unable to leave any such charity work half-done. You not only have to help save the orphanage, but have to find homes for the orphans that touched your heart while doing so.,,
Drawbacks - Unstackable I and II,,4,,00,,False,,True,,Your Body Mod abilities (those from the Basic, Physical, Mental, Spiritual, and Skill categories) do not stack with some of your other abilities. Abilities which do not overlap still function normally. See the Notes section for details on how this normally works.%%%%I: Your Body Mod abilities only stack with the base capabilities of your alternate forms. - 50 EP%%%%II: Your Body Mod abilities don’t stack at all. - 100 EP,,
Drawbacks - Wardrobe Malfunction I and II,,4,,00,,False,,True,,You have a bad habit of ending up exposed when you utilize any form of shapeshifting. If you grow larger, your clothing tends to split and burst off your body. If you grow smaller, your clothing tends to fall off your body. If your clothing should automatically resize, the mechanisms that make that happen tend to lag a second or two behind your shapeshifting, giving you a few moments of embarrassment. Effects that cause your clothing to merge with your body also have a bit of a lag. Expect to end up naked for a second or two every time you shift.%%%%I: The above is just inconvenient. Expect a little embarrassment or needing to find a secluded place to shapeshift. - 50 CP%%%%II: The above is beyond inconvenient and becomes outright destructive. Clothing you wear when you shift tends to get ripped and damaged, no matter how resilient it should be. - 100 CP,,
