Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Roll 1d8 for location or pay 50cp to change freely.%%%%1. Seryuu City (The starting city of Satou’s journey, home of the Devil’s Labyrinth.)%%%%2. Labyrinth City Selbira (The most well-known labyrinth in Shiga Kingdom. Say hello to Ban, will you?)%%%%3. Saga Empire (The home of most summoned heroes.)%%%%4. Shiga Kingdom Royal Capital (The great center of a powerful hero’s legacy.)%%%%5. Boruenan Forest (The home of most elves and the World Tree.)%%%%6. Weasel Empire (Shunned by most nations for ‘taboo’ practices, it is the closest in technology and values to the modern world due to numerous reincarnated residents.)%%%%7. Dragon’s Valley (I hope you’re prepared for a major beating.)%%%%8. Free Choice (You can choose anywhere where normal people reside in.),,
Dreamer,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This is the drop-in origin. You awoke in this world after going to sleep (probably while working on your computer game). You have no extra memories holding you down, but at the same time you will have to make your way in this world without any helpful knowledge.,,
Reincarnator,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You died, and you were given another chance by a powerful being that calls themself “God”. You are normally supposed to be reborn as a baby or toddler, but you can start your entrance to this world as a teenager or young adult, depending on the age you roll.,,
Summoned Hero,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Congratulations! You were summoned by the great god Parion to become a regular isekai hero! Not only do you become a widely recognized figure in this world, you will receive the support of various countries in order to defeat a demon lord. You can override your location to that of Saga Empire, the typical summoning place for heroes.,,
Local,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are one of the inhabitants of this world. While life in this world can vary from a literal demonic hellhole to a season of pastoral boredom, you are still more knowledgeable about this world than these people from foreign dimensions.,,
Notes,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Every human and demi-human in this world gets a random number of skill points between 2 and 12 when they level up. All the factors that go into this are not clear, but Humans tend to average lower than 6 and Demihumans tend to average higher than 7 per level, while Demons and Dragons just kind of ignore this and have as many skill points as they need to be ridiculous.%%%%Most creatures do not get to decide where their skill points go, they are automatically assigned for them based on the activities they perform.%%%%You, jumper, will get a set number of skill points each level based on your race and other perk choices and may assign them however you like based on the types of activities performed before level up. (Ie. If you were studying fire magic you can put all your points into fire magic or some into fire magic, some into reading, and some into the language the book was written in.)%%%%%%As a general guideline, a level 1 Human with a 1 in all stats is basically comparable to a newborn baby, while a level 50 human with a 50 in all stats would be comparable to MCU Steve Rogers - Captain America, a supposedly peak human (really he is a good bit better) in every way, able to lift about 5 tons run 60 mph across difficult terrain while doing advanced calculus and differential equations in your head. A level 99 Human with 99 in all stats would be more comparable with a really fast slightly smarter Peter Parker - Spiderman (who is one of the smartest people in the world by comic book standards), able to lift about 50 tons run between 120 mph and 600 mph depending on the terrain jump about 600 feet and cure cancer while quickly grabbing a hotdog. A level 140 Demon [Demon Lord] with some stat boosting spells and skills is on par with a weakened grand servants and might be able to swings swords so hard he can leave craters like the Grand Canyon behind, move at relativistic speed (actual relativistic speed like dodging lightning for fun), or magically wiping continents with a few spells.%%%%%%The relationship between levels and abilities seems to represent an upwards curve along the lines of if you double your level and specific stat, the actual increase in application of that stat is increased by an order of magnitude. (Level 12 Strength 12) = 100lbs or .05 tons, (Level 25 Strength 25) = lift 1,000 lbs or .5 tons, (Level 50 Strength 50) = Lift 10,000 lbs or 5 tons, (Level 100 Strength 100) = Lift 100,000 lbs or 50 tons. The experience required to level up before the soft cap at level 50 is 50% more per level than the total required experience to get to the last level, after the soft cap the levels become even harder to earn. ( So if it takes 10xp to get to level 2, it will take you 15xp (25 total xp) to get to level 3, 37.5xp (62.5 total xp) to get to level 4, 93.75xp (156.25 total xp) to get to level 5... This is an extremely brutal xp curve and explains why most people have lower levels)%%%%%%,,
Human,,0,,1000,,False,,False,,You are a pretty normal average human in this world. You start at level 1 and start with a 5 in every stat (which you may rearrange at the start of the jump, i.e. give one stat a minus one to put a +1 into another) You receive 5 skill points each level and gain one stat point per level. Your HP, SP, and MP increases by 5 per level and for each stat point put into the appropriate stat.,,
Demihuman,,0,,-500,,False,,True,,You are a Demihuman. Choose an existing fantasy race such as elves or animal people. These races have minor benefits over normal humans, like heightened mana for elves or better smell and hearing for dog people. You can also take this race for free if you give it a minor flaw that balances out their ability, like heightened mana but less physical strength for elves or the option of sensory overload for dogpeople.%%%%You start at level 1 with a 5 in every stat (which you may rearrange at the start of the jump, i.e. give one stat a minus one to put a +1 into another) with an additional 5 to spend as you want. You receive 10 skill points and 1 stat point each level and a bonus stat point every other level.%%%%You get one free purchase of Unfair Advantage without having to take Disadvantage and one free purchase of I'm Quite Skilled You Know. Your HP, SP, and MP increases by 10 per level and for each stat point put into the appropriate stat.,,
Demon,,0,,-3000,,False,,True,,You are a Demon, quite a powerful race (by this world's standards), so you start at a higher level then normal, with some more or less unique abilities. You could also be a higher nature spirit such as a dryad or even an angel (just a good aligned demon), as such you may choose between [Demon] or [Divine] skills or even a neutral counterpart to represent fae if you wanted.%%%%Choose a general theme like manipulation or sword fighting and you will get some appropriate skills for the general theme, such as the manipulator gaining a charm ability and some illusion magic or the sword fighter getting a unique fighting stance and some experience with the sword. Where a dragon is all around awesome, you are more focused on your physical or magical aspects.%%%%You can even have a natural environmental advantage such as wings and flight or underwater swimming and breather, or deep poison forests.%%%%You start at level 1 with a 10 in every stat (which you may rearrange at the start of the jump, i.e.give one stat a minus two to put a +2 into another). You gain 15 skill points per level and 2 stat points each level. You get the perk Don't Stop Me Now for free plus one free purchase of Unfair Advantage, Have You Seen This Before?, and Special Snowflake* without having to take Disadvantage. Your HP, SP, and MP increases by 15 per level and for each stat point put into the appropriate stat.,,
Dragon,,0,,-5000,,False,,True,,You are a full true dragon, a lord of the natural world, every natural environment is fair game to you, but you have a particular inclination to one specific terrain based on your subspecies and always possess the ability to fly as the sky is your true calling and realm. Your body is immensely strong and you aren't a slouch at magic either. Your body is a treasury of magical, natural, and alchemical resources. You can use [Dragon] [skills] naturally.%%%%You start at level 1 with a 10 in every stat (which you may rearrange at the start of the jump, i.e. give one stat a minus two to put a +2 into another) with an additional 10 to spend as you want. You gain 15 skill points per level and 2 stat points each level with a bonus stat point every other level.%%%%You get the perk Don't Stop Me Now for free plus three free purchases of Unfair Advantage and Have You Seen This Before? without having to take Disadvantage.%%%%Your HP, SP, and MP increases by 20 per level and for each stat point put into the appropriate stat.,,
Half and Half,,0,,-1000,,False,,True,,You are a hybrid, maybe a half demon or a half dragon, maybe you were born this way or maybe through a ritual or a failed reincarnation you were transformed. Either way, you may purchase two other races through this option and get all the advantages of both races while minimizing the flaws. You will gain two titles one for each race purchased, if you purchase demon you will get the [Half Demon] title, if you purchase elf you will get the [Half Elf] title and so on. Humans cost 0cp and do not provide their +100 cp boon, Demihuman can be purchased twice for two different types of demihuman.,,
Sparkly Main Cast,,1,,00,,False,,True,,It wouldn't be an Isekai if the main cast wasn't a group of the most beautiful people around. This perk gives you a nearly perfect look in a style you want, be it rippling muscles or dangerous curves or even just a little girl. You also don’t get dirty and should you get hurt or something similar it will always only enhance your appearance with scars and injuries in all the right places. It also makes you exceptionally lucky with your appearance, even if you were to get transformed into something random it would always be something that people could find aesthetically pleasing. You are a 9 out of 10.%%%%This is also an appearance booster for the rest of the population so that even people who are overweight look better then they have any right to do. You are able to decide whether it applies only to you and companions or everyone at the start of each jump.,,
Demon - Don't Stop Me Now,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You are level 50 now. Hurray! Not only that you will not have to suffer through the level 50 soft cap on levels, or any soft cap on levels ever again. If it would normally be achievable within a system you may choose to experience a continual arithmetic experience requirement rather than a geometric or exponential one. You gain one title of your choice not offered elsewhere in this jump.,,
Dont Stop Me Now - What A Fancy Glass Hat,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Instead of being level 50, you have broken the level cap and become level 100. Even better! In the future you may ignore any hard cap to your max level in a system you are using.You gain one title of your choice not offered elsewhere in this jump.,,
What A Fancy Glass Hat - Once More With Feeling,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,Increase your level by 50. You gain one title of your choice not offered elsewhere in this jump. Can be purchased multiple times.,,
Unfair Advantage,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Choose 1 stat from among Endurance (Kinda like HP), Magic Power (Basically MP), Stamina (Like Stamina bar in action games), Strength (muscles without muscles?), Vitality (more like resistance), Dexterity (like dex plus agl), or Intelligence (not just how smart you are but how powerful your magic is) that you do not have disadvantage on. There are also the Agility and Mind stats based on setting choices.%%%%You gain a 25% comparative boost to that stat and for every 2 stat points you put into that stat (or a similar stat in different jumps) you will get one extra point in that stat. You may double up on a stat advantage gaining a 50% comparative boost and for every point you put into that stat you will get an extra point into that stat. You may put points into your advantaged stat over the limits.%%%%%%You MUST take the drawback Disadvantage once for each purchase of this perk for no additional cp, unless it is given by a racial origin.%%%%Each time you purchase this perk for CP it costs 50 CP more than the last time you purchased it, price starts at 50 CP.,,
I'm Quite Skilled You Know,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,Choose any two fairly common skills that could be available to you and isn't on offer elsewhere. You gain those skills and two sub skills of your choice to go with them. You could grab the skill [Fire Magic] and the spell [Fire Bolt] to go with it. Some skills require you to have a specific title to acquire and use and others require you to be of a specific race. You would need to acquire a dragon title or be a dragon to gain [Fire Magic: Dragon] and the spell [Dragons Fire Breath], or you would need a similar connection with elves to acquire [Archery: Elven] and [Elven Swift Shot] compared to normal archery skills.%%%%This perk can be purchased multiple times.,,
Have You Seen This Before?,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,Choose any one fairly uncommon or rare skill that could be available to you and isn't on offer elsewhere. You gain that skill and a sub skill of your choice to go with it. You could grab the skill [Magic Manipulation] and [Counter Spell] to go with it. Like some common skills, you may be required to have a specific title to acquire and use and others still require you to be of a specific race or faction. These skills are more powerful than common skills and can be so rare as to be believed to be unique, as only one person might have them.%%%%This perk can be purchased multiple times.,,
Special Snowflake,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Choose any skill or sub skill that is not on offer elsewhere in this jump, even unique skills regardless of requirements. You gain that skill. This could be a skill like [Phantasmagoric] which lets you rearrange your anatomy like an eldritch monstrosity or even acquire the legendary lost fire spell [Vermillion Lance]. You can create your own, as long as its power is similar to that of the other Unique Skills. Sometimes, in exchange for these potent abilities, Unique Skills can cause their users to become mentally and spiritually unstable due to overuse, but this CP-backed perk will not, unless you tako certain drawbacks.%%%%This perk can be purchased multiple times.,,
Titles,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,Gain two [Title] of your choice not on offer elsewhere in this jump. Some titles may be built off of or enhanced from other ones. You must purchase prerequisite attributes as needed.%%%%May purchase multiple times. (Titles to acquire lower tier skills such as elven magic only take 1 title, to acquire middle tier skills would require two titles in sequence such as demon slayer titles, and to acquire higher tier skills would require 3 or 4),,
Job,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,Gain one [Job] of your choice not on offer elsewhere in this jump. Some jobs may be built off of or enhanced from other ones. You must purchase prerequisite attributes as needed. Can be purchased multiple times.,,
Class,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Gain one [Class] of your choice not on offer elsewhere in this jump. Some classes may be built off of or enhanced from other ones. You must purchase prerequisite attributes as needed. Can be purchased multiple times.,,
Combo Breaker!,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Just like how Satoo's [King] and [Hero] [Titles] merged into one, you may choose any two titles you have to combine and strengthen them. You may not combine any of the 600cp titles with each other, and a title can only be combined once. Can be purchased multiple times.,,
In Today's Economy Sometimes You Need More Than One,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You gain an extra [Job] slot. This may or may not be more useful depending on the version of this setting you use. Does not come with a job. Can be purchased multiple times.,,
Back to School,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You gain an extra [Class] slot. Can be purchased multiple times.,,
[Jumper] of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Drag...,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,While not technically cannon, you gain an extra [Title] slot. Can be purchased multiple times. Have fun.,,
Welcome to [Menu]s and Stuff for all Your Shopping Needs,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Capstone Booster%%%%You have acquired Satou's most famous of unique skills [Menu], which functions as an incredibly robust and adjustable menu system and HUD as a means to interact directly with the gamer system of this world while acting as an improved amalgamation of other following skills:%%%%%%[Storage]; Unlimited and Timeless. Truly an infinite and well organized inventory system. Store enough water inside for actual tsunamis. In addition, crafting, deconstructing, and even manipulating items within is simple. Though not everything can be manipulated to a fine enough detail within it, Satou wasn't able to extract salt from saltwater with just this or brew potions.%%%%[Map]; expandable/shown if areas are explored, also shows a list of locations of those who were tagged as important.%%%%[Radar]; similar to [Map], but shows indicators and other information. Is capable of differentiating between foes, neutral parties, and people of special interest.%%%%[Map Search]; Expands the map in an area you have not yet explored, updates and stores entire cartographical information, and incorporates any data received from external sources and makes searching maps easy.%%%%[Column List]; able to edit self-info and reorganize the [Menu] to more easily search for information or fool a [Status Check] like skill or ability, except those of higher order or strength.%%%%[Memo Pad] Allows you to write down your thoughts and contains photocopy capabilities in addition to allowing Satou to use it like a search engine for books that he reads in AR.%%%%[AR] is also known as [Augmented Reality]. Has the ability to photograph, scan, and manipulate structures in a CAD Computer Aided Design. Data is also interchangeable with other systems.%%%%[Magic Column] has a list in the AR that shows all the spells that you have ever used and simply reading or selecting the spell from the menu causes it to be cast without the use of chant and bypasses the need for rituals, somatic, or verbal elements. Components can be pulled [Storage].%%%%[Recipe Column] details the construction process of all the items you have ever made ranging from improvised weapons to magic potions.%%%%[Self Status] You can review, analyze, and apply your stat and aspect distributions and selections.%%%%[Analyse] It is an amalgamation of [Appraisal] and [Status Check]. It's similar to other [Status Check]s but unlike them it is also able to see their HP, SP and MP and it can detect if a person is using a skill or ability to lie or hide about their status. It also has the same skills as appraisal in terms of determining the status and capability of items.%%%%[Clock] The menu also comes with a clock and a calendar.%%%%[Automatic loot] If you or your allies were to kill enemies within the range, items that remain that could even be of remote use are automatically put into your inventory. Things such as corpses and animal parts count too. You may also selectively add things within range directly to storage.%%%%[Log] informs him of any direct action against him and informs him if he gains any skill or title%%%%[Unknown] Satou also has the unusual ability to pierce through space and spatial barriers with his%%bare hands and body.%%%%[Integration] Many different spells and items that require some sort of control or command can be controlled via the menu.%%%%%%These do not describe everything shown or done with this menu/gamer system. In addition to this skill, you will be able to assign skill and stat points however you wish and receive an additional +5 skill points and 1 extra stat point each level. You achieve new titles and the ability to buy into far more skills compared to other people at a massively accelerated rate, simply seeing or being hit once with a fire shot spell can be enough to acquire the options to buy into magic resistance, fire resistance, fire magic, fire magic resistance, and the specific spell. Killing a single creature of a creature type will award you the slayer title for it and having one small fall could grant you a feather fall skill. This perk will integrate with and incorporate any other gamer or system style perks you have or will acquire.,,
God,,1,,-10000,,False,,True,,Congratulations, you are now a God. While you are not yet on par with the human gods of this world, such as Parion, Tenion, and Zaikuon, etc., you are simply beyond what most beings are capable of understanding. Physically you are quite powerful, but the real seat of your power is in the ethereal and spiritual realms. There aren't really any clear comparisons that we are given to the full capabilities of gods, partially because they exist beyond the system itself and partially because they aren't as thoroughly analyzed as they should have been, as such we are going to make some guesswork and just shotgun this.%%%%Firstly, in any system that has a randomized number of stats or skills given each level, you will always get the maximum number available. What does that mean for this jump where we've already provided a set average? You will start with an extra 5 points in every stat, gain 5 extra skill points per level, and 1 extra stat point per level. Second, you have a +100% or 2 times additive divine multiplier on everything after all other boosts. (Aka As a Human Deity with 50 strength, you'd be twice as strong as a Human with the same 50.) Any time you gain a skill whether in this jump or otherwise, you will also gain another skill representing the same thing except this is a [Godly: Skill] that is similar to a unique skill version of the same skill but beyond the system.%%%%You will gain a [Deity] => [Race], [Class], [Job], [Skill], and [Title] that occupy their own exclusive slot boosting all the other attributes you have equipped or are benefiting from.You have a flat 90% damage, debuff, and duration reduction that will combine with any other reductions, such that if you had a 50% damage reduction you would have a 95% damage reduction, another 90% would give your 99%, another 90% and another 50% would give you a 99.5% These defences can not be bypassed by even godly sources and all of your abilities pierce everything else's defences by the same rate.%%%%You will gain a full {Authority} of your choice, this represents what you are primarily the god of and is an expression of power and control in the world far beyond the system itself. Your {Authority} could be something like {Sun} providing an influence over clear physical aspects such as light, fire, and the sky, but also metaphorical aspects such as hope, cycles, or tyranny. This authority can taint all your other abilities.%%%%As a god you are immortal, while normally gods could reform given time if they were to be destroyed and are fully able to operate in the spiritual world after their body is destroyed, you will simply get a one-up. You are ageless and have no true biological needs such as sleep, eating, or even breathing or need for upkeep and can thrive in extreme conditions such as outer space or even survive on the surface of the sun.. Your body can reasonably take on any form that your stats can support, or you can simply express all your power through the shape of a rabbit or dragonfly or even more intangible things like a giant shining cloud with only the things able to pierce your defences able to pierce your form, even if you had a limb chopped off it would instantly reform and you would simply have a representational loss of health or energy, you don't even have to bleed if you don't want every hit causing hard light sparks of your aura to shatter across the wind with each strike. You have a unique aura that is deeply connected with any expression of yourself, and can be used to enhance the awe, terror, mesmerizing, or beauty factor of your presence by an order of magnitude.%%%%You can now design your own [Holy Magic: Jumper] that you may freely allow any being to use as you wish or allow. It is an expression of your godly powers and will grow in strength and capability based on the amount of divine power you wield. You can travel through local dimensions to a minor extent, and can teleport to and appear wherever you hold a seat of power or one of your worshippers reside. You can transition freely between your ethereal and material states, possess people and objects, wielding their abilities freely. You can split off small aspects of your soul to haunt,watch, possess, bless, or function like guardian angels to specific people and places.%%%%Lastly you have the [Deity] skill, at level 10 so to speak, representing your outside of system powers, your actual godly capabilities vs the system. You start off 10% beyond any system, not just the game and magic systems present in this world but the literal laws of physics. You aren't 10% stronger, but 10% beyond the concept of strength itself able to provide leverage, torque and range where there were none, or forge metals that are both 10% lighter and 10% denser and 10% heavier and 10% sharper than the very laws of physics permits.%%%%You can build up your divine power by accumulating divinity or by coelessing miasma *See Notes. These resources are spent to achieve a wide variety of effects. You can also grow your powers and soul by handing out percentages of your power or cultivated [Unique Skills] to people to then collect on their powers, energy, and souls when they die. It's your choice how corrupting you wish your powers to be on others. With that said, with your current accumulation of excess power, you can only create about three new [Unique Skills] or a single [Authority] of your design. These two resources are used for a whole lot of applications by the gods such as crafting treasures, creating matter, overcharging spells and abilities along with the creation of beings like apostle's or demons.%%%%If you are not one of the human gods you must be one of another tribe or other race, as such you will gain a second {authority} representing this race or groups of races such as {birds}, {demons}, or {dragons} such that you hold power of these species in all future jumps and anytime you enter a jump you may have these species begin to populate the world all similar species functioning a familiars for yourself. Here are 100,000 followers to act as worshippers and faithful, knights, templars, and priests of your faith, they are split up in power based upon the strength of race you individually purchase here where if you had bought dragon about 1% would be on par with dragons, 10% on par with demons and the like, and 90% on par with demi humans. (feel free to design a new species not originally seen in this world like snake - Naga or bird - Aarakocra, but once designed and the {authority} chosen it is set) Increasing your worshipers by an order of magnitude may at most increase your abilities beyond by 1%. Any followers and companions will count amongst your faithfull.%%%%While it is stated several times that gods are omniscient and omnipresent, this is simply not true. As a god you can possess a vast and near absolute awareness of everything that happens within a large range around you, if you choose to focus on such things, at your level of power that range is probably around ten thousand miles and you may freely just appear wherever and however you want within that range, but you do have a diminishing awareness and ability to translocate beyond that. Your eyes and other senses possess a constant true sight able to see that which is invisible or touch what is intangible. These abilities of perception extend into overlapping dimensions such as the ethereal plane and even slightly multiversal planes such as parallel worlds, realities, and timelines. But be warned a few beings have the ability to hide from your view and areas can be protected against it or even your travel.%%%%You will gain your own personal sub dimension representing you divine realm that will travel with you between jumps, it is completely up to your design and acts as a seat to your power, it may be incorporated into any greater cosmology and gives you power over the spiritual afterlife of your faithful or others that you may hold or position such claims over their souls.,,
Dreamer - I Remember This,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You may have just entered the world, but you aren't completely clueless. You have either similar experiences from a video game in your old world or have the memories of a childhood in this one. Whenever you enter a new jump you will get a quick briefing and summary covering everything important in the world you are entering. This also acts as a minor luck boost.,,
Dreamer - [Hidden Power Manager],,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Regardless of how overpowered you are, sometimes you just want to enjoy a normal life. This perk gives you the ability to hide your crazy powers and appear just like any generic citizen of this world. It protects you from all sorts of detection so if someone hasn’t seen you use the power, they’ll never find out. If you also have some sort of interface, it gives you the ability to customize what is shown to other people. Like Satoo, you get the ability to lower any of your powers in intensity (on a scale of 0 - 10) or shut them off completely if you want to. You can either do this in your mind or use your interface(should you already have one it’s going to get integrated).,,
Dreamer - Unique Soul,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Well, aren't you special. In all of the multiverse there isn't anyone else quite like you, that's because you just happen to be the combination of almost all of the different versions of yourself across said multiverse. Firstly your soul and by extension your soul vessel has expanded by several orders of magnitude in power, capability, and resilience, but that doesn't really lead to much direct power. Secondly, you will find memories, skills, and familiarities with events hidden away inside yourself making it much harder to be caught off guard and much easier to relate to other people and their experiences. And lastly, it's no longer possible to copy you, your powers, or creations perfectly depending on the relative skill or ability of the copier there is always something that makes it clearly not you or yours, everything you do and are has a uniquely you feel that simply can't be denied. You may selectively toggle elements of this as needed to hide, forge, or impersonate, ect.,,
Dreamer - [All Map Exploration],,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Once per jump, or every 10 years whichever comes first. You may instantaneously know the exact whereabouts of any beings or items within and the general layout of a given territory. Nothing can be hidden from the perception of this perk's use, not even gods or warded locations. You will also gain the skills [trap discovery] and [treasure discovery] and the spell version of the [All Map Exploration] along with [Nature Magic: Foreign World].,,
Dreamer - Engineer,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Wow, aren't you the smart one, or is it just that the entire world seems like it was built from the ground up by an alternate version of yourself? Either way, your intuition, creativity, and ingenuity have been massively enhanced. Additionally, you can now learn in days what would take others years to learn (if you need an exact number learning multiplier, let's say 50).%%%%But more importantly, you now know how to craft any fiat backed items you own and can easily develop new items or combine the techniques and knowledge together in unique ways or understand substitutions and the differences they make. It can function like a path of victory for crafting, granting intermediary knowledge needed, such as: you own a computer, you will have the knowledge of all the steps needed to build the devices needed to build the computer.%%%%Whether you have the actual capability to do so is another story, just because you know how to make gold coins and completely understand their structure doesn't mean you can just create gold out of thin air. And something like a magic book filled with all the engineering knowledge of a planet, this perk would only provide you the knowledge and skills to make an infinite book not the contents inside of it.,,
Dreamer - [Meteor Storm],,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Three times per jump, you may call down divine meteors, killing everything in a defined area and destroying a substantial portion of that area (area limited to about a continent to begin). This can easily kill gods and spiritual beings, I didn't stutter when I said everything, please do not waste them. You will also gain the [Disaster Magic] and [Destruction Magic] skills, along with the [Meteor Storm] spell, which is a much weaker and limited but still very powerful version of this perk, plus the [Authority]. This is the only way to get the [Meteor Storm] spell in jump.,,
Boosted [Meteor Storm] - [Indestructible] [God Slayer],,1,,00,,False,,True,,Whelp, looks like you have the [Indestructible] [Skill], sorry no you're not actually indestructible. If your body is destroyed, you can continue on as an ethereal ghost, moving and even interacting with the world selectively to a large extent and you may also reconstitute yourself anytime you wish. While the protagonist can use this as much as he likes, you only get it as a one-up that can be used in tandem and combination with your other one-ups. It does provide a minor boost to all defences and resiliency through especially to your ethereal or spiritual self and aspects, say 5% and 15% respectively.%%%%Seems you've also killed a God, lucky you! don't sweat it they aren't mad about it or anything, they actually probably planned it so they could give you all this stuff. To start with, you've got the [God Slayer] title, making you much more effective against gods and god-like beings . A good portion of your resistances and defences will hold up in the face of anything including but not limited to gods, along with all of your attacks and powers over penetrating anything defence at about a 20% proportional rate.%%%%While the title is equipped you will gain a multiplier against god-like beings up to 2 against actual gods in all your abilities, aka that 20% pierce would function as a 25% pierce against greater demons, 30% against demon lords, and 40% against gods. A bit blasphemous but you can wield the clerical powers of the gods as your own, you gain a [Holy Magic] of your design or choice to represent the god you killed and you may purchase [Holy] skills, even using them against the very gods who created them, as the power originates from you now.%%%%Lasty, here have a one time lump sum of 50 levels, a fragment of an {Authority} also know as an [Authority], 5 holy "swords" ranging in power from average to well above average of any type and style you like, 10 insanely high quality magic weapons of your design, 100 handguns, 50 rifles, 10 magic-guns, 5 magic-rifles, 100 magic and enchanted or blessed dragon skin armors, 100 magic and enchanted or blessed dragon scale armors, 10,000 pieces of dragon themed weapons and jewelry of various materials upto Mythril,Hihiirokane, and even Orichalcum with strong magical effects, 20,000 pieces of scale tribe mundane weapons and armor, 10,000,000 hefty gold dragon coins (30g each) (~303 metric tonnes of 24-carat gold by weight), 40,000 Saga Empire Gold Coin (7g each), 10,000 Ancient Empire silver and copper coins, 7,000 coins of various sizes and materials from many kingdoms, and 30,000 Furu Empire crimson treasures (~15g each)(red coin philosopher's stones), the dragon gods fang, and 79,600,000 assorted items and materials such as but not limited to iron ingots, copper ingots, medicinal plants, timber, and stone, random body parts, scales, and even hole corpses of lizardmen, dragonewts, dragons, and the god you killed. (I leave the specifics to you on this),,
Reincarnator - Straight Dealing,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You happen to be a princess reincarnated from another world, or a demon with the face of a wolf? No problem, everyone will be far more receptive of you and your ideas, even if they buck against tradition. You won't have people discrediting your work because you just happen to have hair of an ill omen color or belong to a tribe of knife ears. Comes with a general charisma boost.,,
Reincarnator - Good thing I was a [...],,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Well, you are a reincarnated being. Meaning you've had a past life or two. As such whenever you enter a jump including this one design a normal past life for yourself, maybe you were a school teacher, maybe you were a fisherman, an olympic athlete anything within the limits of a normal human or your race. You will gain all of the skills and experiences that come from these lives. Additionally you will find that these lives provide particularly relevant or useful experiences to your new life.,,
Reincarnator - [Multiple Personality Disorder],,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Ok, this is getting weird, how many of you are there? Three ok, there are three of you... for now. You can now spend 30 levels whenever you want to create an independent personality, this personality's level will always be half of your ultimate total level.%%%%Aka, if you are at level 60 and spend 30 levels to create a personality you have two 30 level personalities or modes you can access. Your new total level is 90 but this comes with some caveats, first you've already spent 60 of those levels to gain two personalities. So your main personality is level 30, but your alt personalities are level 45 each. If you were to gain 50 levels , your ultimate total level would be 140, but you would be level 80 and each other personality would be 70, and you could spend 30 to be level 50 and each personality would still be 70 but you have three personalities.%%%%Second, you may design each personality as you wish when you create them and each may maintain separate memories as needed. Each personality may assign stat and skill points separately from the main you but each must maintain 50% of the points as the main you has set for each. For every 4 [Skills] you have, you will get another skill of equal quality for each other personality, which is exclusive for that personality's use. Choose 50% of your skills, titles, classes, jobs, and stats, these are held by all personalities. Once a skill is chosen it can not be changed out . Your other personalities can not have more skills than the main you. Sub skills can be completely changed out under different personalities.,,
Reincarnator - Luck of the Draw,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Seems like most of the reincarnated around here really get the short end of the stick, with more than half of them turning into some kind of undead monster or other, though they do get to be better than the common local. You have picked up on this and have gained an extra [Race] and slot to support it, along with two appropriate [Skills] an [Sub Skills]. This race needs to be something like undead, lich, vampire, ghost possessed armor, or even something like werewolf or something as simple as monster%%%% You will gain this monstrous form as alt forms for all of your other forms and or added traits while the [Race] is equipped. Additionally, you are just better than your monstrous peers, any racial advantages that are normally experienced by any monstrous race you happen to be a member of are significantly enhanced beyond the norm for the alpha of that race, such as your senses, speed, reflexes, and strength for a werewolf or a vampires stealth, durability, hypnosis, and charm. Any racial weakness that may be present in you significantly reduced such that vampires that could only survive two minutes in sunlight could go four minutes and only receive half the damage, even when being a super awesome vampire means you would die instantly. (You get the best of all worlds),,
Reincarnator - Without Corruption,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Many years into the summoning cycle, the Demon God rigged some of the [Unique Skills] given to the reincarnated. These Unique Skills eventually caused a loss of sanity with overuse and the collapse of the soul, turning the people who possessed such things into Demon Lords, with those having too many of those skills suffering the same fate. This is not the case with you. No matter which abilities, powers, perks, entities, or items you gain or wield, you will never be negatively affected by them or denied their power, whether from possessing them, being possessed by them, or from using them, or any other weird tag along inconveniences that come along with them.,,
Reincarnator - [Demon Lord],,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Congrats, I guess? You now have the [Demon Lord] title making one of the strongest beings that plague this world. You are now a good bit more powerful than a regular [Hero] without even equipping the title. Whereas a [Hero] and [True Hero] get a major overall improvement across the board for their stats and skills, you get a mild improvement across the board but an insane boost in a specific area or archetype of your choice.%%%%You can now acquire [Demon] skills, any powers that could be described as dark, evil, unholy, or demonic are improved by about 50%, and you are equally effective at destroying and resisting the powers of dark, evil, unholy, or demonic. Equipping this title makes you much more powerful than a regular [Hero] and a good bit more powerful than a [True Hero], usually requiring a party consisting of a [Hero] and a team of similarly skilled people, all around your same level for you to be defeated and improving your powers over darkness and against light.%%%%What truly separates you from others is the absolute strangeness of your nature and powers, your very being infecting all your [Skills] and abilities mixing in strange and unique ways, having ice magic allows you to create cold fire or regen causing temporary hardening and strengthening of the flesh. Equipping this title pushes your admixtures to the extreme further reinforcing their bizarre nature and lessening their weaknesses and enhancing strengths.%%%%To show off your status as a simply better being take these 50 levels and a free [Unique Skill] (which should technically come from Demon God or consolidated miasma, but we will make an exception).,,
Boosted [Demon Lord] - [ - - - - ],,1,,00,,False,,True,,Well it seems that you have transcended the boundaries of your form and your soul has collapsed, or not as the case may be. So, many of the various demon lords' powers are centered around the manipulation and acquisition of power because their very existence is a plot to do so. You now hold all their gifts to a weakened extent.%%%%Similar to the Dog-Headed demon's abilities to steal powers or hide from detection, you will not only grow stronger from slaying creatures of the light, but may actively steal fragments of powers, abilities, and skills from anything you defeat and no acts of premonition or clairvoyance will see you coming%%%%Like the Black and Boar demons you may reduce your level and or HP/MP/SP and split off pieces of yourself to become faithful servants and summons that can go off and collect memories and experiences and power for you, able to remerge, healing you by more than double what it took to make, resists large amounts, and shapeshift to an extreme degree.%%%%Or similar to the Goblin demon's power, you can mass replicate any of the [Skills] you acquire and hand out watered down versions of them or imbue them into objects.%%%%If you want powers equal or technically greater in strength and versatility to the main demon lords mentioned here you will have to have many many [Unique skills] to cover the differences for each one. Such as these two free [Unique Skills]. These powers are not tied to your [Title] but not having it equipped will greatly reduce them further; anything you kill beyond providing the usual experience will ever so slightly strengthen the weight of your title.%%%%The last gift of this is your ability to manipulate and utilize miasma directly, growing stronger and more powerful as you take in more as your form is partially composed of the substance and acts as a vessel for it, the substance is much weaker than divinity but has a multitude of uses such as acting like a poison, corrosive agent or corrupting souls or even apostles. With enough of it you could even create monsters or demons, infuse or forge it into weapons and armor or enchantments, cast spells with it in place of mana.%%%%It's a sad fact that the Demon God doesn't have true apostles, this is due to the nature of his power but were this boost lacks the raw power provided by the other capstones upfront it makes up for it by granting you endless potential one day you to may reach the heights of the four great demon kings who live in the moon or even dare I say the Dog-Head Demon in his prime and beyond.,,
Summoned Hero - Monkey Wrench,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It really sucks getting pulled into another world without any say of your own and being tricked into thinking you're the good guy when in truth you are just another part of some machiavellian plot for power.%%%%No longer shall this stand, whenever someone summons you, you will have a distinct awareness of who is summoning you and why you are actually being summoned, it won't be so specific that you know what their full plan is but you'll know whether your just a decoy or stand in and whether the person who summoned you is secretly the bad guy. Works in reverse on the things you happen to summon and comes with some protections such as your charisma, willpower, and luck working in tandem to help you resist unwanted side effects of summoning or secretly undermine the other, but nothing absolute or particularly powerful.%%%%This does provide one guarantee though, you can not be ordered to kill yourself by a summoner, any attempts to do so will fail even from another effect or spell. Being summoned doesn't have to be magical, even a request will do.,,
Summoned Hero - Where Did You Find That?,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,As a great and noble hero you have got to have the best equipment and while people may often be willing to shower you with gifts, the best treasures come from adventure. You have a disturbingly high chance of finding whatever you need whenever you need it, the shop keeper will suddenly remember were there were a few extra rolls of toilet paper even when they should have been sold out for weeks, you'll be sitting on the ground and notice a pretty flower that just happens to be a very very uncommon alchemy ingredient, and you'll probably find four and five leaf clovers on a daily basis. Yes yes, the kingdom regularly refills the local training dungeon with treasure, so why exactly was a legendary lost weapon found there? because of you, that's why.%%%%You might not always get what you want, but you'll get something. Counts as a general luck boost.,,
Summoned Hero - Activation Phrase,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Some magical objects in this place require a cry of some sort to use their special abilities, namely the holy swords. This isn’t the case for you%%%%Whatever objects or abilities you use, you do not have to do anything to telegraph your attacks by shouting, speaking, waving, or whatever would reveal your intended action. You can now use any item, skill, spell without shouting some stupid combination of words or do a silly dance that might give away what you are trying to do.,,
Summoned Hero - Better Toys for Better Living,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Demon Lords and Monsters may outpace Heroes in raw power, but heroes are uniquely prepared, as mentioned previously. They don't just have the best equipment, they bring out the best from their equipment, any items or artifacts you wield are twice as powerful, effective, and durable, ect, in your possession as they are with other people.,,
Summoned Hero - Corrupted Within,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,While many people percieve Parion to be a noble, righteous, and kind goddess, for all intents and purposes she is more cruel and manipulative than the Demon God ever attempted to be. She pushes others around like expendable pawns and risks their lives to the corruption she brought into the world.%%%%While this perk provides no protection from the corruption or the ill effects of outside forces, items or powers you use, you will grow ever stronger and more dangerous as negative and cursed forces claim you. A curse strong enough to take your life would see your power and ferocity grow by an order of magnitude by the time you reached your final minutes. You may willingly accelerate your own corruption to gain these benefits and you may also now enter a a berserker state similar to a barbarians rage increasing your resistances and strength for a period of time, but after which you will experience fatigue, exhaustion, stress and will be more susceptible to corruption.,,
Summoned Hero - [True Hero],,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Huh, it appears that you have already defeated a demon lord, thus granting you the [True Hero] title. You are now a good bit more powerful than a regular [Hero] without even equipping the title.%%%%Whereas a [Demon Lord] gets a mild improvement across the board but an insane boost in a specific area to fit an archetype, you get major overall improvement across the board for your stats and skills.%%%%You can now acquire [Divine] skills, any powers that could be described as light, good, holy, and divine are improved by about 50%, and you are equally effective at destroying and resisting the powers of dark, evil, unholy, or demonic.%%%%Equipping this title improves your powers over light and against darkness and makes you much more powerful than a regular [Hero] but a bit weaker than a [Demon Lord]. But what sets you truly apart from a [Demon Lord] is your oneness of self, your body just feels lighter to you, more freedom of movement, your will power boosted to match your new self confidence and understanding, and you understand your limits perfectly operating at up to 90% of you peak without any effort or stain.%%%%With the title equipped you can operate at 99% of your peak effortlessly and your force of will grows greater, being able to push yourself with great effort and strain to actually operate at 110% and truly become on par with a [Demon Lord]. To show off your achievements here are 50 levels and a free [Unique Skill] (which should technically come from the God Parion, but we will make an exception).,,
Boosted [True Hero] - [Half Apostle],,1,,00,,False,,True,,Most apostles are automatons crafted from raw divinity and brought forth from the seedbed, but every so often a mortal will be so infused, creating a half apostle.,,
Local - Inconspicuous,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Being a local of this world gives you an Aura that makes you a really uninteresting target for the plot and potential BBEGs. As long as you don't do anything out of order, most people are just gonna ignore you. Can be toggled, but if you intentionally break the illusion it has a cooldown of about 24 Hours. Owning or managing a shop or inn is now easy for you. Minor charisma boost.,,
Local - Plot Magnet,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The opposite of Inconspicuous, this perk gives you good chances to just randomly stumble into the plot. Whether it’s a Hero who decides to be friends with you or some random villain takes you hostage, it almost feels like you are being pulled into the plot regardless of what you do. Cannot be used with Inconspicuous but can be toggled and or scaled based on the setting to allow for big or small adventures to just fall into your lap. Comes with minor luck boost, especially in rewards or interest in these plots and a small protection against the dangers of these plots.,,
Local - Knighthood,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Functionally, this is a mostly late period medieval setting with magic and as such one of the "easiest" ways to raise your station in life or prevent your complete descent into serfdom as the eighth born son of a noble is to join with the military or knights. It looks like you have done just that or something similar presently or in the past. You get a set of [Titles], [Jobs], [Classes], and two mundane [Skills] like [Marksman] or [Swordsman], representing your new station and skills. Your body has been reforged to the pinnacle of ability through decades of training and actual combat experience (even if you're a kid somehow).%%%%Whenever you start to learn a new form of martial training or art you suddenly have a decade of practical experience focused in that art. Your physical abilities and skills will not diminish over time. Mechanically this is also granted as a flat +5 to all physical abilities score and a 5% boost to them.,,
Local - Knight in the Hood, Witch in the Woods,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,This world is far older than the system implemented by the Demon God and Parion, old magics powers, and bloodlines that the system only begins to scratch at. The system does not define every power, but it does denote them so others can conceptualize what they are and tries to limit their influence in the world. But you have subverted these systems, general suppressions of powers, skills, and actions through either a manipulation of the very mechanics of the universe or as an act of law, they simply don't apply to you anymore if the intent was to suppress. The entire community could ban witchcraft, the ability of citizens to arm themselves, and be in the middle of the witch trials or fuedal and yet they would not bring actions against you unless your specificly commiting other kinds of crimes, such as assault or murder with your actions. There is an aura of fear and intimidation that crossing the line against you would lead to grave repercussions, this wont stop particularly ambitious individuals from trying to accomplish their goals, but they won't be convincing the masses to rally against you, unless you harm those people personally. You gain two rare [Skills] and subs skills of your choice, and may acquire skills, titles, jobs, and classes representing these old world traits, bloodlines, and powers which lie outside the system.,,
Local - It's Great to Be King,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Nobility in this world is a powerful thing, it's not that the people don't necessarily want to rise up against the nobles for being jerks, it's that the nobility get a lot of nice benefits in this world that make such a thing impractical. Now, you too can share in these benefits. You get a set of [Titles], [Jobs], [Classes], and even two fairly mundane [Skills] like [Accounting] or [Politics] to represent your actual station, such as just noble, or duchess, or even king (though it's kind of like how aladin is king without a kingdom).%%%%From now on whenever you like, you will possess an air of authority about you that is unquestionably noble whether for good or tyranny, providing a massive boost to charisma, persuasion, intimidation, influence, and such things.%%%%Secondly, you are a sovereign and will always have a sovereign immunity wherever you may find yourself, protecting you from taxes, jail, or other similar issues.%%%%Lastly, you have an extreme boost in capabilities, defenses, and power wherever you hold claim, the more claim over a territory you have the stronger the boost is upto 150% and you may apply negatives within your territories up to -50% on others based on those same claims. These attributes are closely tied in with luck and administration of a kingdom.,,
Local - Miko of the Jumper Temple,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Aren't you the charming one, well the gods seem to think so at least. Wherever you go, gods and spirits both natural, angelic, and demonic just seem to like you and are far more predispositioned to help you out, not screw you over in deals, listen to your petitions or just hangout even if you are currently the priest of an enemies temple.%%%%It might have something to do with the fact that you now have an immense willpower and purity of conviction and faith in whatever you selectively choose to believe in, or that any of your offerings and sacraments empowers them far more than even a small army of zealots, your worship alone could sustain a god (though, wouldn't make them very powerful by itself), whatever the reasons, these kinds of beings genuinely like you, will shower you with gifts and blessing, and do a lot more to get you to be their MIKO.%%%%So what is a Miko, well it is a shrine maiden, a practitioner of faith that helps protect, watchover, and supplicate a temple. But due to the nature of this world, they also tend to be like holy knights and paladins to a minor degree, some fall more on the warrior side and some fall more one the healer side. You now have the [Miko] title, job, and class (we don't actually see a class, for this but you get it anyway). You also gain the [Holy Magic] skill of your choice for any of the gods in setting granting you powers based on that god, or make up your own god and it will be one of the other tribes that survived the massacre of the Dog-Headed Demon.%%%%You will gain the [Oracle] skill which puts a kind of divine telepathic radio into your head, allowing you to communicate, recieve messages, visions, prophecies, and even a level of clairvoyance with the gods, the afterlife, divine realms, the system itself, and even the natural world (lets you even talk with trees and plants and rocks, no one can mess with it, so gods couldn't disguise a vision as a prophecy to deceive or gaslight you) .%%%%All divine channeling abilities are strengthened and you will receive several blessings from your god, empowering you and allowing you to function beyond normal limits, though not to a level of a [Hero], however with your [Miko] title equipped you would still be just below a [Hero] in personal physical capability, you have better boosts across the board, and all the spiritual powers and blessing you channel are improved by two fold. You have been granted an [Authority] or more specifically a fragment of an {Authority}.%%%%You may purchase [Holy Skills].,,
Boosted Miko of the Jumper Temple - Wakemitama,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Huh, turns out you are actually a piece of a god. You were created for a very specific purpose or role to fill, but you won't be subject to your god and can even turn against them if you like. You are no longer intrinsically under the system, but are now a part of the system itself and maybe a bit above it. You were most likely split off and forged for the purpose of resurrecting the god in case of their death or to act as a gate into the physical world.%%%%As such, you will gain a one-up to bring yourself back from the dead once per jump or ever 10 years, whichever comes first, and you can sacrifice yourself to summon anything/anyone fully and alive (or just their corpse if you really want) into the world bypassing any obstacle, even such as death, timelocks, or dimensional prisons. (this could be used offensively to force someone hold up in their personal dimension out and to confront you)%%%%Entities are even more charmed by you and the benefits you offer, but more importantly they are more generous with their gifts and now have a high level of respect for you, even as an enemy.%%%%As a fragment of a god you are quite powerful allowing you to compete with a Lvl 100 [Hero] and pushing your channeled powers and blessings to be an order of magnitude greater without even having attributes filled.%%%%As you are an actual aspect of a god, you no longer rely on the continued blessings of other beings, once a blessing or power is granted it is a part of you and you are now the source.%%%%Once per jump you may choose a set of powers and blessings gained from a being or being part of a particular faith and they will continue with you, fiat backed.%%%%You may gain two more [Authorities] or turn a previous [Authority] into an {Authority}.,,
Basic Gear,,2,,00,,False,,True,,You get a basic set of clothes, boots, gloves, a nice cloak, a travel bag of holding, and an infinite water skin. These are self repairing, self cleaning, and very comfy in all climate conditions. Can be imported as any set of clothing that you already have. You can’t pull out or store items that won't fit through the opening of the bag of holding, but it also has limitless storage capacity. Unlike the [Storage] sub-skill of [Menu], the bag is not timeless and as such food will deteriorate. An water skin is of a very high quality and will produce an infinite amount of fresh, perfectly pure, and clean water as can pass through the head.,,
Pets,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,You may pick any mundane or semi-magical animal, like a unicorn, within this world. You now have a completely loyal pet of that type. They will always be healthy and in whatever age category you want, if lost by any means they will reappear by your side or in your warehouse within 24 hours. You can purchase any animals you have previously owned to grant them fiat backing and these abilities.,,
[Maze Master] Core,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,Congratulations! You are now the owner of a pretty big maze or labyrinth. While this was an attempt to recreate a City Core, it actually failed on many levels and ended up being closer to a Dungeon Core in function, which oddly fits the intended purpose of the facility better. Either way, it is still an immensely powerful object and place.%%%%The maze and core do not grow over time, but it does sucks up magic power from its surrounding and refines it into magic cores which can then be used by it's facilities. The maze has three prototyping facilities. A facility to cultivate monsters, a facility that produces golems, and a facility to create dolls that act as servants, all of which can range anywhere between level 1-30.%%%%The maze can generate a staggering number of monsters and servants with the ability to equip them with level appropriate gear, enough to output and maintain armies if need be. It will generate all the resources and materials requested of it as it can produce from mundane materials of any kind, mythril, magic cores, and any parts of monsters or animals needed that could be acquired within the 30 level range. The maze has an explosive self-destruct system. The maze can consist of anywhere between 20 levels of 500 meters diameter floors with systemically perpendicular passages up to a 200 level colossal monstrosity of a maze tree that pierces the sky.%%%%Just like any Core, the owner of it is granted an immense amount of power, enough to rival a level 30 human and within the maze itself more than doubling these boons, having near absolute control and power to reconfigure the maze to desire, monitor everything inside, or keep others out.%%%%Comes with surrounding spirit populated forests, a couple of dryads, and a mountain range to boot.%%%%May be dropped into any jump or turned into a warehouse attachment. Everything produced is backed.,,
Dungeon Core,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Well, it seems that you hit the jackpot. You now own a dungeon core, which is capable of everything the maze core is and so much more.%%%%It grants you power able to rival a level 90 Demon [Demon Lord] and, within the territories it grants you, near-absolute control and power over the surroundings so that you could put a god in timeout.%%%%You can produce rare magical items like Gift Orbs, Holy Swords, Magic Sword, Mythril, Orichalcum, Hihiirokane and so much more from your Dungeon Points. The entire Dungeon and Core system was designed to collect, regulate, convert, and produce magic, miasma, and souls. As it performs these functions it generates Dungeon Points which can be spent to improve, increase, expand, grow, empower, and generate, ect, items, the dungeon itself, the core, and a myriad of other things and it does this through the core function.%%%%The dungeon is starting at 3 times the size of the maze and surrounding areas included are easily 10 times larger. Even in worlds where there is nothing similar to souls, miasma, or magic this dungeon will still generate at the base level, 3 times greater in capacity for amount, level, and rarity monsters and resources created.%%%%While normal dungeon cores in this world forbid you from leaving or getting too far away from the dungeon and or handing over your [Dungeon Lord] title to others. This version allows you to move your dungeon, leave the dungeon, and give ownership or sub-ownership of this dungeon to others.%%%%This dungeon can be imported into any future jump and/or act as a warehouse attachment.,,
Dreamer - Cellphone,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,It's a very nice cellphone of your choice with a few minor upgrades. It can attach itself to any kind of cell, radio, internet, or satellite signal it comes into contact allowing for free undetectable , untraceable, and encrypted use. It can run off your ambient magic, has a massively increased storage capacity, a much higher quality camera and video both front and back facing, never strains its cpu no matter how many tasks it tries to complete at once, comes preloaded with all your favorite apps even new better more user friendly ones designed by you, games, music, books, and movies. Not to mention several websites of your choice for offline use. (Wait, didn't he have an early 2000s flip phone... Don't look a gift phone in the mouth),,
Dreamer - Carriage,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Here you got a pretty darn big carriage that is way too big for the two horses pulling it, but still it comes in a design of your choice, closed/open, cloth/ all wood/metal trim, black/brown/ rainbow flowers, ect has no problems crossing ridiculously challenging natural terrain and is substantial faster than a carriage should be soit can be used as an escape. The horses, or really any fairly mundane animal or heck feel free to make it a golem carriage, never tire or need maintenance and are completely loyal.%%%%The interior of the carriage is bigger on the inside but not by insane amounts but still it is noticeable enough that ten people can sleep in this thing without being crammed in like sardines and there is still supposedly tons of space for it to operate as a full merchant shipping carriage and then some. And even if you go with an open face design, the interior is somehow climate control and pest free at all times. Can actually travel to hell and back safely.%%%%Exact specifications are up to you.,,
Dreamer - Trazayuya’s Blueprints,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,In these papers are extensive information on the creation of magic and holy weapons, the creation and manipulation of city and dungeon cores, the complete process to make the maze cores, traps, and even flying ships, and that’s just scratching the surface. These papers contain all the knowledge, research, schematics, and experimentation in the fields of crafting, metallurgy, carpentry, herbology, medicine, alchemy, zoology, architecture, engineering, technology, and magic ,ect (academia in general), known within the world both widely and by a select few geniuses, along with the beginnings of research and experimentation into any lost or forgotten technology that will get you halfway between the currently available tech and the lost tech. (IE, you would have half the R&D process between the Maze Core and the lost art of making City Cores already available when you enter the jump)%%%%These papers are heavily notated with references and counter references needed to learn from them but it would still take a genius decipher the more advanced parts.%%%%You will receive more papers in every world you enter and all papers start well organized and conveniently bound by subjects and references. Can be used as a nifty reference guy to know who the major contributors to science and magitech are within a world.%%%%Comes with a free office workspace pocket dimension/ warehouse attachment you can access through almost any door to store, manage, research, and work.,,
Dreamer - Echigoya Firm,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You seem to have built yourself up a nice Little, hmm.. sorry about that I mean TINY, ... you know what, screw it. You have a company; a very big company, I mean it, this thing could rival the East India Company at the peak of its power without hardly trying, it will have offices in every major and middling city and in many of the smaller towns too with outposts dotted around to grant it influence pretty much everywhere, it will have the means of production, transportation, storage, and security to rival most countries and can easily do all this following whatever economic and ethics policies you have in place.%%%%The wealth of this company is so great as to be able to influence governments in mass while handling its own mint and treasury if needed and no one will complain about this. All taxes for the company are simply taken care of and it wont come under any particular legal scrutiny or malpractice question unless you expressly order to violate the law, it also won't violate local laws unless explicitly ordered to do so.%%%%The company and its employees are quite capable of learning to manufacture almost anything if provided the means and they are all very loyal to you and the vision you lay out. It easily maintains about 75,000 direct employees who act as followers, the company is quite efficient with the number of employees it has and is well organized. You will receive 300,000,000 1oz gold coins a year along with a hefty amount of supplies and resources for personal use such as Mythril, Orichalcum, Hihiirokane, different types of lumber and wood, magical plants, animals, animal parts, monster parts ect.%%%%The company maintains itself and has even more resources available to be used for R&D or mass production.%%%%You may import this company into any future jump, it adjusts itself to the setting and you may choose to receive resources and money from this setting, the new setting, or a mix of both.,,
Reincarnator - Papers Please,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This world kinda sucks with the whole slavery, taxes, and trade papers thing. So here are a collection of papers, or small stone idols, or whatever is needed and used in each world. These are always on hand and can't really be stolen or destroyed. They are 100% real and trying to claim them as fake would get people laughed at for clearly making false claims. They cover a bunch of areas but are not limited to things such as travel papers, visas, boarding passes, self identification, family identifications, proof of taxes, and receipts, titles, deeds, possession, authority, education, occupation, qualifications, and so forth. While these can not exactly be used to forge your identity, they will cover all your taxes, fees, and bonds needed to keep up with such identifications and keep you out of jail or slavery.%%%%Proofs of qualifications can cover anything which you would be skilled enough to perform, but proofs of education would require an actual degree to back you, these documents will update to be setting appropriate and if someone tries to locate master copies or backups, everything will be correct, legitimate, and consistent whenever search or located.,,
Reincarnator - Wardrobe,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have a fairly large wooden wardrobe of your design, within this wardrobe is an infinite supply of fairly mundane clothes. Any make, model, and design in whatever colors, materials, and styles you like are available for anything that could be considered a clothing or fashion accessory like shoes, hats, or jewelry. The quality of these clothes is top tier and they are very robust and durable.%%%%Simply wearing these clothes will boost a person's appearance by 2 on a scale of 10.%%%%The clothes come with all the added properties of the Basic Gear clothing: self repairing, self cleaning, and very comfy in all climate conditions and can grant those properties to anything else placed inside.%%%%In the back is an emergency escape portal that can take those you select to one of your properties.,,
Reincarnator - The City of Today, I mean Tomorrow... Yesterday?,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This is a mega city of around the size of Tokyo, so 7000 Km^2, it has all of the amenities and technological capabilities of a modern city circa 2013 and then fully upgraded with magic to achieve things like zero waste production nuclear power, mana reactors and engines, faster than light telecommunications, infinite storage capacity hard drives, and flying and floating cars and boats and so much more. Absolutely no expense was spared in the construction of this city with maglevs, solar panels, power plants, electricity, subways, skyrails, parks, vertical indoor farms, even large hadron colliders, water treatment, processing, and storage facilities, energy efficient lighting, and even comes with things like a world wide satellite network, an international space station, full space programs and facilities, medical research facilities, hospitals, cellular technology, computers and so much more.%%%%The city is completely autonomous, self-sustaining, and repairing. It has automata of all designed for cleaning, police, and even military engagement and resources to support a population well in excess of 20 million indefinitely.%%%%This city can be imported into any jump as desired and redesigned as needed to fit the land or aesthetics as or may also function as a warehouse attachment. This city is beyond outside detection, has whatever aesthetics you desire, and will not attract the attention of Outsiders. Additionally, the city completely restricts the power and influence of Gods, spirits, and divine beings near or within it and they weaken as desired the closer they get.%%%%All the aspects of this city can be imported into any other properties that you own. Every aspect of this city and its tech is under your control and the amount of system control you share with others is up to you.,,
Reincarnator - To Infinity and Beyond,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,An infinite supply of Travel Gates is what you have here. While standardly they take on the size and shape of three large stone torii in a row, feel free to redesign yours whenever you want to selectively appear as anything you desire, made of any material you have access to, and size, so yes you could have snazzy golden stargates if you want. These gates form a network allowing for instantaneous travel across any distance or even dimensions and restrictions and methods can be put in places for others to use these gates. No one and nothing can enter or use these gates against your will.%%%%Whenever you need a new gate to place somewhere, just reach into a currently existing gate and pull out the pieces of or the entirety of a new gate. An indestructible master gate will be added to your warehouse or as an attachment, if you don't have a cosmic warehouse of some sort, you do now with a shape of 200ft by 200ft by 200ft. If you do have a cosmic warehouse of some sort its size is at least doubled in size to accommodate. The Master Gate can occupy up to the size of one wall and represents the largest gate possible.%%%%The gates can be self charged and detonated with a magical explosion equivalent to a 100 MT nuclear detonation. The self charge feature can also be used as a means of supply for magical energy. Any powers and items of transportation, teleportations, conjurations, portals, or other can be fully integrated with this item.%%%%Whenever you enter a jump, you may have gates automatically inserted into the setting at choice locations, even in other local dimensions or planets. The number of gates that can be automatically inserted is equal to 2 times the number of jumps you've entered.%%%%Any area within about 200ft of these gates is considered your property for the purposes of other perks or items and powers. Post-Chain or Spark all individual aspects of this item are increased by at least an order of magnitude.,,
Summoned Hero - Advanced Gear,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You get some advanced gear like a suit of armor or a coat with some nice enchantments. You also get a weapon of your choice. The options are a Staff (better magic), a melee weapon, like a sword or an axe(pretty self explanatory, I think) or a magical gun (shoots, but with magic instead of combustion).%%%%The gear is self repairing and self cleaning as well as really comfy and the weapon is of exceptional quality so that it will always stay functional and is really, really hard to break.%%%%Should you manage to break it anyway, a new one will appear in your warehouse or other property as needed a few hours later. If you already possess similar gear it can be imported to gain this one's qualities.,,
Summoned Hero - Mount of Champions,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Unlike the pet option, this can be basically any animal up to and including a wyvern, a powerful and intelligent magical creature somewhere between a demon and a true dragon, specifically trained for and [skilled] in personal and mounted combat, maneuverability options, and tactics, while also have powerful abilities like dragon magic and fire breathing. Feel free to design them however you like. They will be at half your level. He loves you with all his heart and always will.,,
Summoned Hero - Adventure Party,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Sometimes a hero needs a team. So here is a team. Four followers who fill in the roles of a fantasy party to help the [Hero] out on their adventure. Like almost everything else, feel free to design them however you like. They can be human or demi-human at your discretion, but function as if they have the demi-human origin in terms of capabilities, they each also get a different title, job, and class, and 4 additional skills and sub-skills to start with. They will always be at half your level but may pick up new skills or titles on their own. You may assign their skill and stat points for them. They each come with their own level appropriate gear at the star and mount (They remain followers, and can be brought into future jumps, but can not be imported, all of this is the item),,
Summoned Hero - {Godreaper},,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,There was a blade being built that was never completely finished, the perfect weapon. A paradox in the form of a scythe, for the Godreaper could only become a god reaper by reaping a god. The original was unfinished, but still the most powerful weapon ever created, though not its final form. This is the perfect unachieved version.%%%%This is a melee weapon of your choice, in any style or design you like. This weapon is perfectly balanced in your hands. It can cut through anything you desire as if it wasn't there: the physical, the immaterial, the intangible, mental, spiritual, and even magical. It is completely indestructible, unerasable, and immutable by others while in your possession. It is formed from the finest materials ever conceived, forged by the hands of the greatest craftsman to ever exist, infused with thousands of years of pure divinity across many faiths, and tempered into a god. Yes, this blade is a God in and of itself.%%%%It will instantly kill anything, at every conceivable level, that it gets a hit on and absolutely nothing can block it, it can even strike beings that try to teleport past it. It will drain any divinity from what it strikes storing it for use by its wielder.,,
Local - Craft Services,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,With all the food around here it’s hard not to get hungry. You get a self-refilling table piled with any and every food and drink that appears in the series, the food never goes bad and the table provides the perfect picnic environment clearing away unwanted pests. Comes with all the chairs, utensils, and tableware you need for such a grand feast.,,
Local - Witches Cauldron,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A large witches cauldron containing an infinite supply of any potion, elixir, concoction, medicine, stew, soup, sauce, or liquid, ect, crafted or poured into it, preserved and kept at the perfect temperature. The cauldron will clean and clear itself out with a simple command making it a pretty nifty trash disposal and can refill itself with any prior substance. Comes with an elixir made with almost impossibly pure and rare materials that can cure any injury or disease as long as the receiver is still alive and powerful enough to even repair fractured souls and psychies, makes for a great tasting energy drink. (What's it taste like? whatever you want, or even the thing that would taste best to the drinker, or worst if you don't like someone you need to heal) Also comes with an infinite supply of clay jars and vials of nearly any make and size to preserve whatever you need to put inside.,,
Local - Gunship,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A flying air and spaceship of your design built to fight gods and space kaiju. Comes with a 20m railgun and every type of ammo imaginable, magical and otherwise. Also has the ability to travel via sub-space, whether it can reach other dimensions is unknown. While basically functioning as a flying automated fortress of doom, it is self repairing, you don't need to worry about fuel or power sources and has infinite ammo of every conceivable kind.%%%%If lost, stolen, or destroyed, a replacement will arrive within 24 hours. Comes with snazzy telepathic control key staff.,,
Local - Kingdom Hearts,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You are now the owner of a Kingdom and City Core, a floating 20-sided shining blue crystal. Your kingdom contains a population of about 1,000,000 followers across an area basically the size of... you know, for as many maps as we get to see in the anime, there's a lot I would give for one well labeled correctly scaled map in this series... pick any sized country between Denmark and France. You gain a kingdom of that size of your specifications, with amazingly fertile land and natural resources, good climate, a collection of major cities and smaller towns and outposts, and well developed infrastructure.%%%%Your city core can create smaller, weaker copies of itself for you to give to other nobles to help run your territories and it has in fact already done so for all the major cities in your territories or that you otherwise already own. The smaller created cores can make even smaller cores as needed with appropriately fractional power, but each core grows in power depending on the size and population of its cities and overall kingdom. Right now with just this item, the master City Core provides you with power on par with a level 60 Demi-human magic focused [Hero] and within your territories, a substantial boost, but it also functions as a massive well of magical power.%%%%The City Core draws abundant magical power from The Source, and exists for the purpose of letting the person who becomes its master to make use of that vast magic power. The entire network of City Cores builds a magical network that can be used to transfer information and redistribute large amounts of magic and power over a vast area. The entire administration method of this network is up to you and it's completely loyal to you, while the network doesn't have a personality per say, it does have a kind of will of its own prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of you its administrator, itself, then its current overseer, the city it is integrated with and its people. An administrator could establish their City Core to allow citizens to freely use it's ritual magic or restrict it as much as needed.%%%%Truly various and strange magics are available through the core; it could create walls that could defend against attack from high-ranking demons, restructure the entire city and function as its avatar, attack magic that can reduce armies to ashes, climate magic that could manipulate weather, or so much more.%%%%You may import your kingdom and or city core however you wish into any jump or as an attachment to your warehouse and space will be made for it.,,
Import A Companion,,3,,-500,,False,,False,,Bring into this jump 1 companion. They will receive 600cp for purchases they would like to make, but they can not take drawbacks.,,
Import Entourage,,3,,-2500,,False,,False,,Bring into this jump 8 companions. They will each receive 600cp for purchases they would like to make, but they can not take drawbacks.,,
Takeout,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Incompatable with Dragon God%%%%Choose a character in setting and fate will guarantee you meet this person on at the best possible terms, providing you the opportunity to become friends or more. You may ask this person to join you in your chain and if they agree they will become a companion. Alternatively, you may preemptively purchase this and ask someone you just happen to meet in this chain to join you, but if they refuse this purchase is wasted. You will have till the end of the jump to get them to say yes, but no coercion.,,
Dragon God,,3,,-5000,,False,,True,,Dragon God is your best friend. Why? Because she says so, that's why. She is a multiversal deity and the most powerful being seen in this setting, but she does have a lot of limits. She will join you into your chain if you purchase this. The only things that you can do that will bother her are as follows: doubt your friendship, try to leave her behind, sexualize her in any way (you are the best of best friends, nothing more, absolutely nothing less), and become a lolicon. The first two will just result in pep talks, pestering, jabbing, ribbing, and other such things. The third will probably result in getting severely admonished or beaten up and the last might just get you killed.%%%%Other than that she probably understands you better than you understand yourself and will accept you no-matter what and wants you to do whatever you want. She will "import" herself into any jump even if you don't pay the cp to bring her in, but she won't gain any power from that jump, if even that is impossible she will still show up as an illusion providing encouragement and affirmation or just a good old talk when you need it. This does not mean she will solve all your problems, hack she might not even solve any of your problems, because she wants to encourage you to be able to do things on your own.,,
Is This... A Different Version?,,4,,00,,False,,False,,This is a toggle, for people who would like to choose between the manga, the anime, web novel and the light novel. Otherwise, you will be in a world blended with elements from all sources.,,
Disadvantage,,4,,500,,False,,False,,Choose one stat that you do not have an Unfair Advantage in. For the remainder of this jump that stat is reduced by 25%. This may be purchased multiple times for different stats and or double up for a 50% disadvantage.,,
I'm not a Loli,,4,,500,,False,,False,,You look like a child to everyone and absolutely no one will take you seriously as they would an adult, this might actually let you get away with stuff that kids could get away with here. But remember, this is a world where people are totally cool with selling a child into slavery because he forgot his town pass on raid night.%%%%For an additional 100 you will constantly be grabbing the attention of creepy perverts of a less desirable persuasion, some of whom will actively try to kidnap you or bribe officials into having you enslaved, or outright ruining your life just to get their hands on to you.%%%%For an additional 150 you're pretty much a kid, all the hell of highschool puberty all over again, awkward motor skills, voice changes, the works, no matter what form you take. (Flying as a dragons gonna be ruff) failing your drivers test (how do you fail to pass a driving test for a horse and buggy, no one knows but your gonna do it several times), complete inability to hold your liquor let alone procuring it and god help you if you try to smoke a hooka, rampant moods swings out the wazoo. You have all the grace of a chicken with its head cut off and all stats are reduced by 30% and the other aspects of this just get worse.,,
I’m Not A Lolicon,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,All of your charms are redirected to people you aren’t interested in. Like mature women? Now you attract lolis like a cake attracts wasps. The default is lolis/shotas but if you are after these (and I know some / a lot of you are) this turns into the opposite of your prefered partner.%%%%For an additional 200 cp, almost everybody is going to take this the wrong way and think you are the pervert. It will take serious time to convince people otherwise and in the meantime you might end up with an entire village chasing you out of town for something you didn't even do. Noble knights, soldiers, and officers of the law may take serious issue with you or even decide to take justice into their own hands.%%%%For another 300 cp, this just got so so much worse. You are another best friend of the Dragon God. Wait, how is that bad you might say? Well let me let you in on the real plot of the Story, The Dragon God is a multiversal entity that is best friends with every single version of Satou across the multiverse, but one version of him committed an unspeakable crime so she took all the other versions of him from across the multiverse to combined them together to make our Protag and send him to kill the vile and villainous version of himself because she could not bare to do it herself. What was his great crime you may ask, why he was lolicon! (Seriously she didn't care one blip about the mass murder, betrayal of the elves, or the system of suffering, he became a lolicon so he must die) She hasn't quite resorted to doing the same for you, but she probably will before your time here is up unless you can convence her you arent one, and frankly shes not in the mood to see you right now pervert.,,
TOO MUCH POWER!,,4,,1500,,False,,False,,Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and that statement has so much more meaning in this world than most can realize. None of your spiritual, mental, or soul protections work against this setting's innate powers. Miasma in high enough concentrations can corrupt or kill you if your soul vessel is found wanting, and be warned that gaining unique skills outside of CP purchase invites whispering into your mind and an inability to fight against the god whose fragments you have embedded. Using these powers will increase their volume and once you can no longer hear yourself think and the pain from the cacophony in your soul is too great, you will collapse and you will for all purposes be dead. Not using a power for a long time will slowly cause its whispering to reduce to the point of absolute silence. Your willpower is all you have to fight the voices off.%%%%For an additional 150 (300 total), even the unique skills purchased with cp here will be from other gods of your choice. Having unique skills from various gods might slow down the ultimate collapse of your being as the fragments fight for control but the conflicting voices may drive you to madness and rage quicker. Any powers you have bolstering your willpower are removed making you far more vulnerable to the voices.%%%%For another 150 (450 total), every single power, perk , and ability you posses has a whisper in your mind, begging to be used, pushing you to act in a way that it desires, the strength of the voice determined by the strength of the ability getting louder far faster when used one ups when used provide particularly malicious suicidal thoughts.,,
Resource Deprivation,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It seems that the legacy of one of the precursor civilisations here now affects you. You find that the material resources needed for crafting any sort of advanced technology are not only scarce, but nearly nonexistent. The gods of this world are also watching in case anyone becomes too technologically advanced for comfort, and using anything that is fairly obviously advanced technology will provoke their intervention.,,
Not So Shiny Toys,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Mandatory for no points during All Gods Must Die scenario%%%%All none imported items, followers, and pets (Except an empty warehouse) are barred from jump.,,
Level Drain,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Mandatory for no points during All Gods Must Die scenario%%%%I sure hope you haven’t become too complacent in your powers Jumper. By taking this drawback you lose access to all out of jump powers, abilities, and perks (Except your body mod). Here’s hoping skill beats out power for you.,,
Complete Zero: (0),,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Oh did I say you got to keep your memories of the outside world. Silly me, you now know nothing about this world or jumpchain in general beyond a vague notion of what you're supposed to be doing here and the goals of the scenarios you choose for yourself which will be recorded into your system for recall, your memories of other jumps are wiped clean, it is as if you wake up in this world after going to sleep the night before jumpchain started for you. Not too bad, right? Unfortunately for you, you can no longer be a complete-drop in, you had a life here that "you" can no longer remember, people just won’t stop recognising you and it seems you constantly meet people who act as if you’ve known each other forever. If this wasn’t bad enough not all of them are guaranteed to be friendly.,,
The Three Great Demon Lords,,4,,5000,,False,,False,,It appears that your existence has been noted by the Golden Wild Boar King, Goblin Demon Lord, and the Dog-Head Ancient King. Realizing the threat you might pose, but poses no insight into what you can specifically do, they have formed an alliance with each other and numerous other Demon Lords to take you down. These three Demon Lords have all exceeded the 100 Level cap and the Dog-Head will be at the power he was when he fought Satou.. All of these Demon Lords have somehow become mentally stable again as a result of your entrance, now using their powers in a more intelligent manner. Should you prevent one or more of these Demon Lords from reforming, a different Demon Lord with similar capabilities will take their place.,,
Head of State,,4,,7000,,False,,False,,When Satou fought the Dog-Head Ancient King, the King was nowhere near the power he was in ancient times. But now, the King is back, baby! The Dog-Head Ancient King will be just as powerful as he was the day he was slain by the pillar gods, the day he decided to overthrow the Demon God and the supposed god at to run to the others for help. Beware Jump, this is a being that took the combined might of all eight of the human gods in ancient times to kill. Though it's doubtful he would succeed against even one and definitely not two today. This being has taken an interest in you, if you prove a worthy jumper he will want to eat you all the more. He will study you, your tactics, and become aware of any ability you use in this setting and plan accordingly. He won't confront you for at least six month but you never know when he will strike. You can always seek him out to destroy him early if you want, but this is a being who could hide from and assassinate lesser gods in mass. If taken with The Three Great Demon Lords the King from that drawback will be a new demon lord and all four will work together.,,
Gojira!,,5,,00,,False,,True,,All of your out of setting powers, abilities, perks, and items are unavailable. All other scenario rewards are unavailable. You still have access to your body mod and an empty warehouse. This scenario can be taken as part of your main jump or as a separate before or after scenario jump, choosing to take on this scenario and failing all goals is a jump and chain failure.%%%%Oh, sorry wrong setting, but eh, close enough. You are a kaiju. What kind of kaiju are you? Well for now you’re a space jellyfish class or so called [Evil Fish] kaiju. You look like a giant jellyfish or man o'war of your design, but when I say giant, I mean it. An average jelly’s main body is over 100 meters long and its tentacle feelers make it three times longer than that. It can float, levitate, and fly at incredible speeds and not only survive but thrive through deep space travel. It has and utilizes dangerous venoms that allow it to manipulate and parasitize organisms without being rejected and even converting, subverting, and controlling the hosts systems for its own desires and defense or can be used to corrode and consume matter and magic alike. The jelly’s can feed on magical, electrical, and ethereal energy directly to enhance their natural biological functions, heal, grow, or reproduce as needed, it does not appear as if they actually need to eat though. They can reproduce very quickly, and if they or their environment is threatened they can rapidly drain energy to explosively reproduce and achieve a population of about 10,000 immature jellies in a few days. They are incredibly resistant to magic, cold, darkness, paralysis, and sleep both in a physical and metaphysical sense. They have incredible supernatural senses that allow them to detect and ready attacks from sources tens of kilometers away and can detect concentrations of magic and technology across star systems. They are able to generate electricity and fire it out from their feelers in a 3 kilometer range , form shields and barriers out of this energy which can further drain and absorb the energy from incoming attacks, and drain magic from hosts and other nearby sources to further push their abilities. Their draining abilities can instantly disrupt and consume magical and electrical systems making golems and technology extremely vulnerable, they generate a fairly large null mana and magic zones preventing the casting of other being’s spells within the zone and weakening the effects of spells directed at them, the strongest barriers and wards whether magic or otherwise created by mortals can only contain them for a week or two before withering away or being consumed.%%%%While Satou describes them as fragile, that is only in comparison to the fact that using arrows designed to stun incredibly powerful true demon lords, they received significant injuries. In truth the average one ranges in power between a level 20 and 40 dragon with defenses far out pacing their power and a regeneration that can completely restore their bodies within a few days or faster if they have energy to consume. It is said they are weak to fire, heat, and similar concepts, but in actuality, it would be more accurate to say they simply aren’t as resistant to those things. You will be an above average Jelly comparable to a level 50 dragon whose main body pushes past 150 meters and 500 meter tentacles, your size and abilities growing directly with our comparative level. While you are classified within the system it is very clear you are not part of it and the unique abilities of your race, [mysterious creature] or [bizarre monster], are codified into an impossible skill called [Absorption]. As all they other outsiders are noted to be even more resistance to the magic of the gods, even if other jellies are not, your magical resistances will only expand and grow the more godly the type of magic used against you is, though this growth in resistance is often outpaced by the strength of the beings who wield such magics, it will definitely be enough to disturb or scare them.%%%%For this scenario you will have several possible goals and rewards based on what you accomplish, none of which are mutually exclusive, but because of what happens when the barrier comes down you’ll probably lose the opportunity to eat the trees after the the gods die. You are entering this world about 25,000 years before the start of the main plot. About 5,000 years before this the demon god got his butt kicked by the outsiders and began his plans to increase his power, there are still a lot of gods around here that aren’t the 8 main human gods and Parion and the Demon God are nowhere near as strong as they will be in 25,000 years but the other main human gods are a only slightly weaker than they will be in the future and all the gods are on alert to the threat the outsiders pose. But, no one is explicitly aware of what you are or that you're even here yet. You only need to achieve one to not fail.%%%%%%First Reward – Survive: All you have to do is survive 10 years as this kaiju. If you do that, you will get to keep this form as an alt-form and all the benefits that entails. This scenario ends after 10 years.%%%%Second Reward – Eat: There are at least eight main world trees throughout this world, humongous partially physical and partially ethereal trees that supply most of the mana for this world. You and your fellow jellies must consume them. For each one consumed your relative level will be increased by 10 and for every four consumed you will get a bonus 10 levels. Also for every tree consumed you will gain 10,000 jellies and they will gain 5 levels as followers and summons to take with you into future worlds, and for every four trees consumed you will gain a bonus 10,000 jellies and all of them will gain an additional 5 levels. Be warned the elves will quickly take action to stop the jellies from consuming the world trees to the point that the most war like elves destroyed their tree and turned their lands into a desert to kill the jellies attacking theirs, and until a jelly actually parasitizes a tree the tree will also try to defend itself from the jellies but after enough jellies latch on the trees defenses can be turned on others.%%%%Third Reward – Kill: The eight main human gods of this world that maintain the pillars keeping the other outsiders away must die, well at least six of them. You don’t have to permanently end them and in fact you don’t personally have to kill them at all. But all the gods must be dead at the same time, meaning that they cannot be able to manifest an avatar or help maintain the pillars. When gods die, as long as they have enough worshippers or divinity and their power is not usurped, they can come back slowly given a thousand years or so, so this is primarily not an issue for this scenario but it may come up. However, other gods can heal or pool their energies together to quickly bring back other gods which absolutely may pose an issue. There may be alternative ways to bring down the pillars or usher in the end of the world by the others, and any of those will be accepted also. If you have the power to take god fragments or usurp divinity or are somehow divine yourself, killing one of the eight major gods personally will grant you a fragment of their power as a unique skill of your choice thematic to the god you killed. As a reward for bringing down the pillars and the gods being swept aside, you will gain a new kaiju alt-form of your design, anything you want, ranging in size between a black rigid diamond like dodecahedron the size of a house cat all the way up to a mountain ranged sized eldritch amorphous cuttlefish with all the colors of the rainbow. Your form is yours to choose as there appears to be more outsider types than you can shake a stick at, though most seem to be sea life or geometric shapes of some kind and somewhere on the greyscale.%%%%While your power will be a good bit lower than the Demon Kings, your defenses outstrip everything short of the highest tier outsiders, a god killing spell munition weapon fired from the most powerful platforms and casters ever created, specifically designed to fight you, might result in a lost limb at most which you can regenerate from. You have a large field around you that absorbs mana and energy completely preventing the casting of magic and greatly reducing the effects of spells if not completely dissipating them before they ever reach your incredibly magic resistant body. Your durability is greater than any natural material or mundane alloy at its base. Magical wards, barriers, seals, curses, blessing, magitech, technology, mystical effects, and so much more collapse, break, and fall apart around you at will ready to have their energies consumed as if you were a harbinger of entropy itself. Your divine resistances keep up with the growth in power of such beings such that if you were in the same tier of power or level as an enemy god their magic wouldn’t even scratch you. You will have out right immunity to cold, darkness, sleep, stunning, plus an additional element and status effect of your choice that isn’t light or heat related. It takes fires or heat reaching into the hundreds of thousands of degrees for you to really notice and tens of millions to severely harm you and you now have a core within you about 1/100th your overall size that is far more durable than the rest of you and as long as that core remains intact you can regenerate completely in a few minutes. Your senses are vast, able to detect large concentrations of magic and technology across galaxies and travel between the stars near the speed of light, and in close proximity your fine senses detect hundreds of kilometers. Additionally, in place of the poison and electrical abilities of the jellies you will gain a new set of three abilities of your design that can be far stronger or versatile. Like the jelly all of your abilities such as the defenses beyond your comparable level, regeneration, anti-magic, and so forth are wrapped up into a singular impossible unique skill for this form to use.,,
Return Gojira!,,5,,00,,False,,True,,This scenario can be taken as part of your main jump or as a separate before or after scenario jump, choosing to take on this scenario and failing all goals is a jump and chain failure.%%%%In this scenario you will be given the body of one of the black octopus class outsiders, a moon sized black eldritch octopus of doom, your destructive power surpasses that of the Demon Kings but falls short of even the apostles, your defenses are absolutely unreal compared to almost everything else in this setting to the point that three simultaneous god killing spell munition weapons launched by actual full gods might leave you with some scratches, a bruise, or at worst a cracked bone, and your senses to track magic and technology is on a universal scale while your direct senses span out thousands upon thousands of miles. It would take fires approaching a hundred million degrees to start hurting you. Not only may you move through the stars near the speed of light, but even in close range you approach those speeds in reaction, agility, and movement. You can freely move between local dimensions and concurrent timelines. Your magic and divine destabilization is colossal and could shut down half of everyone else’s magic on earth, including weaker gods if you got close enough. You have a core and can completely regenerate your mass in a few seconds as long as it remains and a single one of your tentacles could smash through the moon. Beyond that, you don’t seem to display any unique capabilities like some of the other outsiders, but your mana, ether, and energy absorption and efficiency is significantly better than the rest. How such a massive form could even be maintained is beyond all reason, but hey, you seem to be doing fine.%%%%You will start your journey at the same time as Satou in this new world. The only difference is that you will be out in the void unable to come near this world until such a time as the pillars collapse and the barrier protecting the world comes down, allowing all of the outsiders to start invading. You cannot break or bypass the barrier in anyway and from that point you have 24 horse till the scenario ends. Like the previous scenario there are several goals that can be achieved. You only need to achieve one to not fail.%%%%First – Destroya of worlds: You must succeed where the army of outsiders originally failed. The planet must be destroyed. For accomplishing this you may keep this form granted to you by the scenario, while having a much shorter description, it is still well beyond the power and scope of the previous custom kaiju alt-form. Any immunities you had in a previously mentioned kaiju form from this jump are upgraded to an absorption for this form and you may gain one additional elemental and status absorption not related to light or fire or heat. Additionally, any powers and abilities of the kaiju or eldritch monstrosity forms you take are expanded in all capacities by more than double.%%%%First – Destroya of worlds: You must succeed where the army of outsiders originally failed.

All Gods Must Die,,5,,00,,False,,False,,All of your out of setting powers, abilities, perks, and items are unavailable. All other scenario rewards are unavailable. You still have access to your body mod and an empty warehouse. Your system level will be set to (0/1). This scenario is taken as part of your main jump, choosing to take on this scenario and failing both goals is a jump and chain failure.%%%%First – Deicide: You must kill three gods or composited gods who’s power is equivalent to three gods (Parion after slaying and incompletely absorbing 5 other gods would count as 2 gods for a composite). The Gods must die by your direct actions and hand. A fragment, avatar, or other such instance will not count. Originally, at the start of the series only three known gods were fully within the world: The Dragon God, The Demon God, and Parion. Over the course of the story, Zaikuon will be resurrected, from being killed 30 years prior, and proceed to descend to the mortal realm. The other gods will eventual come forth overtime. If you have the ability to, you could enter the godly realms to kill them, but gods are far far more powerful within their divine havens and in spiritual realms; there is also the option that there may be other gods lurking around somewhere but nothing conclusive as the other gods seem to have been wiped out or left this realm entirely. Killing gods grants massive amounts of experience and the god slayer titles, the generic god slayer title certifies you as a god slayer, but each time you kill a god you will also gain a specific title such as [God Slayer: Parion] which is more specific, permits you to learn and to use their holy magics without their consent as long as the title is equipped, though provides no innate skill to do so, and makes you stronger against similar gods to the point of being nearly undefeatable by the same god if resurrected even if they doubled their power, people will also understand that you are a slayer of the gods concept like a slayer of love or demons and are stronger against their very elements. While killing gods and usurping their power might be the fastest way for an individual to amass personal power, there is a great deal of power lost in the transfer and a net loss in the system overall. Killing a god does not guarantee the acquisition of a workable unique skill fragment.%%%%By killing three gods you have ascended to godhood yourself, on par with the pillar gods, gaining slightly expanded versions of all the godhood benefits mentioned earlier in the jump. If you happened to already be a god you will transcend the power of the mortal gods and sit somewhere between them and Parion after she absorbed the others. You will gain two full authorities, one of your choice, and one know as [Administrator], which massively expands all of your other divine powers, strengthens them, and removes their weaknesses. You will also gain the skill [Slay God] which can instantly destroy significantly lesser deities or any god’s avatar. You may continue to kill gods in future worlds to amass more and more divine power but it took Parion exponentially more to raise her power, as such it will take you exponentially more. Killing 5 gods will raise your divine power by 100%, then 25 more to raise it another 100% then 125, then 625 more to raise it another 100%. Just like Satou said in the beginning “why would I want to do that.”%%%%Second – Friendship: The high elves got a raw deal in their arrangement with the Pillar Gods and when Parion and The Demon god functionally betrayed them, the other gods refused to get involved and support the elves. This shall not stand. To succeed at this reward, you must become a trusted and beloved ally of at least one of the elven clans symbolized by either gaining an honored name, mark of friendship, or even marriage into a clan (this is a harem manga, did you think we forgot). Second, you must renegotiate the deal the elves had with the gods and guarantee they enforce it for at least 100 years. There are multiple ways to achieve this and you don’t necessarily need all the gods active cooperation, or heck any of the current gods cooperation, but it is better. For achieving this goal, you shall be granted your own collection of eight world trees to be added to your warehouse or in the new colossal magical forest attachment that’s been added to your warehouse and can place into any world you visit and or continue to grow more at your leisure, though they will take thousands upon thousands of years to grow to the size and power of the currently established ones. Also you will gain all eight of the clans as devoted followers to travel with you to future world, while only one of the clans is particularly aggressive, all of them can produce capable warriors and they are quit talented at defending large territories from insurmountable forces. You will also be blessed like these elven royals, gaining a supernatural connection with nature able to sense things on the wind, communicate with trees and animals and through the web of life communicate others at long distances, along with an ability to manipulate the natural flow of mana through the world and call upon the world for aid, you are blessed by nature itself who wishes for your safety and joy.%%%%Any of the powers, abilities, skills, or items (must be on your person, in your warehouse, or in your inventory) you acquire in this setting will continue with you, fiat backed and being replaced if broken, lost or stolen within 10 years or 1 jump whichever comes first. Any levels purchased will be added to you after your jump.,,
