Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Location,,0,,500,,False,,False,,Niflheim, Primordial Realm of Darkness, Cold, Mist, and Ice. Within this realm lie the frozen rivers of Élivágar and the well of Hvergelmir, from which all the rivers run. Niflheim was the second realm to come into being after Muspelheim.%%%%Muspelheim, Primordial Realm of Fire. Home of the Fire Giants. This world is ruled by Surtr and it was the first realm to come into being from the void, with the following seven being made by the gods.%%%%Asgard, Realm of the Aesir. The realm of order and civilization that would come to be ruled by the god ?Óðinn. Asgard is the realm of the Aesir gods and it is a place that exists within the boundaries of law and custom. This realm exists at the top of Yggdrasil and it is connected to Midgard by the rainbow bridge Bifrost. Here lies Valhalla.%%%%Álfheimr, Realm of the Bright Elves. A gracious realm of light and beauty. This realm is ruled by the Vanir god Freyr.%%%%Midgard, Realm of Men. Forged from the corpse of Ymir, located in the middle of the World Tree, it is surrounded by a great ocean and all the other realms. This is the home of mortals. While it was fenced off from the other wilder, more dangerous realms by the gods there are places where the realms intersect and so it is still possible for things to find their way in, or out.%%%%Niðavellir, Realm of the Dwarves. Upon dark fields a dwelling stands forged by halls of red gold and within rests the ?dvergar hold? Sindri the ?Myrkheim, shelter of valorous dead. In these halls shall dwell good men and pure in heart.%%%%Svartalfheim, Realm of the Black Elves. A labyrinthine, subterranean complex of tunnels, caves, and mines.%%%%Jötunheimr, also known as Utgard, Realm of the Giants. The realm of wilderness beyond the boundaries of order and civilization. Jotunheim is the land of the Jötnar, the so called Giants; it is a chaotic place full of anarchy and chaos of untamed nature. This realm can be said to 'surround' Midgard so a lucky explorer may eventually find his way there from here.%%%%Vanaheimr, Realm of the Vanir. This is a fertile land full of life located ‘west’ of Asgard through Yggdrasil. Many practitioners of magic, and even Seiðr, make their home here. Step lightly.%%%%Free Choice - You may choose anywhere in the realms of Yggdrasil or even some place like Ginnungagap, the primordial void, if you want to be bored for a while.,,
Backgrounds and History,,0,,00,,False,,False,,People come from all walks of life. What’s your story? Any of these backgrounds can be taken as a drop in, with no history or memories. You may begin at any time.,,
Warrior,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Whether a hero of legend, a soldier of war or fortune, alone or in a vast army, or a veteran of strife, you shall be the rock that does not wither upon the shore. As a romantic idealist, the warrior poet stands alone and unblinkingly dares to do what others declare impossible. You are a skilled fighter and able gladiator prepared to face these worlds head on, trained not just on land but at sea and sail.,,
Trickster,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Politicians and entertainers alike. You have talents, not necessarily in fighting, though you will not find yourself particularly wanting there either, but in deceit, skill with hidden attacks against body and social standing alike. Sleight of hand and legalese are second nature to you and you can easily skirt about social circles from high society to the dregs of society.,,
Healer,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You have a noble spirit and a gift to mend and protect those you care for and the world itself. Trained not only in medicine and spiritual counselling to heal the hearts of man, but in agriculture and defensive fighting to guarantee its very survival.,,
Teacher,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Hamingja Required%%%%You may be or have been a traveler, wandering the lands learning all you can, discerning the different cultures of the world, trying to find a better way. You have trained to survive in lands far more foreign than simple far off shores and held tight to your skills. You know how to train others in these ways and have gained a profound sense of patience and inner calm to learn, analyse, and deal with the troubles of the world.,,
Monster,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Angrboða Required%%%%You are you. While this statement holds true for every being, this statement holds more weight in reference to you. Maybe you were a blacksmith turned into a dragon or a child born of hatred, either way no matter where you go or where you came from, you are an inevitability, written and spoken about long in advance of your arrival.%%%%People will be awed and in fear of you before you even make your presence known and once you do they will not be underwhelmed by the reality of you. Their minds coming up with something more monstrous or more imposing than you could ever fulfill? No! You are beyond anything as simple as a giant wolf; you are that which puts fear into gods and delivers upon that promise.%%%%People are not awed or in fear of you like they are of a villain or an enemy, you are the unconquerable given form, like an ideal or natural disaster given shape. Your nature and their hopes and fears determining how people anticipate your arrival.%%%%People have an impossible time trying to shunt you into categorical descriptions, someone might say you're titanic, beautiful, and or terrifying but they understand and feel the language can never do your reality justice.%%%%You may choose to be another child of Loki or not, but no matter your choices in this jump you will at minimum have a close family that loves you even and especially as a Monster.,,
Races, Age, and Gender,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Lines Between. Races in the old mythologies are vague and even fluid at times, not so much a hard racial line but a measure of spiritual purpose and significance, more tribes than distinct connections and bodily distinction. As such, you need not make such affirmative selection; tales will fill with your deeds and the world will come to know what you are.%%%%Choose a single cosmological order to start your tale, you may choose any age that would be appropriate to your story, both in actual and appearance; you may choose to be male, female, something else, or in-between.,,
Mortal,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Most of the tales pertaining to mortals deal with humans, men and women, but some deal with the birds and the bees or sometimes even shrubs and trees. Mortals are generally not as powerful as the members of the other races but there are a lot more of them and there are always those who break the mold; there are always heroes or legends. You can choose any mundane species, you are now of its kind and, if you want, can be like Sigfriend or Sleipnir, a mortal descendant of a God, containing the barest sliver of divinity.,,
Vættir,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,Whether you are of the ?Dvergar (dwarves), Alfar (elves), Ljósálfar, Hvítálfar, Dökkálfar, or something else entirely, you are now beyond the form of mortals. The Dwarves are dark skinned, sometimes pitch black in appearance, natural smiths and craftsmen, being strong enough to hold up the sky; some scholars believe that the Dökkálfar (Dark Elves) are these people by another name. The Light Elves are said to be luminous beings that are more beautiful than the sun and possess innate powers such as to cause, cure, and heal illnesses.,,
Guðkunnigr,,0,,-4000,,False,,False,,Jötnar - meaning “devourers” - are chaotic spirits of destruction, entropy and decay, who are often the enemies of the Aesir. They come in many shapes and many sizes, though a great many assume humanoid forms, and can possess a wide variety of magical powers such as shapeshifting.%%%%The Disir on the other hand are female guardian spirits of people, or land, or they could be fertility goddesses, and have been perceived as the ranks from which the valkyries are pulled. This also covers unnamed gods of other tribes. These are the things to which you may choose to belong.,,
Ginnregin,,0,,-6000,,False,,False,,The Aesir gods and goddesses, the main tribe of deities. They live in the celestial fortress Asgard and maintain the order of the cosmos. They possess the earth shaking strength to contend with giants and an affinity for war and power. The Vanir gods and goddesses, the second main tribe of deities, tend to be more associated with the “natural world” than the Aesir. They are often strong enough to contend with the Aesir but many are bent towards more magical pursuits instead. They possess an affinity for sexual and ecological fertility.,,
Ymir,,0,,-8000,,False,,True,,Twin, a name most perplexing for a solitary being. But no longer shall he be of singular company, you are now a primordial god. Colossal in size and scope of being, you are an origin of life itself, able to freely create new flaura, fauna, and the like with ease. You could "birth" new pantheons of gods without even noticing.%%%%Your anatomy could more easily be described figuratively than literally, as you are now something beyond mortal understanding; the ways by which you interact with the world is physics defying incomprehensible by even the most esoteric and eccentric fictions in the realms of science or fantasy.%%%%Many beings would come to be primordials or personifications of concepts like fire, earth, oceans, rivers, metal, forests, stone, or life, but none of these could be without you or your twin. You are a primordial and a personification of The World.,,
Hamingja,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,Regardless of what skin they bear or race they belong, there are those who were born or forged their own way to greatness. For 200 more cp you are now counted among them. You may purchase this in addition to other racial options.%%%%Luck and power. Both in the conventional sense but also in a form of identity, the fame and power to which one holds claim, that which separates heroes and kings from commoners; it is an intrinsic aspect of one's own self.%%%%The higher you are in the cosmological order the greater your Hamingja is by virtue of birthright, but also the more rigid and unchanging. Greater beings are trapped by their Hamingja within the bonds of urd, often gaining little power if any at all by their own acts or deeds, simply changing the nature or focus of their power, while the lesser mortals with great effort and risk can grow beyond their station to put their names amongst the stars and stones.%%%%Your luck is so great as to elevate you from that of a nameless lesser deity or demigod to being counted among the lesser known Vanir, a mortal to being a hero as marvelous as Sigurd, a dwarf to being counted among the four pillars and kings, or from a powerful being of the pantheon to being on par with the likes of Baldr, Freyr, Frigg, or the All-Father himself. I can not fathom what a primordial like Ymir would become.%%%%No matter your nature however, you will retain the mortal gift of being able to grow, not simply change. Hamingja can be borrowed, split, gifted, and even traded temporarily and permanently; it can pass from dead ancestors to newborns, through either bloodline or spiritual succession.%%%%This perk can merge with your other luck perks expanding the power and luck you express through these worlds’ gifts while also removing and or allowing you to toggle their negative aspects.,,
Angrboða,,0,,-4000,,False,,True,,No matter the kind of being something is, some are simply more monstrous than others. For an added 400cp, you can be counted among the boogiemen of the gods. You may purchase this in addition to other racial options.%%%%You are now big, like actually as big as most people think the Jötnar are. As a Guðkunnigr, you could be a snake whose body encircles the world, or a wolf whose mouth reaches from bedrock to heaven and could devour the sun.%%%%You no longer obey the square cube law; in fact, you murdered it and all its relatives, like the cube 4d law, to wear their pelts like a fancy stitched hat. You can grow endlessly, though not necessarily quickly and can go toe-to-toe in physical might with beings an order of magnitude greater than yourself.%%%%You have gained the ability to kill anything, even that which can not die, that lacks the concept entirely, or was never alive to begin with; even the dead can die. Murdering an avatar would kill the source itself and what you kill ?stays dead. You can murder concepts like love or hope, though through more esoteric means; you could kill a concept in its entirety or just an instance of it, forcing ideas wherever they are to physically manifest so they can be destroyed.%%%%Any aspect of you or your power that is focused on death, destruction, consumption, chaos, war, poison, decay, entropy, madness, lies, hate, evil or the like is massively enhanced. Your touch can turn things to ember and dust instantly, your bite corrosive, your venom toxic to everything, and nothing - not even gods or greater cosmic entities or fate itself - can heal the wounds you inflict upon the world without your blessing. You are become death, the destroyer of worlds.,,
Útan Urd,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Urd, destiny, is not an absolute thing in the old myths. However, neither is free will. It is possible to alter the course of its flow in minor ways to avert or change events along the way but the nearer things get to the end the stronger and faster that flow becomes until eventually it becomes a fall. Though lives may be extended, this cannot be continued forever; it is a truth that the present must return to the past in order to begin anew, so to go against one's final end is akin to going directly against the full force torrent of destiny and history as it returns everything to the beginning.%%%%Your true nature makes you an exception to this. You walk above the currents of Urd and so while you can follow it if you so choose you are unimpeded by it's flow; if you were unlucky enough to come across your ordained final end you would find yourself the one being with the absolute free will to change%%%%%%For 300cp you can keep this advantage in future jumps and have also gained the gift of immortality, unaging and distant to the shores of time and death. You will not age, and are beyond the worry of disease or banal and mundane ailments. If the universe came crashing down to begin anew, you will find yourself standing upon its shores.,,
Viðurnafni,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,First Purchase Free%%%%?A nickname or title that you have earned. You can choose to be known by this and all who hear this title or nickname will know of your deeds and the truth that these deeds hold; they form a web of stories and events within your past that can be known.%%%%Every jump you may change the actual nickname and the details of the story that granted you this nickname and how widespread each nickname is. Beware if you do not possess the skills of such a title for should you be found out, doubt can spread to all the tales and titles for which you are known. This perk can write events or fake events into your backstory as needed in each jump, or simply carry the weight of the intent behind the title.%%%%Each title, whether true or false, whether believed or distrusted, carries weight and as such grows your hamingja.,,
Líf,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The first gift, life. You have been gifted a powerful soul and will. You are a skilled and well trained member or your race, fit enough to run, endure travel, and fight. You possess the reflexes and instincts to avoid freezing up and to hold your own against two or three normal warriors of your kind, though victory would prove difficult against more than one. You are competent at wielding bows, spears, knives, swords, axes and shields, and are comfortable wearing simple armor.%%%%Your body and appearance take on qualities of your choice, great enough to star in your own legendary saga. You could possess beauty enough to inspire poems, a heroic physique imposing enough to demand immediate respect in these lands, the roguish good looks to get away with a truly great deal of mischief, or a terrifying visage that could numb a mortal.%%%%Free for Vættir or greater.%%%%Free during the jump, 100 CP to keep.,,
Vit,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The second gift, of thought. You now hold a certain wit and charm about yourself; whatever your intelligence was before, you are at least above average now. You have also gained the skill of pithy retort and common banter, never again being at a loss for words.%%%%You also possess a talent for Flyting, argument as a contest, consisting of the exchange of insults, subterfuge, and shade, often conducted in verse, between two or more parties. It could be described as the art of eloquently insulting the opposition, usually as a prelude to battle, a battle in and of itself, or even as a friendly competition among comrades. While this perk doesn’t make you the best in the realms by itself, or even a master, you are an expert and could easily run circles around the common man.%%%%Free to Guðkunnigr or greater.%%%%Free during the jump, 100 CP to keep.,,
Jóð,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The third gift, of expression. Many times in many places it can be hard to understand or be understood. No longer, simply put you are omnilingual, you can learn, grasp, understand, and express yourself in any language you come across whether visual, auditory, pheromonal, or stranger you can learn to communicate with others in their language. You will never be misunderstood unless you desire to be so and you don't simply perceive the technicalities of the languages but have an intrinsic understanding of the feelings and emotions behind the language expressed.%%%%Free to ?Ginnregin? or greater.%%%%Free during the jump, 100 CP to keep.,,
Atgørvi,,1,,00,,False,,True,,First 100 CP purchase free, mutiple purchases possible%%%%Everyone has a skill, don't they, something they become known for; this is a single mundane skill of your choice.%%%%At ?100cp this skill is simply beyond peer by the standards of your kind, able to be counted within the realm of supernatural talent yet still within mortal grasp of understanding, as a swordsmith able to forge weapons that are too light and too sharp that could easily weather the ages environment or wear and tear even with sub par tools. As a runner being able to run upon the water or leap amongst the tree tops.%%%%At 200cp your talent has gone clearly into the realm of the supernatural skill, able to forge immaterial things like light or fire or wind into a blade or infuse it into your armor creating weightless objects, nearly indestructible weapons, or craft impossibly sharp edges as narrow as a wavelength from simple metals. If your skill was running, walking upon the air itself would be possible.%%%%At ?300cp your skills in your chosen area are only limited by your conceptual scope, forging the very idea of a blade out of the sounds of war, manifesting hopes or dreams into a shield. Gather the roots of mountains or the sound of a cat’s foot fall, forging truly indestructible objects immune to even being erased from time or casual loops. A runner able to outrun death and walk through dreams.%%%%%%At each purchase level your ability to learn, adapt, and master your talents within that skillset will grow by an order of 3, 9, or 27 with no cap to your abilities’ growth beyond the conceptual limitations of this purchase and with absolutely no end if purchased at 300cp.,,
Ríki,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Multiple purchases possible%%%%There are many beings with fantastical innate powers in the cosmos. Beings that can control the weather, change their form, or even nudge the course of destiny to obtain a desired outcome. This perk manifests as innate knowledge and influence over a domain. While ordinary mortals may only be able to display preternatural competence and relatively minor direct influence over their domain, beings with more innate power get increasingly more out of this even at the same purchase level.%%%%Choose a domain; this can be anything, a skill, an element of nature, or a concept. At a purchase of 200cp you would have this as a minor domain, wielding influence and power enough to astonish any being at your level, able to weaken or strength others within your concept, influence fate, or wield your element. A mortal with a domain over fire could provide substantial warmth on the coldest peaks of Everest, light buildings and large bonfires with a wave of the hand, "consume" an entire banquet for a hundred men in moments, or burn an enemy into ash. If of electricity, be able to power a small neighborhood of devices or call down a lightning bolt upon your enemy. A mortal with a minor domain over a kingdom would have a divine right to rule that land that no one could deny.%%%%At 400cp this is a ?major domain. A major mortal of fire would be able to rain down fire and pyroclastic flow like the second coming of Pompeii, create columns of flame to pierce the sky, or heal by burning away disease. A major mortal of war could will his side to victory in any battle he participates. A major mortal of a kingdom could call upon a force equal to all the power of the people and the land itself to shape that kingdom, build forts and increase performance in agriculture.,,
Nafn,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Multiple purchases possible%%%%?What is in a name holds many secrets. Firstly, you in all your forms are protected and secure within the power of your own true name, which can no longer be used against you. Choose a lesser being or race to your own and gain that form; it shall receive its own separate true name. You may take this form at will.%%%%No matter how familiar this form is to your other forms they will never be mistaken for each other, believed wholeheartedly to be seperate beings and nothing can pierce this perception unless you are observed taking on or dropping this form. You will gain an amount of lesser cp to spend on this form within this jump equal to half the amount of cp you spent on your main self; anything purchased with this lesser cp will be one third (1/3) as strong as if the purchase had been made by your greater self. The lesser form can not purchase this perk.%%%%Once per jump or every nine years, whichever comes first, this perk will act as a 1-up for any permanent death, mental entrapment, or imprisonment you wish; you safely appearing within a location of optimal choosing, locking you out of your main or lesser form as appropriate with only that "identity" dying.%%%%In future jumps each of your forms is separately provided all the real documentations, backgrounds, events, friends and families as needed to be within that world and prove your skills granting you spare identities and lives to slip into as needed with aspects shifting to accommodate these lives continuing as needed for your convenience. This will not let you be in two places at once but there will always be alibis for these other lives, friends having pictures and memories somehow, but anything notorious you do in one form will be retained. I.e., if you rob a bank in one form and it makes national news this won't provide that form with an alibi.,,
Upphaf,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,This is not simply a domain over something, you are the embodiment of this something. %%%%ithout you this very thing or idea does not exist within whatever worlds you find yourself, the primordial of strength could never be beaten in a test of strength and all who would wield it do so at its discretion. A being of dream would be both the mantle, all its endless worlds, and every part of its story; one of death would not be just as the grim reaper, but the existential dread of endings. You could be the very thing of time itself and there by alter its nature, as you are its nature. You can not select something as broad as The World or Matter but Time, Space, Life, Death, Land, Sea are all options , but so are smaller concepts such as being the embodiment of a specific river or a specific star or the concept of stars themselves.%%%%The more power you have the greater influence that power has within the worlds and if there are other beings that act as this embodiment in future worlds you may replace, war with, coexist, or subvert them as you see fit, always carrying your concept with you. Due to your influence over this concept you can materialize it as you wish freely; bottle up hope, lightning, or time, wield victory as a banner, shine the light of day upon the secrets of the world, or manifest dream into reality only limited by your power.%%%%As an embodiment you hold the characteristics of your concept and you can no more be harmed by anything that could not destroy your very concept itself. The more specific your concept the greater the influence and power this concept holds and you hold over it; and if you held both a major domain over and embodiment of a single concept you would have absolute power and control in that aspect or realm.,,
Sjálfr Sjálfum Mér,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Whether it was by following the footsteps of Odin and hanging yourself from a branch of Yggdrasil, by killing a dragon and eating its roasted heart, or by other means, you have obtained Wisdom. As a result your sight has expanded beyond mundane perception. You can now, with focus, reach out with your senses to perceive the past, present and future, and realms beyond. How far you can see varies depending on many factors and what is near is easier to see than what is far away but with sufficient knowledge, power, experience and a very good vantage point, you will one day be capable of seeing the entirety of the Nine Realms and beyond.%%%%Wisdom fertilized you and caused you to change in ways that cannot be easily measured or explained. Your spiritual weight is greater now and so destiny cannot easily pull you along. On the contrary, you find it easier to enact change on its course, to a degree measured by your own power and means. No destiny is truly absolute when you are involved.%%%%This is a perk capstone booster.,,
Warrior - Hreysti Vægher,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You possess two qualities that separate a common warrior from a hero. The first is a fire in your chest. It burns through the greatest of fears and bodily pains and can drive you into eagerly achieving feats you would not have believed yourself capable of before. Where before you could have held off three men you would now have the ferocity to defeat them. It would take strong unnatural influences to make your spirit waver.%%%%But valor alone can lead to an early grave and so you also possess the discipline to accurately assess your surroundings and your own limits and to keep a cool head despite your burning heart without either diminishing the other. This also allows you to always be aware of your true feelings and desires beneath the flaring emotions of the present.,,
Warrior - Megin,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You are the ideal of a warrior made flesh. Not only do you have impeccable fighting instincts that allow you to instantly spot any weaknesses and opportunities present in a battlefield and fight in extreme environments, such as underwater, as easily as you can on solid ground but you also possess an indomitable physique.%%%%Your strength is great enough to fight monsters and giants barehanded and tear the weaker ones limb from limb. Your vitality so potent that you could swim through an icy ocean for days and nights non stop, fighting sea monsters all the while, as well as hold your breath for hours at a time. Your speed and reflexes are such that you could keep up with and react to some of the fiercest creatures in the realms or a small contingent of men without being overwhelmed.%%%%A mind of such keen intellect as to create and perceive ideal strategic capability, so as a force of three hundred could take on nine thousand to a stalemate, or even just one to a force of 30 times greater but less keen in thought, and write poetry of such magnitude as to be remembered for all of time.%%%%And finally, your peerless insight into the world and ability to perceive the stress points, fracture planes, or weaknesses within the physical, psychological, spiritual, or even supernatural, in all objects, persons, or even concepts or ideas around you.%%%%By striking and applying pressure at these points, you can split or shatter objects made of seemingly invincible substances or render insensate beings of far greater strength than yourself. This mental discipline is virtually effortless even in the heat of battle. It won't necessarily give you the means to leverage these weaknesses against your target, and it absolutely won't create a weakness where there was none, but this skill is formidable and can be used more generally to build better structure, forge weaknesses out of weapons and armor, or perceive the failings in society so as to act as a better ruler.,,
Warrior - Baldr,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The bold and the beautiful. First the bold, choose an archetype like hero of the people, eternal guardian, black knight, super villain, or even mundane things like substitute teacher. You will know how to act, talk, and behave to present this image perfectly; the expectations and stereotypes of the role and how to subvert them; how to promote your personal reputation and fame while filling or subverting this role.%%%%You will have or quickly gain all the skills necessary to fill this role and when and how to use them most effectively. You will be perceived as the ideal embodiment of this position to the point that you can easily take advantage of the presumptions of others who will not believe you to step out of this role. This is culture and setting specific so a villain in norse myth will be very different than a villain in a james bond movie.%%%%You don't just have the ability to subvert this role though, if you find aspects of this role disagree able through your action and presentaion the role will change in time to your ideal; feel like monologuing in a James Bond setting is dumb and the villains over time will take after your example and stop. It might take time but the idea of a supervillain could be shifted to overtaking the position of an anti-hero in the same vein as the role shift seen in Megamind. If you soften the archetype of the super villain - such as to forbid killing - there will be a minor compulsion and peer pressure for others to change their ways, with those refusing to change being considered less villains and maybe just idiots and douchebags.%%%%You have leeway for your actions to subvert or actually shift the role; even if not the most powerfull or strongest or most feared you will be the standard to which all others of that archetype are held. This will never hinder you and can be toggled on and off in part or whole as needed, just walking into a bank they may not assume you are there to rob it, or they may and be terrified but wont jump the gun and kick you out or call the cops until you actually do something.%%%%You know how to make your boasts truly impressive and inspiring, how to approach challenges to earn as much glory as can be had from them and how to skillfully rebuke naysayers without provoking undue ire. You can live as a warrior while making society and the law work for you rather than against you and these skills continue to work on any society no matter how removed they may be from the mythic Norse culture.%%%%Every new universe/jump you visit you may choose a new archetype, retaining all your skills and abilities and knowhow from the old one but it not being attached to your identity within the new place.%%%%%%Second, Beauty. Beauty is not a matter of appearance, it is a skill in grace and you are most graceful. Under the geas of your appearance no challenge is impossible, nothing truly beyond your reach. Any challenge or quest issued that you answer, even if it would have previously been truly impossible, is now ever so slightly within the realm of your capabilities. But sometimes that is not enough, sometimes the ugly resort to cheating and this can not be permitted as it would tarnish such victories.%%%%Within your purview the acts of others cheating simply fails, sabotage will undo itself, riging will, those committed to sweep their own or throw a match will find that they wish to be as beautiful as you and act with grace and distinction; all forms of others cheating will fail without exception and darkness will be exposed. Your beauty casts doubt upon those who, with darkness in their heart, come for you; they are compelled to honor, less likely to strike you from the back or attempt to poison your drink, harbor dark plots, conspiracies may crumble, and if someone succeeds in such villainy, never shall they go without exposure to the light of day.,,
Warrior - Hamrammr,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have achieved unification with a spirit of wilderness by ritual communion with nature. While the most common choices for warriors were to be Berserkir (Bear), Úlfhéðnar (Wolf), or Svinfylking (Boars), you are free to choose any animal to build your shamanic state off of. No matter the animal you choose, the benefits are great as you become one with your inner animal spirit, representative of all of the strengths, nature, and capabilities of the Hamr it possesses.%%%%You are now a bridge between civilization and wilderness, one with the natural order, able to be in the balance with nature and understand disturbances in the great tapestry, both their causes and solutions. This perception expands into perceiving the role of man and how your two conflicting natures can complement each other.%%%%Talents of magic and skill that you wield dealing with hunting, agriculture, animal care, survival, and nature are doubled and you have unnerant instincts and ease in learning and developing these skills. Your wild instincts and senses are honed to a razor edge beyond what was previously capable for you, while all your instincts and senses are improved, one or two are now beyond compare, eyes of an eagle, the smell of a wolf, or so forth; you have a preternatural ability to sense danger and even the most carefully hidden aggression. Navigating through and surviving in the wilderness is second nature to you, even the most inhospitable locations are merely inconvenient as long as it's possible for a species to survive in them. You have gained an animal magnetism and the ability to understand and commune with animals of shared spirit and they with you.%%%%Much like your senses and instincts, all of your physical capabilities are improved, with one based on your hamr of choice becoming the thing of legends: strength for bears, agility or speed for wolves, and stamina or endurance for boars as just a few examples. You gain the ability to enter a battle frenzy to receive the sacred gift of ÓÐR, divine ecstasy, fury, and inspiration. Óðr is the source of poetic inspiration and philosophical insight as well as battle frenzy, with all of its grotesqueness and violence, is of a rarefied poetic sort – and, being a gift from the divine, it is inherently sacred.%%%%While in this state you are capable of fighting with supernatural ferocity as blows are turned away by the force of your spirit and your physical capabilities become several times greater. From within this state comes an endless rage as crazed as hungry wolves and as strong as mother bears, biting shields and slaying men, while you are harmed by neither fire nor iron, you can draw upon the unbridled wrath of nature itself within you and direct it towards your ends.%%%%You obtain the ability to become one with your inner beast. You can don the hamr of an animal and assume its form. Increasing your physical attributes and capabilities proportionally to the difference between the animal and a normal human. You can also astrally project yourself or your wilderness spirit through the realms and and even into dreams, having a vague awareness of what your other experiences till you rejoin.%%%%%%Capstone Boosted%%No longer simply hamrammr, you are eigi einhamr and able to hamhleypa or walk out of your own skin, instead of simply being able simply astral project out of your own body, you may take the hamr with you able to manifest both physically and spiritually or have your animal spirits do the same each hamr adding to your wilderness spirits, each one you, each one able to manifest separately.%%%%Unlike before where you had a vague awareness of your others, you are all now perfectly aware of yourself. You also gain another Hamr of your choice with all the benefits that would entail, this will apply to any hamr you later purchase in the item section. You are now able to clearly commune with all of nature, not just the animals and plants but with streams, rocks, and the breeze, while this may seem like an easy task the gods, most gods are only able to commune with some aspects with very few such as Frigg and Freyja able to communicate with all.%%%%You have obtained Wisdom by eating the roasted heart of a slain dragon. But before you did so you bathed in the dragon's blood, making your flesh invulnerable to physical damage. No mundane force can pierce you, to deal damage or to harm; regardless of scale, any damage would have to come from non-physical, divine, or magical sources.%%%%While bathing in the dragon's blood you drank from it, granting you understanding and the ability to speak the language of birds. Birds you speak to gain insight into the more subtle dangers approaching your person and are compelled to warn you of such threats and try to intervene. Simple understanding of this language imparts you words with greater weight and meaning, more easily swaying those with your tongue and enhancing all magics and abilities cast through the medium of sound song and story and actually using the language is even greater still.%%%%Lastly you have gained the Hamr of a great dragon, a titanic wurm on par with Fáfnir capable of flight, moving mountains, raising castles, turning kingdoms to ash, or poisoning the land itself. Your mortal physicality doubled again, but your transformed selves an order of magnitude greater still as the dragon wields the pinnacle of all hamr.,,
Trickster - Inspired,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You possess a natural wit and cunning that would leave the ordinary man dumbfounded. As long as it's possible you can often think your way past the most vexing problems on the fly and flashes of inspiration often lead you to surprising and unorthodox but effective solutions.%%%%,,
Trickster - Vixla Hömum Skipta Hömum,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Many beings change hamr in different ways for different reasons, but now you have a gift of forms unseen by most. You could live freely as an otter or a tree or rest as a stone beside the sea if you so enjoyed with none the wiser, any natural form within this world you wish to take is yours even so as to appear to be as someone else. You could grow to be a giant or dragon in size and shape but your strength and gifts would not grow with it, only ever as powerful as you were. As a man you could be a full woman and bear children or as a woman be a man and provide seed, even as other species.%%%%This provides a mastery of disguise, cloak, and dagger, even when not using this gift to take form, and a mastery to remain hidden beyond even Heimdall's gaze and prying eyes.,,
Trickster - At Inom Hvíta Helga Steini,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,?The art of a deal and a debt. You now have learned and hold an intuitive knowledge and understanding of deals, gambles, contracts, oaths, truths and half-truth, prices, debts, bargains, trades, exploits, loopholes, laws, and all manner of such things that would make the like of any demon or trickster god like Mephistopheles stare in bewilderment of such prodigious genius.%%%%You know how to take advantage of this gift and the buttons to push in people to exploit them. But what good is a deal without the means to enforce such arrangements? All deals that you partake in are backed by fate, chance, the world, the powers that be and probability in greater proportions than your own.%%%%As a mortal commoner, the king and his army or perhaps even some elves or a Disir would get involved to enforce such a deal, as one of the Vanir all of mother earth would rush to enforce, the wrath of all of nature, the spirits, the valkyries and fate itself, if the scope of your power were beyond that even omnipotent beings could be trapped, bound, and cursed by a contract with you.%%%%That's not to say such overt displays of enforcement are necessary, it's simply an example of the backing you possess. What's more is this perview extends to any deal made in your presence when you so desire, off handed, handshaken, simply spoken, or otherwise; if a drunken man at a bar absently says he would give his wife and farm for just one more drink and you hear it, it's a deal and all that was promised is yours or someone elses for one more drink if you so wish to enforce it.%%%%These insurances do not apply against you, however if you don't follow through with your end this backing will not be there and if you break other peoples' deals enough you may become known as an oathbreaker and cheat so no one will want to deal with you.%%%%Oaths were so valued among the gods that Odin asked his friend at a gathering to stand up and give his seat to Loki, who had just killed his son Baldr not long before, so that they could drink together because in their youth Odin said he would not sit and drink in revelry if Loki was not afforded such opportunity also, this level of compulsion is present in all your dealings.,,
Trickster - Afarkaup Avarkostir,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Everything has a price in norse mythology and there is no means around that, but the price is sometimes negotiable or able to be paid by others, and you have already paid a great price it seems and in return this gift. The cost for you will be reduced by an order of 3 and your gains will be increased by an order of 3. The cost of what? Anything within reason really.%%%%If you went to purchase a cow for 50 gold, you'd hand over 17gold and get 3 cows instead or one cow that was 3 times better. How does that work; like, where do the extra cows come from? Seriously, just roll with it. If you were crafting a sword it would take up a third of the material and you might get three copies of it; it would take a third of the time to craft and be of three times higher quality. You can not cycle items this way by repurchasing something that has been acquired, enhanced, multiplied, or made through this, but god help the money markets as it's still fairly exploitable.%%%%Working out for an hour will take 20 minutes and only a third of the stamina and provide growth as if you worked out for three hours and received 3 times the gains per hour. While it can never reduce your cp cost, purchasing things like levels in an rpg setting with exp, items, or cp will grant you 3 times the amount, it functions as you please either in a gestalt fashion or increasing your capacity for hard limits and levels by an order of 3. You will receive 3 of any item purchased with cp.%%%%The costs you pay are now indifferent to the specifications, if you make a contract with a demon for your soul, you can substitute in anyone else's unless there are other stipulations like a powerful or good soul, if the specifications are for unique items or things so rare they might as well be, you may all but ignore such specificities with even a glancing notion of an attempt for equivalency. The ability to substitute is in direct proportion to how specific the deal is meant to be, how rare the thing being paid is, and how personal it is to you; something like gold you may MAY be able to switch out for jewels gemstones and other currencies if the dealer isn't a stickler but you could not switch out for fool's gold and receive the benefits of this perk, an heirloom magic necklace thats been in your family for generations could be switched out for a necklace of similar craft and make containing some magic blessings. This will not stop people from noticing a substitution has been made or getting miffed about it, but the deal will be considered valid if you try to stay within reason.%%%%%%Capstone Boosted%%Everything and everyone has a price and you know exactly what it is in a dollar figure or some other form of currency and trade. If no one has the authority to sell something to you, the cost can be sacrificed as a kind of ritual removing it from the world.%%%%Everyone knows what you've purchased is yours and you know if someone tries to steal your stuff. This extends to services also but it can't force someone to do something if they absolutely wouldn't do it under any circumstances, otherwise, you know exactly how much this service costs, unless it involves selling you something, then they have to sell it. As a nice aside you no longer need to track down the owner of the items, just yell out in the museum that you are purchasing a painting and just like batman acquiring a fancy hotel on a whim it will work itself out.%%%%You hold power over the things you own and may wield them completely and freely as you wish. You may place any arbitrary restrictions on that which you own and it can never be used against you unless you permit it to be so; all that is yours can be revoked and returned to you with ease. Objects, ideas, powers, gifts, thoughts, and skills acquired on loan or temporary trade count as yours for the full duration of the deal and can not be revoked and under deals or offers set for indeterminate durations they are permanent and irrevocable even if the contract is violated as they are now yours completely and utterly, I pity the fool who lets you borrow their hammer.,,
Healer - Bældæg,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Many believe some of the greatest gifts you can receive are love and happiness. No matter who it is, no matter where you go, people will have a great first impression of you and tend to like you. The more negative or abrasive aspects of your personality behavior will be immediately shunted in their minds like your friends who have gotten used to the fact that you always talk to loud or are a bit pushy.%%%%This is not a cure all, if your personality and someone else's don't gel this will not force true friendship, but it's a better start than almost anyone in real life gets. No more will someone be irritated with you simply because you showed up on their work break and people will always give you the benefit of the doubt. Becoming a celebrity is going to be way easier.%%%%But on a more personal note, if you've ever wondered how some people can just be carefree and happy you've now got that gift scalable and toggleable at will, reignite your childhood sense of joy and wonder at will. You may optionally give off light and glow soothing warmth at will, enough for you to not to have to worry about needing a camp fire on mount everest for you and some close friends.,,
Healer - Fjölkyngi,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Magic, True Magic in the world of Norse myth is telling a lie so convincing the world has no choice but to listen. Well that is what a certain version of Loki says and, funnily enough, he is not that wrong. Songs, music, stories, poetry, art, and oaths all have power. They have the power to change the world both figuratively and literally. The gift of magic combines multiple skills together and through will and power it enacts change.%%%%You have gained a gift and talent for using magic, which most mortals can not perform. Odin is particularly adept at songs to change the hearts of men to turn them into great burning warriors with skin stronger than iron and swoo women to his will. Frigg used this art to request oaths on behalf of her son protecting him from all harm and soothing fires in minds and homes. Because there is no better healer than preventing harm in the first place, you are particularly adept at that kind of magic.,,
Healer - Véurr Véoðr Vingþórr,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,?Hallower. Thor is often thought of as a war god and he is, but he is much more. Thor is also the god of purification. You now hold this power, you can break any curse, wash away any poison (yes, norse mythology is full of irony), burn away any disease, consecrate any land or sustenance, refine any metal, or even clean the environment. You may do this in a similar manner to Thor.%%%%Choose a destructive element like ice, lightning, or fire, you gain control over this element and may wield it like Thor wields lighting, you may break things and purify them with your element then restore them except now cleansed. This also may mend or repair things, objects, places, and the like freely, but it can not replace what is lost. You may even perform this action on souls. Or you may be kind and skip the destructive part of your cleansing.%%%%Things you have consecrated could be considered holy or sacred, lands will become more verdant, bodies more vital, metals more mystical. All these abilities grow with your power over your chosen element.%%%%Oh , as an aside you can freely ordain marriages with the full backing of the universe no questions asked mister preacherman. It will be accepted as legal, even where it normally wouldn’t be.,,
Healer - Valkyrja,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Choosers of the Slain, beings of great and terrifying power most likely elevated by Odin from among the Disir to a position closer to being a minor deity than a messenger or angel(no matter how much you look the part) acting as an extension of Odin's power and will. You have equally been elevated in power and gifts to being considered among them, if you were among the Guðkunnigr you would be equal in every way to your fellow sisters of battle becoming a very minor deity of war, death, fire, weather, healing, victory, and fate. You do not simply carry the worthy among the dead to valhalla, you choose who lives or dies, the victors and losers, in mortal battles and wars under your gaiz. You and any mount you ride is gifted with flight, under your own power, far faster than you could move on foot; at any point you may or may not have a pair of powerful awe inspiring wings. At anytime you may compose yourself out of fire and sunlight. You are free; no prison, bindings, spell, or charm can hold or restrict you or your mind or soul, no barricade can block your path. You are a bridge between the realm of the living and the dead, not restricted to either. You are an unparalleled warrior even amongst the impossible standards of the gods, skilled in every weapon or art of war with strength, speed, and strategy to match. Any of your gifts and ability to wield true magic will grow to be unparalleled by mortal standards. Short of true death you may heal and cure anyone of natural any natural disease, wound, or ailment whether physical, mental , spiritual, or something more esoteric. Your beauty is beyond compare able to strike mortals dumbstruck.%%%%%%Capstone Boosted%%You are now as Freya or Frigg, beyond a minor deity, a full on goddess by your own rights. You are the most beautiful person who has ever lived, able to strike gods dumb by revealing your full glory. Your power and skills are equally enhanced and you have become a lesser personification of freedom and hope. Your magic wielding now on par with the greatest gods of magic. You can heal and cure anything natural or otherwise given enough time and raising the dead is as easy as breathing. But more importantly you are now a chooser in your own right, no longer simply able to choose the worthy dead for valhalla you can choose for any realm. You gain an innate understanding of any being, their sins, their hopes, their desires, and their worthiness. You now hold first pick and claim among the dead. Like Freyja and her hall Sessrúmnir in Fólkvangr, you gain your own afterlife within the realms to hold your dead. Like Odin, you may elevate beings to a status similar to the valkyries, granting fragments and aspects of power dependent on your own and theirs. In worlds with afterlives of their own, psychopomps will automatically consider yours valid, and any gods that rule over the dead will accept you as a peer.,,
Teacher - Mímir,,1,,1000,,False,,True,,Hamingja Required%%%%You possess a powerful mind and your memory is formidable. You cannot forget anything you have ever experienced and you can instantly recall anything you know. Your mind will never run out of space to store information and all knowledge will be indexed in its proper place without fail. Even things you have forgotten before this will fall under this effect, once more appearing in their proper place in your mind.%%%%Your intellect is also among the best in the realms. Mental and scholarly pursuits come easily and naturally to you and you have an easy time comprehending new and complex ideas as you encounter them.,,
Teacher - Gangleri Gangari,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Hamingja Required%%%%You possess the gift to traverse the nine realms and beyond. You are free, as long as you are free to journey, to journey wherever you please, no land too distant or kingdom unknown. You can even travel to places beyond physical reach given time. No tireless journey by foot or under your own power would take more than the cycle of the moon or 27 nights and upon the back of a mighty steed no journey would take more than 9. This also provides you and your steeds the stamina to survive such long treks over natural terrains without break. While this does not provide any specific safety or protection from the environment or allow you to bypass blockades, walls, gates and the like it will let you come to the edge and interact if need be and improves what capabilities you hold while journeying.%%%%,,
Teacher - Haptasnytrir Foldardróttinn,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Hamingja Required%%%%?Like Odin, eternal seeker of knowledge, you have a gift for learning, not simply in a sense of being able to learn faster than most, but by more esoteric means being able to locate long lost or forbidden knowledge and skills, beings who have refused prior students will never refuse you, instinctively knowing where to go and what to do to acquire more knowledge and exploit it for your advantage. Your learning speed, capacity, and intuition expanded by an order of magnitude and quests to find or locate such things equally shortened.%%%%But what good is knowledge if you cannot exploit it, you now possess the ability to teach anybody almost anything, even if they are incapable to use that knowledge. You could teach a mortal how to wield divine power to create life and they would understand exactly how it works and would be capable of doing as such if they gain the ability to wield said divine power. Whenever you teach people anything, you gain power over them and what they have learned, gaining more power over them the more you teach and the more they wield your knowledge and skills.%%%%You could teach someone to be a great fisherman, but make it so they could only catch catfish and these restrictions can be selectively applied as they teach others in a chain of learning. You could teach the world magic and runes and make it so those gifts could never be used against you, or that no matter how skilled and knowledgeable they become they are unable to teach anyone these things, their mind becoming a momentarily blank. Even a third party observing you or your students would be unable to learn anything without your permission, even something as simple as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, however this won't stop them from making a PB&J on their own, they just won't be able to recall how you made it if they saw you do it they literally would not associate the name of the sandwich with those ingredients.%%%%If the knowledge from you is so intrinsic to a person that it is how they make a living or is what they are know for or is used in everyday life you would have the ability to manipulate their fate similar to the Norns with lesser control based on lesser connection of that knowledge, you could manipulate the fates of an entire kingdom, world or further with this. Students under you will be able to learn what you have to teach faster as if their intelligence, talent, capacity, and learning speed was increased by an order of magnitude.%%%%You are a plotter and can easily come up with both direct and indirect ways of obtaining what you want. To your eyes obstacles look like opportunities and challengers like people bearing gifts. Moreover, when seeking something that you cannot obtain or achieve at the moment the steps and measures you must take to accomplish your will naturally fall into place in your mind given a bit of time.%%%%But plans are nothing without the will to see them done. You have that will. Your determination is such that you can ignore or power through anything that would seek to stop you, should you choose to do so. From pain to loss to uncertainty to even the greatest social pressure there is nothing that can deter you from your goals but your own judgement. This will even let you break free from unnatural mental influences with effort,,
Teacher - Seiðr,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Hamingja Required%%%%A powerful form of skill concerned with discerning the course of destiny and enacting their wills upon the world by viewing the Oorlog and ways of the wyrd. To do this, the practitioner relies on various means to enter a trance and travel in spirit across the Nine Realms to accomplish their intended task. This can take the form of prophecies, blessings, or curses.%%%%There are seiðr rituals for divination and clairvoyance; for seeking out the hidden, both in the secrets of the mind and in physical locations; for healing the sick; for bringing good luck; for controlling the weather; for calling game animals and fish. It can also be used for the opposite of these things – to curse an individual or an enterprise; to blight the land and make it barren; to induce illness; to tell false futures and thus to set their recipients on a road to disaster; to injure, maim and kill, in domestic disputes and especially in battle%%%%%%Capstone Boosted%%Not content with simply knowing and being one with the tapestry of fate, you sought Wisdom for the sake of knowledge, cosmic secrets, and the ability to change it; you willingly hung yourself by the neck on a branch of Yggdrasil after piercing yourself with a weapon and peered downward towards the Well of Urd at the base of the World Tree surviving in this state, teetering on the precipice between life and death for nine days and nights, until finally you were found worthy, embodying arts of fate, rune, magic and weaving with which you have now gained supernatural skill. While often used simply as a written language by mortals, the runes are truth, symbols that represent some of the most powerful forces in the cosmos. Each rune allows one who comprehends their mysteries to access, interact with, and influence the fundamental forces of the world that they represent.%%%%While Odin was initiated into runic knowledge by perceiving 18 runes, these do not represent all of the runes and Odin wields them very simplistically. Compared to the Norns, who delicately utilize the runes on a grand scale to weave fate for the nine realms in an intricate tapestry, Odin is like the first man to crudely discover fire and proceed to wage war with its strength. You now have the wisdom, knowledge, skills, and power of the three Norns and Odin in wielding the runes. You will also gain 18 of your own runes unknown and unknowable by even the Norn, unless you teach them, and the sisters may or may not be willing to pay a high price for the knowledge of even one such new rune.%%%%With this new knowledge you can use the Runes by chanting or writing them to heal emotional and bodily wounds, bind your enemies and render their weapons worthless, free yourself from constraints, put out fires, expose and banish practitioners of malevolent magic, protect those you favor in battle, wake the dead, create and preserve love, and perform many other feats like these.,,
Monster - Útan Ätt,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Angrboða Required%%%%?Racism? Clanism? Familyism? These kinds of groupthink, to put it lightly, are rude and wrong on so many levels. Sadly, solving those issues might not be possible, especially in a world like this. But I can give you the next best thing. You will no longer suffer by association.%%%%You will not be judged by your race, skin color, eye color, hair color, last name, who you work with or who you for. You will be judged and evaluated based solely on yourself and your own personal actions and how well they relate or are known by specific people and situations. You could work for a mass murderer but as long as you weren't do any of the actual killing or operations and were just a secretary no amount of ire will fall onto you for what the group does. As a black man in the segregated south you could walk up to a white's only hospital and they would treat you the same as any rich white land owning donator of the facility. You will always get the benefit of the doubt no matter how monsterous you look. You could be a Mccoy and have just as easy of a time proposing marriage to a Hatfield.%%%%Simply put you are immune to relational judgments, even if you are an orc or goblin elvish blades and witcher talismans wont glow to warn their master. But this also goes a bit further, if a sword requires a descendant or blood relation to a specific person to use or if dragon eggs only bond to humans, you can fill in for any of those positions just fine. In some universes Thor's hammer requires you to be worthy and this perk won't let you slide on that, Sorry.%%%%What, you want more? This origin is too expensive for something so middling? Fine. You now have a passive resistance to attacks, powers, abilities, and events, really almost anything, that does not specifically target you. The more generalized the association or intent toward you, the greater the resistance will be, but if you are the specific target no resistance is provided. If an evil wizard throws a fireball at your party trying to get rid of your team, you would get a pretty solid bonus depending on how many people in the blast radius or team you have( 50% if two of you, 65% if there are three, 75% if there are four, 80% if there are 5, and so forth). However, if that wizard was specifically trying to get rid of you and there just happens to be other people on your team or in the beast, this perk will not protect you. If someone happened to drop a nuke on your city and it wasn't done to specifically kill you, your probably walking away with barely a scratch. This will only apply to negative effect; group healers are still you best friends.,,
Monster - Hólmganga,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Angrboða Required%%%%?Mortal Kombat!, legalised robbery, standardized property acquisitions? whichever you prefer. You now have the power to lay a claim, whether legitimate or not, on anything you have the power to possess. In doing so, you challenge the owner to a fight to the death or concession over the claim. If you win, you own whatever the claim is over. As a mortal from these realms you may be able to, at most, lay claim to an entire kingdom or a title that someone possesses, but as a higher being you could lay claim to more metaphysical things such as a power or ability that you can trade in, or years off someone's life.%%%%You must still follow all the rites of the hólmganga, allowing an ample amount of time for an individual to respond to a claim, the respondent can substitute in a champion, and rules to the event can be negotiated. Your free to not have it be to death or even have the match over a children's card game if the other party agrees, but if no agreement can be met, the event defaults into a one on one fight to the death or concession. When making a claim over something that is owned or held by multiple people, you may have to fight them all individually, taking a piece of the claim with each victory or set up a tournament to establish a final claim. Refusal to meet your challenge grants your claim automatically.%%%%This power is backed by fiat, as your claim is true, your property or titles and powers are yours by right, but it is enforced by your metaphysical level. A mortal would have the full enforcement of the government in your claims but a god may have the enforcement of the universe itself. Killing someone as part of these rites, if they do not concede or there are no rules against it, do not constitute a crime or violation; you have the right to make these claims, though people may come to despise you for it.%%%%As a side bonus, you may always claim a trial by combat and it will be honored, even in civilised democracies, or the insanity persecutions of the salem witch trials and spanish inquisitions.,,
Monster - Utlagr Vargr,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Angrboða Required%%%%?Magics are often rare and misunderstood things; charms and gifts not often connected to the needs of the many, but are tied to the desires of the few. Your magic is dark and terrifying, feeding on and growing the Niþ of the world around you. ?Any dark or black magics that you wield from this or other worlds will be amplified by an order of magnitude. ?This provides you a host of talents that are subsequently enhanced by the very magic this perk provides.%%%%As only a mortal, you will be gifted with all the skills and abilities needed to be a ?well respected thief , assassin, ninja, mercenarie, murderer, bandit, marauder, and corrupt politicians, your dark magics silencing your steps and actions, enhancing the lethality of your poisons and blades, blending you into the shadows and speeding up your movements, and your speeches inciting hatred and fear as desired. As a vættir with hammingja, you would also be the epitome of the dark witch in the woods or evil sorcerer, a true mirror of entities such as Grímhildr or ?Gullveig able to curse others into illness or death, afflict with pain, sorrow, or ugliness with but a word and move as a living shadow whisking children away to their deaths, to hear your name whispered, you could raise the dead as spectors, revenants, or draugr by infusing your or their own hatred and dark desires back into their corpse.%%%%A ginnregin would have gifts allowing them to act as a poor substitute for the Grimreaper or Hel herself.,,
Monster - Rétt-ligr,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Angrboða Required%%%%?You are the embodiment of all the fear, hatred, envy, greed, anger, and negativity that is directed toward you. Quite literally, you hold lesser domains and personifications to a vast number of negative aspects from poison, venom, illness, plague, death and decay, to malice, shadows, darkness, sorrow, hate, war, anger and so forth. All those negative feelings, if directed at you personally, empowering you and making you stronger, the norse gods do not need worship to be mighty and neither do you, but you will grow mighter in every aspect from these negative forces and can substitute these feelings for genuine worship in all areas.%%%%You are an endless well from which these emotions may be drawn either by yourself or others. All of this darkness manifests as a curse upon any who would harm you, any being that brings harm to you in any way , either directly or indirectly, will be cursed to the same level of injury or maybe even a bit more. If you would be cut, they receive an equally detrimental injury. If they harmed your child, they and their children may be struck with bad luck and illness. But should you be killed by the influence of another or kill yourself as a sacrifice, you may declare a death curse in response. This death curse will kill anything, normally being instant, if a being is equal in power and yet has protections your curse will take no longer than nine days, a lesser being with protections may take nine hours or a greater being nine months or even up to nine years, nine months, nine days, and nine hours..., but the curse will kill them no matter who or what they are accordingly.%%%%%%Capstone Boosted%%People in this world really don't understand the big picture or their place in it, but you have an idea, a general sense of the great tapestry so to speak. Wherever you go, you now have the ability to see the great tapestry of the world and the machinations behind it. Like all that is black within the world you act as a great tide bringing the world back to its roots or sweeping aside the chaff for a new beginning.%%%%All the powers and abilities that you possess of darkness, death, poison, destruction, and so forth can now be applied equally within the realms of healing, love, growth, flowers, joy, creation, and life. The inverse is also true and your powers have expanded to make you a minor deity and personification of change, decline, renewal, and revolution.%%%%It would suck if your powers, abilities, and weapons also discriminated, I would dare say that it might be a bit hypocritical of those gifts. So, your powers don't discriminate unless you want them to do so per their normal function. Have a spell that can only resurrect or heals humans? Now it will bring back dogs, cats, dinosaurs, elfs, robots, even gods if they are within your realms of power, whatever else you want to include within a category. Engineered a plague that only kills people with brown hair, well now it can be just as effective against blondes. You are the great equalizer.,,
An Epic Soundtrack,,2,,00,,False,,True,,At any time you may have an epic soundtrack of old and new original music, just for you and your adventures, by the likes of Richard Wagner, Patrick Doyle, Brian Tyler, and Mark Mothersbaugh.

Fylgja,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,First free, multiple purchases possible%%%%?Much like Odin's two crows, you've now picked yourself up a familiar. These spirits take the form of an animal and are intrinsically part of your being. Normally, if harm came to one's Fylgja, harm would come directly to one's own self, but you will be exempt from this and any Fylgja will just disappear and be able to be resummoned by you if harmed.%%%%Intrinsically they are part of your soul expressed into the physical world able to freely enter dreams, realms of the dead, thoughts, or other esoteric conceptual spaces carrying messages and acting as heralds. It takes a great being to even have one, and each one represents a very slight growth in your luck and power. They are able to function and benefit in any way familiar should and you can express your power through them. They are spirits and as such do not have mortal needs.%%%%You will gain one free for each hamr you possess, corresponding to that hamr, including your starting one, so everyone gets one free. Those purchased here can only be mundane animals. They can do anything a normal animal of its kind can do, they love you and are loyal because they are part of you but they are still animals. If someone tried to read your mind or soul they would find a menagerie of beasts, having a Fylgja allows you to think as that animal and grows your hamingja.,,
Mannvirðing,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,First purchase free, mupliple purchases possible%%%%?Honour. Titles can be granted for many things. This is not a seperate name, or being known as a different person, this is simply something you are known for. Choose a title for yourself, you will be known for this or as a monikr. Invoking this claim to fame will have sway in certain circles, but be wary, your titles will become connected to each other. You will become known for all your deeds and where one title may have brought allies before, the attachment of another may harm your reputation with the same people, may be best to go with neutral titles, "giant slayer" may be a problem down the line. Each title represents a growth in your power, luck, fame, and your hamingja.,,
Disir,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Multiple purchases possible%%%%?You've got a minor divine being in your corner. As a mortal or lesser spirit, this being will act as a very involved guardian angel able to be summoned or dismissed at will, protecting you from harm and dispensing advice. It is as if wonder woman was protecting you and only you, or whatever you ask them to protect, such as a land or treasure. As a greater being, they will still function in their old capacity, but will also act as humble servants, friends, or agents at you discretion. If you have the ability to ascend beings such as make new valkyries, they may start ascended to your fullest capabilities without cost to you. They are loyal to a fault, viewing you as their charge, if you have a personality clash with one, you may freely change them out to one with a different personality.,,
Yggdrasill Mímameiðr,,2,,-5000,,False,,True,,A world tree all your own. This is a metaphysical-ish literal-ish tree whose roots and branches will expand into other realms on their own and to any world you travel to yourself. You can freely travel along the tree's paths to get to any other realm it is connected to. This tree will not let you travel to previous jumps until you gain a spark.%%%%You can put the tree wherever you like in each setting or keep it within your warehouse. No one can travel by way of your tree without your permission and restriction upon the paths and who can travel which ones are easy. Your tree has no limits to the number of worlds it can bridge and it can be used to bridge vast distances within a world by its roots dipping in and out of the dimensional soil so to speak.%%%%People who know what the plant is can attack it and try to break the connection of your tree to that dimension but this is incredibly difficult and would take capabilities on par with a mid level deity. The tree itself can supply you with an infinite amount of living wood to shape as needed. Its wood contains powerful protective and restorative energies and is capable of growing any plant or seed brought near.%%%%The tree acts as its own demi-sub-plane that grows larger as it grows and expands into other realms. Initially not being much more expansive than a two storey house, this subspace within and about the tree can grow infinity and could easily be the size of an average city within a few thousand years. You may look out to all its branches and roots in different realms from this subspace.%%%%As long as you are in contact with any part of the tree you are in contact with this subspace and receive its protections and blessings; this tree will survive unharmed by even the entire collapse or intentional destruction of the omniverse, time, space, space-time, fundamental forces, dimension and so forth. If such destruction of the universe or world you are on is imminent or actually occurs, you will be pulled safely and lovingly into your trees subspace, only having to wait out the birth of a new universe/ multiverse/ omniverse which the tree will guarantee happens.%%%%You may bring others to your tree's subspace and afford them these same protections as long as there will be room for them, the tree is able to support any and all life within its subspace unaging, even desperate organisms that require radically different diets and environments will be sustained hardier.%%%%This is an item capstone booster.,,

Warrior - Hamr,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Multiple purchases possible%%%%?A skin, pelt, fur, feathers, bones, or mantles from an animal, any animal you like, beautifully wrote into a garment like a shall, scarf, or drapery. When worn by someone they can take on the form of that animal. You become the animal in full with all its capabilities. The capabilities of yourself and animal form do not enhance or blend (no transfering kryptonian durability to your otter form), unless you are a capstone boosted hamrammr.,,
Warrior - Mjölnir,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Not necessarily the Mjolnir but an indestructible weapon of equivalent power. For comparison, Mjolnir could break or repair anything it contacted, allow the user to freely wield lightning and rain, would always return to its its own, consecrate the earth, could be shrunken down to a pendant size, would grow with its wielder both in power and size (not sure how that makes sense, since it supposedly could break anything) and act as a magic catalyst.

You may determine what benefits within this context it provides as you pour it. You will receive one well made and to your tastes jar every 27 days, enough for 9 people to drink to their heart's content for 9 hours. As this is equally a metaphor you could receive the benefits from just a sip, or poured over someone, if your a god of weather or simply tall enough, just add it to the rain.

Whoever wears this item will instantly appear to have more authority, royalty, charm, charisma, and beauty, to the point you could wear a literal used brown trash bag covered in a dead skunk and baby vomit, and everyone would say that you were the best dressed best smelling person there.%%%%But the real secret of this item is its value. It is priceless with a big T truth. You may give this item as payment for any one thing and it will be accepted no questions asked. You need 1,000,000 million pure human souls, an eternally lost golden lama, and a copy of the unreleased manuscript that doesn't exist yet to get that deal with satan going? This will cover it. Enemy army shows up demanding 100 young men and all your food to spare your land? This will cover. But what's really nifty is that it will always return to you. The more expensive or bigger the purchase, the longer it will take to return, but it will never take more than 9 years to return.,,
Trickster - Gleipnir,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Like the ribbons and chains used to bind Fenrir, you are being given three chains, ribbons, or ropes of binding. These three bindings will accomodate any size you wish can can be used to bind people, objects, things, personified ideas, and cosmic entities, gods, universes, dimensions, and realms, really anything with a "body" can be contained. They are composed of literally impossible things and metaphorical ideas, functionally being as light and strong as needed.%%%%Unlike the originals, these bindings can never be broken or undone by that which is bound, in fact only you can undo these bindings and they are indestructible and impassible in any way. They will completely seal the person from influencing the world in any way if you so desire. They can be as comfortable or as uncomfortable as you desire, short of actual torture, and any time they are used "in bed" they will greatly "enhance" all involved experiences.%%%%You may simply will them to undo themselves so that you can not be trapped by them in any way if you don't want to be.,,
Trickster - Mistilteinn,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A missle or arrow or spear or even sword of some kind made from a simple living wood or plant. It will function perfectly as any kind of mundane projectile bolt, bow, piercing, or slashing weapon, being the perfect version of it in any way by mortal standards.

They carry any and all magics and enchantments superbly well, can be recalled back to their wielder, are impossibly sharp and accurate, both as light as the lightest wood in hand and as hefty as the densest metal.%%%%They are dancing armaments able to act like Andu's arrow, or guard, parry, and protect you as if wielded by a phantom of your own skill level. As they are now full of life, you may sacrifice a weapon to completely heal or raise from the dead one sentient souled being to the way it was before it died or up to an entire forest of life, flora, fana, and all even into its youth.%%%%You may now throw out your weapon into the world and it will travel to any realm your yggdrasil touches to strike down or raise your chosen target, always knowing where to go.

Healer - Gullinbursti,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Multiple purchases possible%%%%?The great golden boar. The ultimate mount, a giant golden boar proportional as a mount to your true size but can shrink as needed for other forms.

It will reflect your divine power and strength, having minor gifts based on your powers and nature, as a god of strength it could break mountains or if a god of wind it could bring forth the scent of far off lands and act as a herald for you. Being in this animal's presence will protect you and anyone you choose from any natural environmental dangers, and I mean any. You could set up camp or swim through an active volcano, outer space, the sun itself and say what a nice cool breeze we are having even if there is no air at all.%%%%It can fly under its own power even without wings, swim, and run even though air and water. It will never tire of fatigue from travel. It is incredibly smart and infinitely loving toward you, while it does have its own personality so you can't force it to like other people, it is obedient to a fault and can never be turned against you magically divinely or otherwise. Does not need food, or air, or sleep, but it can do all those things.%%%%Powers you wield while mounted upon your beast are nine fold more impressive in how they appear and present, but no discernible increase in actual strength. It can not grow sick, be poised, or killed, if it would be it will just vanish. It can be summoned or dismissed from your side instantly and functions like any familiar would. Trained for war and able to fight like an animal of its species. It comes with an equally spectacular chariot if you so like.,,
Healer - Iðunn,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Every moon or 27 days, you will receive an amazingly carved crate of stone or wood, elegantly inlaid and treated (a treasure in its own right) filled with 9 golden fruits of your choice. These fruits will wash away the years and return youth to those who eat from them. Each fruit will restore 9 years of youth, not just in body but in mind and spirit. You will retain your knowledge, wisdom, and joy, but it can carry away the pain, sorrows, hatred, and weariness of the age. These years can be saved up if you do not wish to grow any younger.%%%%The apples can be used to condemn others if you so choose, wiping out all 9 years of memories or any number of memories from within, or forcing a person into youth or unbirth, or condemning a person to a death like sleep for 9 years, with multiple fruits stacking or conditions set as your choice. No matter what though the fruits are the best tasting of their kind that have ever existed even by the standards of gods and can be distilled into heavenly wines, and juices, cakes, and pies each easily able to make or improve such items. A single apple could make a single bottle of wine or pie or 9 or more bottles providing a divisible amount somehow.%%%%If you took the seeds from these (if you want them to have any) you could grow far more normal silver plants of these fruits that hold all the flavor of their divine counterpart growing only where and how you wish them. The cases that you receive could be used to preserve anything that is within, restoring them and maintaining them unaging and unharmed. The cases can hold metaphysical things such as the memories of those you've taken with your fruits or or like pandora's boxes, the evils of the world, or all the anger to be released as you choose.,,
Healer - Ginnungagap,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,An empty land, a place all your own, either within one of the nine realms or close by, connected through the world tree.

It may even be populated by a race like yours, as a mortal of other skin, as an elf of similar stock, or a new tribe of gods equal to the others depending on what you chose to be.%%%%You are free to change the place over time, within your power. You make the laws of this land and can bar entry as you so choose, the people and denizens of this land will never revolt against you or attempt to harm you but they may try to leave and if you kill them all off they won't be able to repopulate. This is a private dimension and like how the asgardians use the bifrost to move from realm to realm you can always open a "bridge" into your realm and return to this home, permanent bridges or paths to and from your realm can be established or destroyed at your leisure.%%%%%%Capstone boosted:%%Not enough I see, you want your own entire cosmology.

Each realm can be its own ever expanding universe like our real world, or a fantasy keep disk upon a turtle's back, or simply a floating city any way you like them. They will be mostly mundane, based on normality within norse myth, but with every jump you visit the realms can freely pick up new features as you desire. If you went to marvel, vibranium, adamantine, and uru would be available within your realms or mythril if you went to a Tolkien setting. Any substances you would purchase from those jumps in the future could be provided to you in endless amounts over time.\%%%%You can not take out anything from your realms into the main jumps that you have created with your nigh-omnipotent gifts within your realms, unless you have your spark. That includes cheating at any part such as just making a bunch of new vibranium bricks appear before you, or even locating the materials in the wild or saying your whole realm is just made of vibranium. As long as you are just using your non-dimension lord powers, perks, gifts, skills, and tools from this or other jumps the items or army you craft and build are fair game to take into the normal universes. Your realms can take on properties not just materials, from new jumps, such as dimensions composed of magic particles, or that are constantly suffusing negative matter, but you can not alter it from how those universes actually behave in their jumps without it being counted as using you nigh-omnipotence within your dimensions.,,

Raising it could protect the world from the full force of the sun, absorbing its power for other uses or scattering it to the winds, able to raise it to the sky and cast shade upon the world.

It has full knowledge of everything anyone has said or done, painted , or crafted, and can tell you all these things, but things fully in the mind are beyond it. It is able to compile information and make inferences and new advice based on that, but it is limited by what people within the world have done. It could not tell you the best way to forge steel, it can tell you the best way to forge steel based on the combined work of all the blacksmiths who have ever lived in this world, meaning it can be wrong, thereby making it the best teacher available in some respects.%%%%It would be able to make reasonable inferences like substituting in a new material never used before based on past information and know properties but it won't necessarily be correct.

In every jump you will get a family that loves you, if for some reason you are barred from having close relatives due to the way the setting works, a drawback, or scenario, you will instead get an extended family that loves you.

If that's not allowed I honestly don't know, well ok, if none of those options work, this item will boost your luck by a substantial amount.%%%%If you would prefer to pass up on the loving family in jump, either due to you ALREADY GETTING ONE, you can, and just take the luck boost. You may take any members of your family as followers but they will be nerfed to a scale of power appropriate to your power in the setting from which they come and what you have purchased.
