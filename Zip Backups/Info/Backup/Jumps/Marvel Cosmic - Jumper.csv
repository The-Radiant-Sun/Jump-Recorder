Universal Drawbacks,,6,,105000,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Human,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Native to Earth, humans are a race of great potential but average ability. They have a very high percentage of supers and if it was not a comic book world this would be highly suspect. There are individual humans scattered through the cosmos whether they were kidnapped or traveled willingly. Rare enough in the depths of space to be worthy of comment but little else. Be careful, it’s a dangerous ‘verse out there.,,
Badoon,,0,,00,,False,,False,,A reptilian species with extreme gender dimorphism and segregation. The males and females live on entirely different planets, the males on Moord rules by Brother Royal and the females on Lotiara ruled by a Queen. They have abilities similar to baseline humans. The males have a star-spanning empire while the females live in primitive captivity back on their homeworld. They have alternatively warred with the Skrulls and the Kree but have also been known to make alliances with the same in certain circumstances.,,
Kree,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Blue (and sometimes pink) skinned humanoid race from the Large Magellanic Cloud. They are technologically advanced and extremely militaristic. Their empire stretches across their entire galaxy. The Kree generally have twice the level of physical capability as baseline humans and are evolutionarily stagnant. They are responsible for the creation of the Inhumans when they attempted research to solve their evolutionary stagnation. This was successful in creating a race of super beings but not so much in solving their problems. Ronan the Accuser and Captain Marvel are some of the most famous of their number. The empire is usually ruled by a hyper advanced AI called the Supreme Intelligence, but has also been ruled by Ronan and the Inhumans at various points. The Kree tend to be arrogant and militaristic with a very law focused honor code.,,
Shi’ar,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Avian descended humanoid race from the planet Chandilar. Technologically advanced and militaristic just like the Kree and often at war with them. The occasional Shiar is born with wings and can fly, but the majority can not. They are about two times as strong as your average human. The Shi’ar Empire rules a million worlds and is very aggressive. They are ruled by an autocratic Majestor/Majestrix who is protected and has their will carried out by a very powerful team of superbeings called the Imperial Guard.,,
Korbinite,,0,,00,,False,,False,,They are a highly advanced and strange looking species responsible for the creation of Beta Ray Bill. They have baseline human capabilities. Their original empire was created through peaceful colonization and they are known for being a friendly race. They were nearly destroyed by Surtur which is what led to their creation of Beta Ray Bill with their advanced sciences. Their technology is impressive considering Beta Ray Bill compares favorably with the Mighty Thor. Beta Ray Bill and by extension what remains of his people have become friends with Thor and the other gods of Asgard.,,
Skrulls,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,A race of green skinned shapeshifters from the Andromeda galaxy. They are a ferocious warrior race and lead the oldest interstellar empire in the universe. The Skrulls have waged war on almost every species in the universe at some point. The most notable thing about them is their ability to shapeshift into anything they can imagine, organic or inorganic. This shapeshifting lets them take on appearance but not the properties or powers and is limited to 1.5 times their volume and mass in either direction. This limitation can be trained to larger values.,,
Flora Colossus,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Flora Colossi are a tree-like species from Planet X. They are governed by the Arbor Masters who use photosynthetic knowledge transmission called Photonic Knowledge to educate the entire species. Due to the efficiency of this process, all Flora Colossus are near geniuses with much knowledge in the sciences. Groot of the Guardians of the Galaxy is the most famous of their number. They are super strong, very durable, and can regenerate as long as there is a twig left. They also have the ability to stretch and reshape their limbs.,,
Inhuman,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,A race that was originally human until they were experimented on by the Kree thousands of years ago. When exposed to the Terrigen Mists they almost always develop powers of various types. They are ruled by the Inhuman Royal Family led by Black Bolt and his wife Medusa. They tend to focus on their own survival and while generally not bad have been known to make aggressive actions to preemptively protect themselves. Since their creation was an attempt by the Kree to end genetic stagnation their genetic code is quite malleable and able to be manipulated to gain more powers or improve other aspects. Those who have been exposed to the Terrigen mists and survived develop a variety of powers. It is up to you if you have been exposed to the mists and if you have developed any powers.,,
Strontian,,0,,-6000,,False,,True,,A humanoid purple skinned race from the Shi’ar Empire, the Strontians possess vast powers beyond most other species in the cosmos. There are only a few left and you are now one of them. So long as your confidence is high, your powers are beyond legendary. At full confidence levels you could easily shatter planets or collapse stars. You can also shoot heat beams from your eyes and possess microscopic vision. You are weak to a specific wavelength of radiation and if your confidence ever drops your powers will plummet until you have regained your confidence. With training you could easily reach the level of Gladiator, Praetor of the Imperial Guard and mightiest of your kind.,,
Eternal,,0,,-6000,,False,,True,,A race of god like beings created by the Celestials. They are each blessed with great powers over the cosmic energy that suffuses the universe. They are at constant war with their genetic mutations called the Deviants. You can alternatively choose to be a Deviant, which is a hideous and twisted mutation of the Eternals.%%%%At base level all Eternals have the ability to channel vast amounts of cosmic energy. This cosmic energy can be used to change their own abilities and increase their physical capabilities, as well as projected and manipulated towards a multitude of effects. Their greatest power is the ability to temporarily merge with others of their kind to form the Uni-Mind, a being of pure light, energy, and will. This form can be used to great effect and can accomplish what single Eternals cannot. After this jump, you can form the Uni-Mind by yourself to temporarily enter an energy form with cosmic manipulation several times more powerful than your base form.%%%%If you are a Deviant, instead of cosmic channeling you get immense powers of shapeshifting and regeneration. Your shape shifting can put Skrulls to shame. However, your base form is very hideous and others are disinclined to trust you if they know what you are. Your base form is only hideous while in this jump. You also get a 300 point bonus stipend for powers.,,
Celestial,,0,,-10000,,True,,True,,Powerful and gigantic extraterrestrial cosmic beings responsible for seeding life throughout the universe. They are responsible for key events in human evolution, including the X-Gene and the creation of the Eternals. The Celestials were created by the first iteration of the Marvel cosmos, the First Firmament. They partook in the great Celestial War that saw the First Firmament seemingly destroyed and led to the creation of the multiverse, setting in motion many events that still effect the Marvel multiverse to this day. They appear to be armor clad humanoids ranging from 2000 to 20000 feet tall though in truth they are biomechanical Hyperspace beings formed of strange matter and cosmic energy. They communicated with others of their kind through instantaneous and limitless ranged quantum telepathy.%%%%Their power is immense and in many ways immeasurable. They transcend conventional space-time which allows them to easily do the seemingly impossible. They collectively shaped the cosmos and created countless beings. Individual celestials can create pocket dimension universes and are considered threats on a universal scale. They have fought and triumphed over beings such as the Phoenix Force and it once took a fully fed Galactus to kill a single Celestial. As one of their kind you are now invested with this might. %%%%You can use the cosmic energy that suffuses you to a massive and various effect. You are a master of cosmic manipulation and it would take an abstract or other being equivalent to a fully fed Galactus or full force Phoenix Force to be a threat to you. In future jumps your 2-20k foot form will be an alt-form.,,
Other,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Any other race I missed or that you want to make up. Point it based on how it compares to the other races with the only limit being nothing above Celestial tier at 1000 points.,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Choose any of these or feel free to start in any location that is not hidden, secret, or locked in the cosmos.%%%%Hala - the homeworld of the Kree and capital of their Empire. This planet is an earthlike world situated in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Gravity a bit higher on this world being the supposed cause for the impressive strength of the Kree.%%%%Skrullos - the homeworld of the Skrulls and capital of their empire. It is deep in the Andromeda Galaxy and is where the Skrulls first evolved. Millions of years ago the shapeshifting Skrulls rose up and destroyed those of their kind who could not change. It is not as developed as Hala of the Kree but is still the capital of an empire that is a grave threat.%%%%Titan - The main moon of Saturn and the technologically advanced home to the Titanian Eternals. This world is the birthplace of the Mad Titan Thanos. It was once a paradise but Thanos in his omnicidal rage nearly destroyed it and killed most of his fellow Eternals. It is now maintained by the remnants of the Titanian Eternals and is a headquarters for those who seek to defend the cosmos from the Mad Titan. Thanos’s father Mentor and brother Eros usually reside here.%%%%Chandilar - The Shi’ar Throneworld and origin of their species. Chandilar is a beautiful and well developed world of 18 billion people deep in the heart of the Shi’ar Galaxy. It functions as their imperial capital and is home to the Majestor and Imperial Guard. It is from this world the Shi’ar rule their million world empire and plan the future of their species.%%%%Kyln - What did you do to get put here? Kyln is the most famous and dangerous hyper prison in the multiverse. It is formed of connected spherical units placed near a space-time barrier called the Crunch. It somehow draws power from the crunch and powers countless neighboring worlds. It is also a highly dangerous and nigh inescapable super prison that houses the most dangerous criminals and warlords in the cosmos. Holding cells here have even been shown to hold powerful Elder Gods. You can be a prisoner, staff, or a visitor.%%%%Earth - The small blue orb and homeworld of humans. A surprisingly important world considering its remoteness and minor relevance. It is home to a bewildering and frankly statistically improbable number of hyper powerful super beings and seems to be at the root of many important universe altering events. Its evolution and development has been manipulated by everyone from the Celestials to Galactus and it has been destroyed more times than I can count. It is home though and even after all this time maybe you still have a soft spot for it.,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,There are countless mysteries in the Marvel cosmos. These are not just events and objects but also people. There are countless individuals with no or mysterious background, some who just appeared, others created without memories. You are one such individual. Being a surprise or mystery to the universe has its benefits. This defaults with no memories or existing background in the marvel universe. Any other origin can be used as a Drop In in terms of not forcing backgrounds and memories onto you.,,
Tyrant,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Mad Titan Thanos, Blastaar, Annihilus, Tyrant; all names that strike fear and terror into countless billions. Not for a Tyrant the dreams of a common villain these beings have a vision of domination of scales extending all the way to ultimate cosmic control. Sometimes neutral rivals but never friends they all seek to control all and destroy what they cannot have. You have joined their feared number as a tyrant of moderate renown. They know you as a potential rival but someone perhaps worthy of grudging respect and perhaps worth talking to when they need an alliance of convenience against the do-gooders that would deny their vision.,,
Scientist,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Tony Stark, Reed Richards, The High Evolutionary, these are just a few of the names recognized for their amazing scientific and technical knowledge. Just a single one of these men and women is capable of changing the lives of entire worlds of people and the direction of the cosmos. Scientists and engineers of Marvel have saved and destroyed the cosmos on numerous occasions depending on their goals and expertise. You are a well known scientist if not one of similar capabilities to those listed. The other famous scientists of Marvel are inclined to contact you if they have questions regarding your area of expertise and depending on if you are known for being a hero or villain you might be reached to help further some good or evil goal for some tyrant or protector.,,
Protector,,0,,00,,False,,False,,There are those who make it their goal to protect their worlds or even the entire universe. There are those who are chosen to have this duty hoisted upon them by forces beyond their understanding. Regardless of their origins many of them spend their lives living up to the ideal of protecting all that is good and all that they care about. Such names as Captain Marvel, Quasar, the Nova Corps, the Spaceknights are all known for the good they do for as many as they can. You are a protector. Whether you just decided one day to save and protect or were chosen by something beyond you strive to live to this ideal. You are famous enough that your average world has at least heard your name as someone who tries to do good and helps when the chips are down. Good luck, it is a dangerous cosmos out there.,,
Freelancer,,0,,00,,False,,False,,There are a lot of heroic and villainous teams and organizations out there. A lot of people who align themselves with this faction or that and make a specific stand for some organization or another. And then there are freelancers. These are individuals and small teams that serve no overarching organization or ideal save perhaps that of being a good person and helping where they can (like various renditions of the Guardian of the Galaxy) to those who simply want to profit how they want as pirates or criminals all the way to those individuals who just want to be left alone and who have spent so long surviving on their own that they have developed very useful skills and expertise. You are now a freelancer, a free agent dedicated to whatever you like. People in the galaxy know you as a wild card and a loose cannon. Whether they fear you or like you depends on the sort of freelancer you are. Star Lord, space pirate, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and various other criminal organizations and mercenaries fall under this umbrella.,,
Drop In - Mystery Wrapped in Enigma,,1,,-1000,,False,,False,,A lot of people are open books and can be easily read. Their motives are very transparent, especially in a universe where casual mind reading and precognition are dime a dozen abilities. This means a lot of mystery can be lost when joe schmoe can tell everyone who you are, what you think, and what you are going to do. However, none of this applies to you any longer. You are a hard person to read and incredibly difficult to predict. Your motives and behavior are nearly impossible to decipher except through dedicated attempts by those with the right abilities. As an added bonus, you have a mysterious air that intrigues those around you. People always dig the mysterious stranger.,,
Drop In - Strong Mind,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Marvel Multiverse is a dangerous place. The cosmic side of things is even more dangerous. There are deadly threats around most corners, threats both physical and mental. With this perk, your mental side is more protected from said danger. It is very difficult to control or corrupt you. Your resistance to mind control, telepathy, and things of that nature is through the roof. Much like the previous perk, dedicated psychics or similar entities can negate this given enough time. This also serves as a minor willpower boost.,,
Drop In - On the Side of Angels...or Not,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It can be hard to tell who is on what side, and it can change so often that people start to lose trust or just assume someone is on opposing sides. For some reason there is something about you that causes people to believe you are on the side you say you are and will trust you the same as they would an iconic member of said group. This effect dissipates if you are caught acting against the interests of said group or organization. People get a general sense that you are someone trustworthy.,,
Drop In - Insights on Inner Self,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Whoever said know thyself must have been thinking of you. Let others lie to themselves or know doubt about who they truly are. Let the rest struggle against their base instincts. You have a complete and total understanding of yourself. You know your true motivations and psychology down to the deepest core of your being. You can even decide to change things about your psyche over time. In addition, no one can ever make you doubt yourself for any reason.,,
Drop In - Beyond the Cosmic Norm,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Well aren’t you a special little snowflake? A lot of people think they are one of a kind. Most of them are wrong. You are not. You are a truly unique being in the cosmos. You can not be copied, replaced, cloned, or duplicated in any manner unless you allow it. Even holograms and illusions of you stick out as obvious mimics no matter how perfect they might otherwise be. The universe has noticed your uniqueness and occasionally sends you helpful glimpses of things you should not know or be aware of.,,
Drop In - Alien Concepts and Mind Boggling Experiences,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Cosmic side of Marvel is full of eldritch truths and sanity bending knowledge. Ancient things wait in the stars and even abstract concepts such as Death and Eternity are sentient beings in this place. You are well equipped to handle esoteric truth and memetic hazards. Crazy conceptual and mind boggling geometry does not throw you off, and you can come to understand concepts that should otherwise addle your primitive mind. Exposure to psychedelic or mind bending experiences will not drive you mad. Extended and high level exposure will eventually break this protection.,,
Drop In - The Ultimate Outsider,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are the ultimate outsider. The universe does not recognize you as part of it and thus many things that might otherwise affect people on a universal scale just ignore you. Universal threats that affect all living creatures, viruses that target all members of a certain species, and anything with a generic large scale target has no effect on you. Things that rely on chance to choose their targets, a particular finger snap for example, will always fail to pick you.,,
Drop In - Astral Constant,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Some things just are. Some people call these things facts, those in the know tend to call them Astral Constants. Adam Warlock was once considered such a thing. You are now one as well. As an Astral Constant you are invulnerable to metaphysical destruction, a being that shouts I Am to a careless universe and is heard as such. Reality warps and cosmic undoing now simply slide off of you. You cannot be erased or undone save on the physical plane. If someone wants you out of the picture, even a nigh all powerful God, they will have to come down and do it the old fashioned way.,,
Tyrant - Plans within Plans,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Every evil overlord needs a good plan. Without plans how can you conquer the stars or bend the universe to your will? You are a master of planning. Complicated gambits with hundreds of moving parts can be flawlessly executed by you without even trying. The galaxy is your chessboard and you are a master. Labyrinthine plots spring nearly fully formed in your mind.,,
Tyrant - Master of Deceit,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The truth is for those without the will to power. The truth is what you decide it is. The truth does not matter unless you say so. The truth is yours to mold. Falsehoods are merely another tool in your mighty arsenal. You are very skilled in crafting convincing lies and people are inclined to believe even outlandish claims. If you get caught lying this will no longer work on those who caught you.,,
Tyrant - Mystic Study,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,There are many paths to power and the path of the mystic arts is an alluring one. It is also very dangerous to both its practitioners and victims. You have begun down a path trod by some of the most powerful entities in the cosmos. You are not yet the match of those such as Dr. Strange but you know dozens of spells, can identify the most famous mystics, and are familiar with dozens of grimoires and artifacts. You instinctively know where to find new sources of mystic knowledge and power and learn new magical skills much faster than others.,,
Tyrant - Dark Sciences,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Science is a tool like any other but oh how useful of a tool it is. However you rule, however you carry out your conquests, your might is made only mightier by the strength of your dark sciences. You know how to unleash the most destructive aspects of any science or technology you understand. You know how to turn any of your knowledge to evil or destruction. Are you a master of the healing sciences? Well now you know how to create terrible viruses and cancers. Are you a mechanical engineer? The universe has never seen such dastardly torture devices. Every last piece of knowledge you have can be tuned for maximum destruction.,,
Tyrant - Sacred Mission,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are on a mission. You have always been on a mission. You may be a tyrant but you are a tyrant with a goal. Why else would you be here if not to carry out your dreams? Conquest, power, knowledge, peace, whatever drives you gives you an unparalleled strength of will. You can persevere through the greatest adversity and never give up so long as you are moving along in your mission. You will find that even the grandest of odds arrayed against you do not seem so mighty against the will of your ideals. This extends to those who ally and serve you so long as they believe in your quest. Any you can convince of the truth of your goals will also receive this benefit.,,
Tyrant - Power of Faith,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Faith is a grand power all its own. It can move mountains, it can rewrite laws, it can...power lasers? Much like a certain Universal Church of Truth you have discovered how to use faith as a power source. Any faith towards an ideal, religion, or philosophy you or others have can be turned into a potent fuel source. This fuel can be harnessed in generators, engines, and other devices that you know how to build and be used to power ships, mind control devices, planet busting weapons, really it can be used like any other fuel source. More powerful uses of faith require exponentially more faith with diminishing returns. The faith of thousands could power a starship, but it would take the faith of millions if not billions to power a planet busting laser.,,
Tyrant - Head of the Table,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are in charge and everyone knows it. You might sometimes work with others and ostensibly be on a “team” with equals but you know you are superior and, frankly, so do they. Any groups you join or form will tend to look to you for leadership, at worst viewing you as a first among equals if the power disparity is low. If you are more powerful than them they will view you as their absolute leader and do nothing without your orders. Even entities far above you who deign to join a team with you would automatically assume you are serving in some kind of leadership capacity.,,
Tyrant - Seasoned and Powerful,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You’ve been around the block. You have decades if not centuries of experience in exerting your will across the multiverse. All of your abilities are at the level of someone with decades of experience in that ability. You also have a complete and total knowledge and understanding of your capabilities and how to leverage them to their maximum capacity, especially when using them in tandem. You know how to use any allies or minions to their fullest and tend to know the capabilities of all of your enemies. As an added bonus, every person knows your name as one they should be afraid of if you so choose.,,
Scientist - Shades of Grey,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Sometimes extreme measures are called for when the stakes are high enough. Some experiments must be done no matter how egregious they might be. Morals can easily get in the way of good science and halt useful progress. Even the most objective individual can get squeamish when working against their usual moral compass. While this perk does not change said moral compass, it does allow you to look at everything through a practical and objective lens. You can accurately measure the moral and ethical cost of achieving your goals and determine if the moral transgression is worth it. This prevents those pesky emotions from getting in the way of good science.,,
Scientist - I Know Things,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,What use is genius if no one will listen? How can one save the day or take over the galaxy if they are ignored? This ensures that will never be a problem for you. You know things and people know that. They will no longer scoff at or ignore your scientific ramblings so long as you know what you are talking about. You can always convince people to accept facts so long as you can explain them. People will also accept your knowledge of things as equivalent to a physical item of equal value when discussing bartering or trading. You can’t bullshit with this perk. You have to actually be right and know the thing for it to be taken seriously.,,
Scientist - The Mystic and the Machine,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The argument between mystics and technology is a faulty one. There is no need to choose one as they enhance and complement one another. Like a certain Mad Titan you have unlocked mastery of combining these two pathways to power. You can always find ways to combine any mystical knowledge you have with any scientific or technical knowledge. This differs from Fine Line in that it is all about creating magitech. It also allows you to make a technological version of any magic you know, or a magical version of any technology you can build. All power sources between the two become cross compatible as well. Only fools choose one when they can have both.,,
Scientist - Biotech,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,There are many fields of scientific and engineering expertise. They are all studied and mastered by assorted scientists across the universe. One of the most versatile and powerful fields is that of biotechnology. You are a veritable god in this field. Force evolve creatures at your whim, uplift entirely new species just because. Feel free to create biological interfaces with mechanical devices. The sky's the limit and flesh is your servant.,,
Scientist - Fine Line between Reality and Illusion,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The separation of reality from illusion is only so many words. Your scientific research has unlocked the mysteries and secrets of both. You can create technology that interfaces with both reality and illusion and can easily turn illusions into real objects and make real objects illusory. You can create fully realistic illusions that might as well be reality. You can create machines that simply wave away any mystic’s illusions no matter how skilled they might be. Reality is what you and your machines say it is. The limits to this ability is your technological prowess and understanding of a particular setting’s illusory magics/psionics/what have you. This perk gives you a very high baseline for manipulation. You also have a deep innate sense for what is reality and what is illusion and can always tell the difference.,,
Scientist - Genius Intellect,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,This is a big universe with many individuals of stunning intellect, towering geniuses that leave others in the dirt when it comes to their brilliant minds. In Marvel, it behooves a scientist to possess otherworldly genius as it seems to be so damn common. If you are of regular Earth intelligence good luck ever doing anything worthwhile. Fortunately for you, you have this perk. Your intelligence has been raised to frankly insane levels. You are closer to being a peer of such a great mind as Reed Richard and the High Evolutionary than anyone has the right to be, though their intellect is still ahead of yours.,,
Scientist - Absolute Scientific Mastery,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Here is the apex of your craft. Scoff at the petty inventions even the likes of Galactus and High Evolutionary can create. The Maker’s Tools? Ha, child’s play. If it is scientifically possible to create it, you can figure it out. If your research or invention would require some undiscovered theory or law then you can work through that and perhaps even create new fields of study. The only limit to this perk is it must be something that is scientifically possible either within a setting or through perk fiat. You always know if something is scientifically possible no matter what setting or world you are in.,,
Scientist - Beyond?...Beyond What?,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,The Beyonders are one of the most dangerous threats the cosmos has ever seen. They are capable of wiping out even abstract concepts and multiversal entities. They once came dangerously close to destroying the entire Marvel Multiverse just so see what would happen, until Doctor Doom saved the day. The Beyonder has been revealed to be a baby version of one of them, and Molecule Man was part of their experiment to destroy the multiverse. Their capabilities might be technological or natural , but either way you now possess the ability to carry out their deadliest capability. You are capable of building devices and unleashing technology that can affect things on a metaphysical or abstract level. Given enough time and resources you could make a device to destroy the anthropomorphization of Death itself. No matter what you can figure out how to use and develop technologies that affect the metaphysical and unnatural. The more powerful the entity or concept you want to affect the more difficult and time consuming it will be in both resources and development. It might take you eons but isn’t it worth it. This perk also makes sure you know how to create replacements for any concepts you might destroy or otherwise imprison. Unless you just want to destroy the cosmos, that really is not my problem.,,
Protector - Verbal Psychology,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,There are many ways to do your duty and not all protecting requires a fist. You know how to talk your way out of (or into) dangerous situations, or really situations of any kind. You can manipulate people with the right words but only towards good ends. Talk a villain into releasing a hostage, not jumping into a star.,,
Protector - Anywhere there is Trouble,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have a knack and a sense for trouble. A tingle down your spine when something bad is happening. This gives you a general sense of the severity and direction of the trouble. This does not give you a way to get there, though interestingly enough you tend to find that you are already where the trouble started. Funny that.,,
Protector - A Just Judge,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Impartial judges are hard to find. The closest this place seems to have are the likes of Ronan the Accuser, who to call biased would be an understatement, and the Living Tribunal, who is more focused on judging much larger scale issues. This has changed with your arrival. You are viewed, even by your enemies, as an impartial and righteous judge. As long as you are actually impartial and rule fairly, those who come to you will accept your rulings to the best of their ability. People across the cosmos know your name as one of fairness and justice.,,
Protector - In Defense of Innocence,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You know the protection of the innocent is the most important task of a hero. Everything else is secondary and done as part of fulfilling this first and most noble of goals. With this park, you’ll find all your abilities double when you are protecting innocent people. This also makes you luckier and gives you a limited form of plot armor as long as you are protecting the innocent of some sort, whether that means unarmed civilians or wrongfully accused individuals.,,
Protector - Natural Born Leader,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Leadership is as much an innate talent as a skill to be mastered. You have all the innate talent and decades of leadership experience that anyone could ask for. You know how to get even completely dysfunctional teams to work together quite seamlessly. You always know the right words to say and correct actions to take to increase morale and inspire those who follow you. You are also a master of delegation, knowing exactly who to assign to what tasks and knowing anyone you delegate to will get the job done.,,
Protector - Bravest Soul, Biggest Fool,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It has been said that foolhardiness and bravery are the same thing. That only an idiot would stand before insurmountable odds for such paltry and ephemeral things as justice and hope. Much like a certain Quasar, you are both brave and foolish. Those supposedly paltry concepts are everything to you and you would happily stand before the marching infinite abyss to uphold such ideals. When standing up to insurmountable odds you willpower and morale sky rockets. The more insurmountable the odds, the greater your power will rise. This will not work if the odds are near or in your favor. So long as you are doing something foolish for the right reasons, there is no such thing as impossible.,,
Protector - The Ultimate Sacrifice,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Sometimes victory requires great sacrifice. Sometimes it even requires a life. It would be a pity for such sacrifices to be in vain. Whether sacrificing your life, your health, or even more conceptual things you find your sacrifices always work in some way. The degree to which they work is equivalent to their relative worth and cost. Truly massive problems and dangers will require equivalently severe sacrifices such as your life, or the life of someone on your team, but it will never be for naught.,,
Protector - Cosmic Cleanup Man,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,It’s a dirty job but somebody's gotta do it. The Marvel Universe is a mess especially on the cosmic scale. Between sentient, angry multiverses, insane purple dudes with stones who have a death fetish, and a certain firebird who is determined for the universe to not stagnate, things are an absolute mess. Even powerful cosmic entities have trouble with these things. This is where you come in. Beings of great power tend to view you as a way to clean up messes and will entrust you with the tools and aid to clean shit up. As long as you are helping fix things in the cosmos, these beings will provide various benefits depending on who/what they are. This also gives you a weak awareness of any universe shattering events that might be in the works as well as a location of the cause. This awareness differs from the earlier Anywhere there is trouble perk in that it tends to warn ahead of time before said events occur, and then only for the big ones.,,
Freelancer - Cute Space Boy,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It’s a stupid nickname but boy is it handy. Star Lord now has competition on the charisma front. People always find you charming if you are a smug little prick, maybe even especially because you are a smug little prick. You are considered attractive enough that even people who are not into your gender or species will find themselves distracted by your looks and effortless charm.,,
Freelancer - This is a Great Hideout,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,It might be a shack to everyone else but the local Accuser still hasn’t found it. You have a unique eye for finding buildings, abandoned or otherwise, that can be used for a solid hideout. Once established, it would take screwing up or dedicated searchers weeks to find the hideout, and that is assuming they even know there is “a” hideout. This is a way to lay low until the heat blows over. Once discovered, a particular hideout can never benefit from this again.,,
Freelancer - I Know the Way,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Any “legitimate businessman” worth his salt should know how to find what he needs, or where his next big job should be, or where to pawn this highly illegal artifact. You know every fence on this side of the universe, every big mover that matters, and places that you should not even know exist. If you don’t know where something is or how to find it, you know someone who does. This also includes an amazing sense of direction. You always know exactly where in the universe you are.,,
Freelancer - Let’s Get Outta Here,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Every good criminal, I mean freelancer, needs a good escape plan. You are better than most at finding out how to get the hell outta dodge and take your friends with you. You are a bane to prison wardens across the galaxy and villains have a lot of trouble restraining you. For most things less than being trapped in a seamless metal box, you will eventually find a way out.,,
Freelancer - Freelance Combat Advisor,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Tactics and strategy are your bread and butter. From small unit maneuvers to planetary assault, you understand everything from troop movements to logistics. Woe be unto the force that underestimate what you and a small army of guerillas could pull off, let alone a professional army. People in charge regularly seek you out to serve as their military advisor. This ability is maximized for asymmetrical and guerrilla warfare,,
Freelancer - I am a Space Pirate,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You know if anyone else walked into Knowhere and announced that they were the Dread Pirate Jumper, they would at best get laughed out of the place. However, you are completely serious and everyone knows it. You can announce yourself as a mighty space pirate and people will know you as a fierce and worthy foe who lives up to their name. You have dozens of years of experience in space piracy (and the normal kind too) and know how to attract the perfect crew no matter the job. Law enforcement is wary of your prowess and the average citizen will either fear or adore you depending on the sort of pirate you are. You can choose any other type of criminal to be but whatever you choose is locked in for the current jump. This comes with all the skills needed to be the best criminal in the universe.,,
Freelancer - Jury Rig,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Everyone has to rough it sometimes and not everybody has access to a lot of resources. You know how to make do though. You can take a hunk of junk that has not flown in years and get it cruising the star lanes with junkyard parts. As long as something can theoretically be fixed, you can fix it with any part as long as it resembles the correct material. The lower grade the part and the more severe the repair, the longer it will take. How the hell did you get your starship running with a paper towel roll and a paperclip?,,
Freelancer - Lucky,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,For others, luck is just a word. For you, luck is the key to your lifestyle. You are one of the luckiest people in the universe. Things just tend to go your way even when you screw things up. Even bad situations tend to somehow work out in your favor in the long run. You will still get hurt and fail at times, but these situations won’t be impossible to get past. You sometimes get strong bursts of extraordinary luck. Did Thanos just drop an Infinity Stone right and front of you and not even notice?,,
Monk of the Kaluba Sect,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,A sect of the Shao-Lom monks on titan teach intense meditation techniques and high level martial arts. Like Heather Douglas the Moondragon, you spent years being trained by the monks while living with them. You are a martial artist peer to any master on earth and know meditation techniques to speed up your healing and other mystical effects.,,
Self Improvement,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You know what it will take to improve any aspect of yourself and can always find a way to improve something. This is an important ability to have in such a dangerous place as the Marvel cosmos.,,
Supremely Skilled,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,There is something about being so good in a particular skill that everyone in the universe would be in awe at what you can pull off. There are many throughout the verse that have skills that are spoken of like myth and legend. You are now one of them. Pick a mundane skill and you are now in the top 10% of the universe in that skill.,,
Obscure Law,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It is a big multiverse and there are a lot of laws out there. Whether through studying with the Accuser Corps on Kree or just being a very interested amateur you know just about every random obscure law out there and can usually find one that applies to a given situation. Even better, most of the time at least half the people involved in whatever caused you to invoke the law will be inclined to at least hear you out.,,
Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Accuser Corps is the justice system of the Kree Empire. They are Judge, Jury, and Executioner and above them all sits the Supreme Accuser. Like Ronan you are able to invoke the laws of the land with supreme authority. Most will stand down when you tell them to and accept your rulings and for those who will not, beat them physically and they will accept your authority.,,
Protector of the Universe,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Throughout the ages a being known as Eon has appointed and empowered individuals to be the Protector of the Universe. As a Protector one is granted a great Cosmic Awareness that allows them to know whatever they need to know at that exact moment to save the day. You have been chosen as a Protector and granted this Cosmic Awareness. In this jump and ones after it, people will automatically see you as someone who is there to help and who they can call to save the world, galaxy, or universe and greater beings of good and protection will be inclined to aid you as they can.,,
Elder of the Universe,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Elders of the Universe are immortal beings and the last of each of their species. They have existed for billions of years since not too long after the Big Bang. They possess the Power Primordial which is the essence of the energy released during the big bang. This gives them great powers similar in nature to the Power Cosmic but not on the same scale as Galactus. You are now one of their number. Each one has chosen an obsession over the years whether it is Games like the Grandmaster, or collecting everything like the Collector. Feel free to pick an obsession and theme your abilities and personality around it.,,
Herald of Galactus,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You are a Herald of Galactus, empowered by Galactus with vast amounts of the Power Cosmic to travel the cosmos and help him sate his hunger. Or you would have to do this if he had not sort of forgotten about you. Feel free to not feed the big guy while you are here without fear of him removing your abilities. The Power Cosmic gives you an amazing ability to channel nigh limitless amounts of cosmic energy for just about any purpose. Energy blasts, transmutation, energy absorption, super strength, the Power Cosmic can do just about anything limited only by your stamina and ability to channel it. In future jumps, greater beings are willing to accept you as a servant and give you things to help serve them even if they otherwise would not do such a thing.,,
Cosmic Entity,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,While not a fully formed abstraction or manifestation you are a powerful cosmic entity with powerful cosmic abilities, immortality, and are accepted as a cosmic entity and welcome to join when the other heavy hitter entities meet. Entities like Galactus and Eternity will view you as a peer even if you are significantly weaker.,,
The House Where I Live,,1,,-10000,,False,,True,,The Phoenix Force is the embodiment of all life and psionic energy in the cosmos. The Phoenix Force desires only that life grows and evolves and is willing to destroy entire star systems if she feels they are stagnant. Over the eons they have chosen many a host to enforce their will, though none were ever as close to the Phoenix as one Jean Grey, who was able to nearly merge and channel all of the Phoenix’s powers. The Phoenix Force views you as an ideal host that compares to Jean and has taken residence within you. In the future, any beings that need special hosts will view you as a proper one and there will be no compatibility issues. This also protects you from being controlled by said beings though they can still influence your emotions. You will never lose the Phoenix Force and when you leave this jump you can decide if it is the original that leaves with you or a duplicate.,,
Import,,3,,-1000,,False,,False,,Import or create a companion. Can be bought multiple times, they get 800 points to spend,,
Canon,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Take along anyone short of an Abstract that you can convince to join you.,,
Luxurious Hair,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Like Medusa, Queen of the Inhumans, you possess extremely long hair and the psychokinetic ability to control it down to the individual strand. Your hair is 6 feet long but can stretch to triple that at a pinch. Your hair as a whole is capable of lifting around 2 tons and this can be increased through training. You can snap it faster than the speed of sound or even make it harden and be as sharp as sharpened steel should you choose to use it offensively. The hair can also perform delicate actions like picking locks and typing. You can feel sensations from any hair if you choose as a mental feedback but do not feel pain through it.,,
Elemental Goddess,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Crystal of the Attilan Royal Family of Inhumans has the psionic ability to interact with the four elements fire, earth, air, and water on an atomic level. This is an ability the two of you now share. You can easily control air within a 30 mile radius, control earth in such a way to cause a 6.7 earthquake, hydrokinesis to flawlessly control and manipulate thousands of gallons of water, even enough to trap Namor the Submariner, and pyrokinesis to set entire city blocks alight.,,
Good Dog,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Lockjaw is the goodest of boys and has saved his Inhuman family on numerous occasions. You, like him, are able to teleport as far as the distance between the Earth and the Moon without error and take up to a dozen or so people near you. You can also open pathways to other dimensions.,,
Nightmask,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Adam was a man built by the strange alien Ex Nihilo to be the perfect being. Now called Nightmask, he is not what his creator intended but possesses many strange and unusual, but powerful abilities. It would seem that Ex Nihilo has created a second Nightmask. You are able to control and communicate with machinery as if it were sentient, as well as radically alter said machines. Your primary power is to create blue energy halos that can be used as portals, shields, and energy blasts.,,
The Abyss,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You are a sister being to Ex Nihilo. You are able to take a gaseous form that makes you immune to physical harm. You are also highly suggestive and able to implant ideas into others minds though this can be resisted. Finally, you are able to read the essence of those around you and tell everything about their biology and origin.,,
The Earth Bends to My Will,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have the psionic ability to manipulate the molecules of rock and earth to move planetary masses up to 100 miles in diameter. You can move asteroids of 10 miles in diameter at speeds of up to thousands of miles per hour. You can control the direction of a swarm of meteors within 100 miles of his person. Through concentration, you could potentially affect a small piece of matter 1000 miles away from him. While standing on Earth, you could affect tectonic plates sufficiently to cause earthquakes and create chasms on the surface thousands of feet deep or wide. If you were to use your powers to their fullest, you could separate Manhattan island levitate it miles into the sky.,,
Starhawk,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Empowered by the Hawk God of Arcturus you are capable of manipulating light and dark to create blasts of energy and solid light or dark constructs. Being empowered by the Hawk God also gives you superhuman physical capability, especially agility and reflexes.,,
Moondragon,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Through years of intense training and the unlocking of your natural abilities, you have become a telepath of incredible skill and talent. You are capable of powerful mental attacks, mentally controlling even the strong willed over large distances, memory modification, and even communicating with others across star systems. This psionic ability will increase through training and practice.,,
Ex Nihilo,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Builders are a supremely advanced race of alien beings who have created entities known as the Gardeners to seed specific kinds of life across the universe for unknown reasons. Ex Nihilo is one such Gardener and after a series of misunderstandings ended up working against the Builders and with the Avengers. You are a wellspring of life like the Gardener known as Ex Nihilo. You are capable of controlling organic life, transforming it as you desire by either touch or with programmed viruses and things you call origin bombs which can remap genetic codes within ten miles of where they impact. DNA is your clay and you can mold it as you please. This comes with an innate knowledge of superior levels of biology.,,
The Deadliest Woman in the Universe,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Like Gamora, you have been modified and trained extensively to be one of the most dangerous fighters in the universe. While your physical enhancements do not put you into the range of the heavy hitters it is your skill and training that allow you to punch far above your weight. You are familiar with more than 84% of all fighting techniques in the universe and know precisely how to apply your combat skills when fighting things physically superior to you. You are an expert in all weapons and a highly skilled assassin. You might not be able to take a direct hit from Ronan’s universal weapon but if he misses and you get in close you could easily make it a bad day for the law man. This comes with the additional benefit that people will now automatically know you as “The Most Dangerous Jumper in the Universe”.,,
The Star Brand,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,A strange explosive event known as a White Event, that may or may not have killed everyone around you, has blessed you with the powers of the Star Brand. Possessing the Star Brand marks you as a protector of worlds. You have superhuman strength and nigh invulnerability, you can fly at FTL outside of an atmosphere and faster than sound in one. You can manipulate matter and energy at a quantum level and discharge powerful energy blasts that at their absolute maximum can shatter planets. When enraged you can temporarily assume a form of pure cosmic energy that enhances your abilities. You also have a cosmic awareness that can give you a general sense of when people are producing irregularities on a cosmic scale.,,
Dynamokinesis,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,While the source of your ability is not required to be the X-Gene, you possess the same powers of one Gabriel Summers, or Emperor Vulcan as he prefers. You have the abilities to absorb and manipulate any form of energy at an Omega mutant level. Enough energy can overload you but the amount required to do that is utterly immense. You can use the absorbed energy to redirect into blasts, create solid energy constructs, and you can also convert it to any other type of energy you are familiar with. Since your power has its root in psionic abilities you can use your powers to temporarily suppress other people’s connections to their own so long as their powers are mental in nature. You can siphon energy not just from your surroundings or inanimate objects but also from other people and superhumans. Your current maximum of energy absorption easily makes you a planetary threat.,,
Voice of the King,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Whether or not you gained this ability through the Terrigen Mists you now share the mighty powers of King Blackagar Boltagon, supreme ruler of the Inhumans. Your voice naturally harnesses electrons and ambient particles through the speech center of your brain. Somehow this gives you the ability to fly and use your voice to manipulate energy and matter but none of that is what you are truly famous for. Your voice possesses immense destructive capabilities. A whisper from you could shatter a man’s bones, a normal speaking voice could raze cities, and a truly loud shout could break continents. Unlike the true Black Bolt, you can toggle this on and off if you would like to carry on a normal conversation without destroying everything around you.,,
Spectrum,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,After being bombarded by an exotic energy of extra dimensional particles, you gained the ability to turn yourself into any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum. You gain all properties of an energy form you are transformed into but can only transform into one energy form at a time. It only takes you a fraction of a second to switch between different forms. You have the general suite of super strength, flight, and super speed. You can go intangible or invisible depending on the type of energy you are currently transformed into. You can absorb and redirect energy as long as it is the right type and new energy forms can be unlocked after study and analysis.,,
Captain Universe,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Uni-Power, which may or may not be the sentience of the universe, has chosen you as a host. The Uni-Power gives you access to Uni-Vision which functions as cosmic awareness, can force people to tell you the truth, and grants you microscopic, xray, and telescopic vision down to the subatomic level. You are also capable of transmuting matter and energy.,,
Quantum Magic,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,A unique being like a certain Adam Warlock, you are capable of great feats of physical might and the manipulation of vast amounts of energy. You can also manipulate energy on a quantum level to do seemingly magical effects. You can cast Quantum Spells on an immense scale that let you carry out truly impressive feats on a cosmic scale.,,
The Master of Antimatter,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have become an antimatter reactor and generator. One gram of anti-matter contains the same energy as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, one droplet could power New York City for an entire day, and now your entire body is dedicated to the production and use of anti-matter. At its very base this gives you strength to compare to the likes of the Hulk and Sentry but the power only starts there. You are nigh invulnerable as long as you can continue to channel your antimatter energies. You can fly. You also have complete control over anti-matter and can use it for energy blasts or even incredible levels of energy and matter manipulation.,,
Possessor of Cosmic Power,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Tyrant was an immensely powerful being created by Galactus and at the height of his power even threatened the world eater. You now possess the ability to channel immense amounts of cosmic energy through the ambient fields created by the life forces of others. At your height, when able to siphon energy from superhumans you could threaten even Galactus, but unless you conquer entire worlds and enslave many supers this power level is beyond your reach. As it stands you are a threat to any Herald of Galactus and are not limited by the Power Cosmic.,,
Simply Mar-vellous,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,I think you know where this is going. Whether or not it was through Kree experiments you possess the same powers as Captain Marvel. You can manipulate matter and energy, I am sensing a pattern here in Marvel Cosmic, and possess truly staggering strength and durability. You can fire photonic blasts, absorb energy, create energy constructs, and you can even temporarily channel the full might of a White Hole and enter a form like Binary where your cosmic powers are magnified to an even greater degree. The more you practice and use it, the longer you can enter your Binary form.,,
Hyperion,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,There have been many men from many universes who have been called Hyperion. They have their differences but share many similarities in powers. You are now yet another Hyperion, a powerful Eternal that compares favorably to Hulk, Thor, and Sentry. You have superhuman strength, durability, speed, and flight. You have amazing visual capabilities including the ability to see strands of DNA while in orbit, see anything on the electromagnetic spectrum, and see down to the microscopic level at incredible ranges. No Superman expy would be complete without powerful heat vision enough to melt cities though yours is called “Atomic Vision”. You can channel cosmic energy like any other Eternal. Your mind is a photonic linear array allowing you to process your thoughts at light speed, recall any memory instantly, and give you a genius level intellect.,,
Items,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Any item of a similar type can be imported as any of these.%%%%Any purchase of an infinity stone comes with a free duplicate of the Infinity Gauntlet. You can only get one Infinity Gauntlet this way. Steal the one from Thanos if you want another.,,
Costume,,2,,00,,False,,True,,These are comics after all. Pick any style you’d like. It is immune to your powers and tends to only get ripped and destroyed in dramatic and cool looking ways. It provides no defense but a new identical set will show up in your warehouse the next day if destroyed.,,
Memory Chip,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A small but handy cybernetic implant. 100% total recall of everything you have ever experienced and records everything even if you aren't consciously processing it. Can just be attached to your head somewhere if you don't want it implanted in you.,,
Jumper Bands,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Marvel likes its nifty wristbands. You have your own set of cool Bands of Jumper that are any style you like. You can import a single item with each purchase to give a band form they can transform in and out of.,,
Raptor Armor,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Ancient Shi’ar robot suits that roost within the Tree of Shadows in Null Space. You now possess an amulet that allows you to summon a Raptor suit. While summoned your body is placed in the Tree and you can troll the robotic suit. It has the powers to fly supersonic in atmosphere and nearly luminal outside of atmosphere. It increases your strength, speed, and durability. You can fire various blasts and have access to several other pseudo mystical abilities. The coolest part of the armor is the razor sharp metallic wings.,,
Flying Fortress,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,This is a gigantic well armed and armoured battlecruiser. Easily the size of a city, it is outfitted with advanced FTL drives and cutting edge technology. It makes a great base of operations for a warlord or space pirate. It will retain any changes you make to it and has an either living or AI (your choice) for a crew to pilot and maintain it for you.,,
Stormbreaker,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Stormbreaker is an enchanted axe made from Uru. It was crafted by the Dwarves for Beta Ray Bill after his fight with Thor.

It always returns to you when thrown, can only be lifted by you or those you deem worthy, can project energy blasts and even amplify your own energy capabilities.,,
Nega Bands,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A copy of the bands created by the Kree, themselves a copy of the Quantum Bands. These bands greatly increase your physical strength, allow you to fly through the void of space, absorb and manipulate various forms of energy, utilize teleportation and portal control, and vastly increases your durability. As you learn, study, and use the Nega Bands you might even unlock other abilities.,,
Nova Helmet,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Nova Corps function as an intergalactic police and exploration force. They were originally the simple militia of Xandar but have since expanded their operations. They would be small fry if it was not for their Nova Helmets. Their helmets allow them to channel the Nova Force, a nigh unlimited source of power from the early stages of the universe. Channeled through the Nova Helmet, the Nova Force allows you to generate gravimetric shields, travel FTL in space through the use of gravimetric tunneling, fire energy blasts, and other ill defined cosmic type power effects. The helmet also included an advanced HUD, computer, and language translation software.%%%%For an extra 200 points it can come with a copy of the Xandarian Worldmind. The worldmind is a sentient supercomputer with the knowledge of every deceased member of the Nova Corps as well as the entire populace of Xandar. It is a great boon and can provide near limitless information as well as perform any duties of a hyper advanced sentient space supercomputer.,,
Hidden City,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Like the city of Knowhere, the hollowed out head of Celestial you now have a large hollowed out structure that functions as a hidden hideout. This hideout features all the services you could ask for from shops to meeting areas to information about the state of the galaxy. It defaults to an unmarked and difficult to find part of space, cannot be found through regular scanning or searching, and in future jumps will plop itself in any hidden region of space you like.,,
Blade of the Phoenix,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Blade of the Phoenix is imbued with a portion of the power of the Phoenix Force. It has immense power projection abilities and strength and when fully channelled can shatter planets. The blade’s usual form is a large metal looking sword that glows blue. The blade can normally only be wielded by the Rook’shir bloodline of the Shi’ar but this identical copy of the blade recognizes you and anyone you choose as a rightful wielder. Those unauthorized to wield it would find it easier to lift a star than to move this powerful blade.,,
Black Vortex,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Black Vortex was created by an ancient celestial after an alien wished for the ability to unlock her species’ potential. The Black Vortex appears as a large ornate mirror that shows one what they would look like if granted the mirror’s immense cosmic power. If you or anyone else stands before the mirror and says “I submit to the Black Vortex” they will be granted massive and thematically appropriate cosmic powers. The cost for these powers is usually a massive change to a more egotistical and dangerous personality but since you are paying for it feel free to toggle that side effect. You can also restrict who can use the mirror. The immense powers granted by the mirror dissipate with time and exertion but there is no limit to how many times you can submit to the mirror.,,
Infinity Well,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,The Infinity Well was once used to help Thanos in his attempts to conquer the cosmos. It is a large stone well with water the color of deep space flecked with stars and galaxies. When you gaze into the well and ask it a question the Infinity Well can answer any question that could reasonably be known. Things that cannot be answered or are so hidden that no other being could answer it are beyond the reach of the Infinity Well. Feel free to attach this to your warehouse or place it wherever you like.,,
Terrigen Codex,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Inhumans are an experiment of the Kree but have become so much more since their inception. Ruled by their king Black Bolt they have developed amazing technology and unlocked the full secrets of their genome. This codex is a technological database that contains every last piece of technology available to the Inhumans. It also includes their completely mapped and unlocked genome allowing all sorts of alterations as well as the creation of new Inhumans. Please use this wisely as the misuse of the Codex has caused many problems over the years.,,
Power Gem,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,The Power Gem, or Power Stone is one of the fabled Infinity Stones. These powerful objects are the remnants of the singularity that predated the universe and possess universal power when combined. The Power Gem gives its user access to all power and energy. Its basic use provides unlimited stamina and limitless strength depending on how much power is drawn from the stone. With more practice of its use it can unlock any physical based superpower. It produces a feedback circuit with the other stones, being further empowered if you possess the Mind Stone and being able to in turn further empower the Space Stone. If you combine all of the infinity stones together you become an entity capable of completely controlling a single universe. Whichever primary universe you inhabit at the start of each jump is considered the prime universe for stones and is thus the only one you can manipulate. Within each jump the stones are powerless outside of their “prime” universe. Yes, in jumps with a single universe this makes you all powerful. Is usually purple.,,
Ultimate Nullifier,,2,,-8000,,True,,True,,The Ultimate Nullifier is an aspect of Galactus usually kept within his lab on Taa II. It has been used by many heroes and villains over the years for various extreme purposes and is one of the few things the mighty Galactus truly fears. It is considered the most devastating weapon in the universe. Its function is quite simple. The Ultimate Nullifier has the ability to completely obliterate any target the wielder chooses, the only limit being their knowledge, willpower, and ability to concentrate. This fiat backed copy is prevented from accidentally destroying its wielder as well. It can be used not only to destroy beings but also entire timelines and in extreme cases realities. Use it with care, or don’t.,,
Cosmic Control Rod,,2,,-8000,,False,,True,,The Cosmic Control Rod was once used by the vile Annihilus in his attempt to conquer reality. It is the ultimate symbol of authority in the Negative Zone and capable of amazing feats of power. With this in hand, Annihilus was able to control forces that allowed him to bind even the mighty Galactus. The control rod allows the harnessing, manipulation, and creation of the vast cosmological forces of the Negative Zone. It can manipulate vast amounts of these cosmic forces to massively enhance the capabilities of its wielder and provide them a practically limitless lifespan. It can even endow its user with the Negative Zone’s version of the Power Cosmic. It comes with the usual sweet of energy and matter manipulation and is generally limited by your imagination and knowledge.,,

Drop In - Soul Gem,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,The Soul Gem is another of the vaunted Infinity Stones. It is sentient and desires the collection of souls. It gives its user great power over the souls of others. It allows one to peer into other people’s souls, trap souls within a Soul World contained in the gem therefore allowing access to the memories and skills of those trapped.

It is empowered if its user is in possession of the Reality Stone and in turn empowers the Mind Stone. Is usually green or yellow.,,
Tyrant - Throne,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Every Tyrant needs a throne. This item can be customized to your heart’s content. Whether you desire a granite monolith, a golden stool, or a fully pimped out gold and ivory masterpiece you will always look intimidating and dominating when seated upon your throne.

Tyrant - Bionic and Mystic Perfection,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Why be stuck with your baseline body? All true rulers should tower over their soon to be subjects in form and mind. Much like the Mad Titan you have been massively enhanced on every level. Mystical protections, spells, and bindings, as well as cybernetic enhancements and genetic manipulation has turned you into the pinnacle of perfection. Your body is superior in every way to others of your species and even many other species through the cosmos.,,
Tyrant - Universal Church of Truth,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Adam Warlock’s evil self the Magus once created a worship centered around him as a god. It was a powerful and dangerous religion with highly advanced technology that was formed of billions of worshippers from across the universe. You are now the leader and/or god of a similarly massive religion. Your followers possess highly advanced technology that is primarily powered by their faith in you.

Scientist - Issac,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Deep within the moon Titan, the Integral Synaptic Anti-Anionic Computer (I.S.A.A.C) serves the Eternals as one of the most powerful supercomputers in the cosmos. You now have a copy or a unique supercomputer with the same capabilities as Isaac. This intelligent and fully sentient computer system can perform highly advanced predictive analysis, control countless systems of any scale and size and even generate robotic forms for physical manipulation. Anything another supercomputer or AI could perform this one can do better. Any personality traits or the robotic forms it can take are up to you.,,
Scientist - Evolutionary Exoskeleton,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Like the mighty High Evolutionary you possess an advanced protective exoskeleton of any design and appearance you choose. This exoskeleton has advanced protective features that can keep you safe from even the most dangerous of cosmic or personal disasters, accidents, and threats.

Protector - Universal Weapon,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Public Enforcers of the Kree Empire used powerful Universal Weapons to enforce the law of the empire. The most powerful of these universal weapons is wielded by the Supreme Accuser Ronan. You now possess one such weapon. It defaults to the appearance of a large hammer but can be any form you choose. Universal Weapons can manipulate energy and matter, projecting blasts, creating shields, transmuting matter, and other amazing things. The universal weapon can even create stasis fields, gravity nullification fields, and perform processes like genetic scans. I am sure the more you use it the more functions you will learn it has. It defaults to shocking anyone that tries to wield it that is not you.,,
Protector - Quantum Bands,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,The cosmic side of Marvel really likes its fancy bracelets. The Quantum Bands were created by Eon to be granted to his chosen protector of the universe. Somehow, you seem to have gotten your hands on a pair of the mighty bands. These bands draw energy from the Quantum Zone, the source of all potential energy in the Marvel Universe, which gives them a variety of effects.

The helmet includes a HUD and diagnostics features and it lights up to.,,
Freelancer - Cybernetic Eye,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Cybernetics are, perhaps unsurprisingly, common across the universe. However, some are much better than others.

It gives you full vision over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, a suite of sensors and diagnostics, unlimited capacity to record sight and sound around you, and can take a bullet.,,
Freelancer - Element Gun,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This is a copy of the Element Gun wielded by Star Lord. It can fire any of the four elements (Earth, Wind, Air, and Fire) and even combine them for various usages.

The gun will update and include any elements native to settings you visit in other jumps.,,
Freelancer - Space Gem,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,Now to the last of the Infinity Stones/Gems. The Space Gem gives its wielder the ability to manipulate space as they see fit.

Kree Honor Code,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,The Kree are a powerful and imperialistic race of people with very strict law and honor codes. Whether you are Kree or simply follow a similarly strict personal ethic code you find yourself incapable of lying and are unwilling to fight unarmed opponents or give yourself unfair advantages. Cheating of any kind is anathema to you and the thought of bending any rightful laws makes you queasy.,,
Photonic Power,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,The source of your abilities in this world is now based on photonic power. A steady and nearby stream of photons is needed for you to function at full power. The longer you go without sunlight the weaker you will be until you are at baseline human power level. The amount of time it takes to run out of power is based on time and exertion ranging from days without sun to hours or even minutes if you are fighting at full power.,,
Microverse Swap,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,So this is annoying. Something has happened to cause you to be bound on a quantum level with some random Earth kid. For whatever reason if you use your powers too much they will need to recharge and while they are recharging you will be swapped with said kid into a realm called the microverse. While you are there the only thing you can do is talk to the kid until you switch back and then he can talk to you. This will never happen during a vital moment nor will it be for too long but it will always be an inconvenience. Also, the kid never shuts up while he is in the microverse and you can’t tune him out very easily.,,
Negative Zone,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The Negative Zone is an alien universe composed entirely of anti-matter. Time passes faster there, there is no water, most of it is uninhabited, and the parts that are are filled with vile creatures and evil tyrants.

Watch out for Blastaar and Annihilus as they would love to have another toy to help them in their conquests and schemes.,,
Imperial War,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,The Kree and Shi’ar Empires have been in on and off wars for a very long time. They are both hyper advanced imperialistic alien powers with whole teams formed of some of the most powerful super beings in the universe.

They will both drop everything to come after you if and when they find out where you are, even stopping full blown battles against one another.,,
Evil Side,,4,,6000,,True,,False,,Like one Adam Warlock and his Magus, you have an evil side within your psyche. His morality is opposite to whatever your morality is and he seeks to take control of your body or split off from you, if he can. He begins by only being able to talk to you and try to influence you that way but will eventually begin to figure out how to take temporary control or even split off. You must stop him from taking over anyway you can before the end of your time here. If he controls or destroys you before the jump is over your chain is up. He can still be alive, just not in control.,,Retail Rocker
Reality Parasite,,4,,12000,,True,,False,,So this is bad. Somehow, somewhere a portal to a distant reality has opened in this one. This normally would not be the worst but this reality is home to something called a reality parasite. It is a powerful and insidious being that wants nothing more than to eat the entirety of existence. It begins only able to slightly influence and use its power in our realm but the longer it goes without being stopped the more of its cosmic influence it can exert. This is an entity that has been seen to break the fourth wall and is considered a terrifying threat even to some of the heaviest hitters in Marvel. At higher levels of influence it has terrifying cosmic might. Your best chance is to stop it early and seal the portal to its realm. Good luck.,,Retail Rocker
Annihilation Wave,,4,,12000,,True,,False,,Annihilus, tyrant of the Negative Zone and insectoid wielder of the Cosmic Control Rod has put together an invasion force of trillions and invaded the universe. This Annihilation Wave wields terrifying technologies and is led by many powerful cosmic threats. Annihilus is a dangerous threat with the Control Rod and seeks nothing less than the destruction of your reality. In his canonical run he performed such deeds as capturing Galactus and killing nearly half the universe. You have to stop him before he can kill 50% of the universe or you will fail your chain.,,Retail Rocker
First Firmament,,4,,10000,,False,,False,,The Marvel cosmos is a complicated place. The multiverse has gone through several renditions. In its original state it was but a single universe named the First Firmament. This sentient universe eventually overthrown by its creation and has watched as multiverse after multiverse has ruled over what should have been its existence. It has been driven mad and seeks nothing more than to take back control over a cosmos it views as belonging to it. This being is nigh omnipotent, surpassed only by The One Above All and knows you are a threat to its existence. You must stop the Firmament from remaking creation so that it is all there is. Good luck.,,
Thanos and Infinity Gauntlet,,4,,20000,,True,,False,,Thanos has accomplished his dream. He has collected all of the infinity stones and placed them within the gauntlet. He now has complete and total control over the entire universe. The only limit to his power is that the stones only work in their native universe. Thanos is after you thinking you to be the only being capable of overthrowing his new rule over the cosmos. You must survive and separate him from the stones or else your chain will end.,,Retail Rocker
