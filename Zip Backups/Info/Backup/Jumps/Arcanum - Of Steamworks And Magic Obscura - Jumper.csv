Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are a stranger to Arcanum, appearing somewhere out of sight in whatever starting location applies to you. You have no past in this world, no connections to draw on, and no new memories.,,
Specialist,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Yes, ‘specialist’. After all, calling yourself a thief or charlatan wouldn’t be very good for your day-to-day work, would it? You grew up on the streets, and through raw cunning and dedication you have acquired a set of skills that have proven quite useful to yourself. You’re quick, charming, and while you’re not yet living a life of luxury, your talent for... ahem, creatively acquiring the means to improve your station will likely see you become quite successful regardless.,,
Veteran,,0,,00,,True,,False,,You are one of the many men (or one of the markedly fewer women) who’ve seen enough combat in their life that no battle will really surprise them anymore. Soldier, mercenary, bodyguard, you’ve likely done it all and more. The social upheaval caused by recent scientific advancements and the widespread use of the steam engine means tempers run high on every level from the dirtiest street to the fanciest mansion. And with such rampant tensions, a good sword arm is still in high demand no matter if some might call it old-fashioned.,,
Arcanist,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Being a spellcaster in Arcanum means having a thorough understanding of magical theory, thewillpower to enforce your will upon the world, and the endurance to pay the price for your work. While the upsurge of technological progress is making the use of magic fall out of favor more and more each day, you chose tradition and wisdom over blind progress. Your studies completed, you are ready to show Arcanum that the past holds enough power to change the present and shape the future.,,
Inventor,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Technology is rapidly changing the shape of society, and you are determined to be at the forefront of the new revolution! You’ve always liked taking things apart to figure out how they work, and you’ve managed to turn that curiosity into a basic education at Tarant’s University. Now that you’ve graduated,you set out to push the boundaries of science even further, your head filled with designs, half-formed ideas, and the dream of being the next Gilbert Bates.,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Now that you know who you are, it’s time to see where you are. Roll 1d8 to pick a random starting location or choose where to begin for 50 CP.%%%%%%1. Shrouded Hills: a small and quiet frontier town in decline, built around a depleted mine.%%%%2. Tarant: the largest, most industrialized city in Arcanum and capital of the Unified Kingdom.%%%%3. Ashbury: a coastal town in the east of Arcanum overlooked by a large, ruined castle.%%%%4. Blackroot: a smaller city that serves as a trade hub, on the border between Tarant and Dernholm.%%%%5. Dernholm: a city that's been in steady decline after the recent war, due to its lack of industry.%%%%6. Stillwater: a small town in the frigid north, famous for its magical swords and tourism.%%%%7. Caladon: the second-largest city of Arcanum, it possesses a large magic presence alongside industry.%%%%8. Free Pick from any city or town in Arcanum,,
Drop In - A Credit To Your Race,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Arcanum is a world where the vast potential of scientific and technological progress has completely changed the world over the past few decades... but this has not always been a good thing. Racism is more widespread than ever, women are treated as second-rate citizens in most areas, and the poor toil away in smoke-filled factories while the rich grow ever richer. It’s easy to be considered another man’s‘ lesser’ due to circumstances beyond your control, but you seem to have become remarkably resistant to this.%%%%While the world around you will be just as bigoted as before, with this perk those around youwill not treat you harshly because of your race, background or other such aspects of your existence.,,
Drop In - In the Right Place at the Right Time,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Arcanum is a big world, and it’s full of opportunities if you know where to look. Be it the occasional helping hand for the man in the street or being hired as an explorer, investigator or bodyguard, you’ve got an easy time finding people and organisations that might be willing to hire you to do some work.%%%%These jobs tend to be short, not very well paid and unlikely to directly lead to any sort of permanent employment on their own, but they are excellent for forming a network of contacts or improving your reputation in various social circles.%%%%If you play your cards right (possibly literally), you’ll likely have plenty of ways to get something better.,,
Drop In - Stat Allocation,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Living in Arcanum means having skills and the experience to use them well, but unfortunately a lot of those skills are... rather risky to practice. An amateur pickpocket will likely end up behind bars before they’ve become good enough at stealing to not get caught, swordplay has some major risks to health and wellbeing, and let's not discuss the risks of learning Black Necromancy or how to create home-brewn explosives. This perk allows you to learn things safely by cheating at what you do.%%%%When you’re putting in the effort to learn a skill or improve yourself some way, you can transfer a portion of that effort into learning a completely different set of skills - at the cost of your original progress.%%%%For example, let’s say you spend a week with your nose in the books to learn advanced Herbology. Using this power while you’re working might see you end up with only four days of progress in Herbology, but at the same time you can have improved your physical strength as if you’d been doing exercises instead of studying for the remaining three days.%%%%You can transfer at most half your total time, but you can divide that portion among any number of other goals. Your transferred training will proceed however fast it would have if you focused on that goal instead; having an advantage at intellectual pursuits doesn't suddenly make you talented at physical exercise and vice versa.%%%%Likewise, you can't learn skills or abilities you wouldn't be able to learn without this perk. This perk only transfers progress, it doesn’t let you pull self-improvement out of nowhere. Spending a month lounging around on the beaches of Cattan won’t suddenly make you a Doctor Of Engineering, because you still need to put in the effort somehow.,,
Drop In - Blessing of the All Father,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Scattered throughout Arcanum are long-forgotten altars to ancient gods, and much like those who make the journey to offer the right sacrifices, you have been blessed.%%%%The moment you arrive in Arcanum, you’ll find that every part of your being has been slightly improved. You are just a bit stronger, a bit smarter and beautiful... and most amazingly, for any skill you use, be it those found in this world or elsewhere, you will always start with some amount of experience.%%%%Even if it’s something you’d never done before, you’ll be able to do it as though you have enough practice to be a novice. This will not make you an expert and certainly not a master, but you’ll never again have to start from scratch.,,
Drop In - The Tapestry of Fate,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,Luck is a fickle thing, but some people can make even regular ‘luck’ look like something mundane.%%%%In Arcanum, it is possible for exceptional individuals to gain what those rare few who experience them call ‘Fate Points’. These points, when used, can cause the world to very briefly conspire in the user’s favor, with spectacular results.%%%%That one-in-a-million rifle shot is guaranteed to hit your target in the most vulnerable place you could have possibly hit them, you could unlock a vault safe with little more than a few iron filings and bits of string despite never having picked a lock before, and so on.%%%%Fate Points are very versatile, but can only be spent on a single action that takes a fairly short amount of time to complete: a brief conversation to convince someone of something would apply, a lengthy process to invent a new technology or master a magical spell would not.%%%%You gain a Fate Point each day, and can keep up to ten Fate Points in reserve.,,
Specialist - First Impressions,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Why be a bandit when you could live the high life, charming the rich and easily-manipulated until you figure out where they keep their keys or the combination to their personal safe?%%%%You’re quite adept at improving your appearance, be it with make-up, precision shaving or whatever other methods you prefer. After all, you’re far more likely to get that opportunity you’re looking for if you make a good first impression.%%%%As a side effect, you’ve become quite precise with your fingers, something that will come in handy for picking locks as much as it does for applying eyeliner.,,
Specialist - Sticky Fingers,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Any thug can threaten someone with an empty revolver or do a grab-and-run for people’s wallets when they’re at the general store, but a real thief can rob someone blind and leave them unaware for hours or even days.%%%%Your talent and speed at picking pockets without being noticed is second to none, and you’ll never have to worry about your fingers getting stuck or that wallet, pocket watch or other valuable trinket snagging on your mark’s clothes.%%%%As a side effect, you’re also particularly adept at planting things, such as illegal substances, forged documents, or perhaps a live grenade if you’re looking for a more... spectacular exit.,,
Specialist - A Discerning Eye,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,To be successful in this ‘business’ means to have a sharp eye for which people would make good marks, and which places would be most likely to contain goods you might want to acquire.%%%%You now have a vague awareness of what people are carrying with them, such as valuable jewelry, weapons or documents of interest. Similarly, you’ll have a sixth sense that gives you an idea of the contents of locked boxes, vaults, and similar, hard-to-reach storage places.%%%%You won’t know exactly what you’ll find if you’re going to try and rob a target, but you’ll know if it’s worth it or not with nothing but a glance.,,
Specialist - Gilded Tongue,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,It’s no secret that beneath the veneer of civility there is a lot of distrust and antagonism between the various organisations, races and other factions in Arcanum. Convincing people to work together, especially in a way that furthers your own schemes, can be tricky at the best of times.%%%%Fortunately, you’re more than up to the task. The more someone is opposed to working with you or others due to things like their ideology or racial, magical or national background, the more convincing you’ll become when you speak to them in order to change their mind.,,
Specialist - Master Of Shadows,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,People would call you a ghost, a fairy tale, or the greatest assassin of Arcanum, except they wouldn’t even know you’re the one that infamy applies to.%%%%You are untraceable, unseen, and impossible to keep out of just about any place that’s not sealed air-tight.%%%%Not only are you an absolute master at infiltration and stealth, you possess the remarkable ability to disappear from observation. You could be in plain view, during a duel in an open field, and yet you can hide from your targets. You don’t even go invisible, your foes just... lose you, for a few moments.%%%%They’ll still know you’re around and will certainly try to find you again, but they’ll have to be quick about it.%%%%After all, you’re not just good at hiding, but at coming out of hiding as well, and a quick blade in someone else’s back is an excellent way to prevent them from ever seeing you again.,,
Veteran - Muscle And Steel,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Armor tends to be heavy, and swinging a solid steel battleaxe around can become rather tiring after a while. Long hours training and traveling have left you stronger and tougher than you once were, and you find that you’re quite comfortable wearing armor of any kind no matter how heavy it may be.,,
Veteran - Knight Of The Future,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Combat styles such as traditional swordsmanship, shields and archery are quickly falling out of favor in the rapidly advancing world of Arcanum. Rather than completely abandoning your old skills in favor of learning how to use firearms or clockwork machinery, you’ve decided to adapt instead.%%%%You are exceptionally talented at integrating your own combat techniques with things like mechanized swords, magically returning boomerangs and all kinds of other extravagant ‘upgrades’, without compromising on the raw functionality of mundane combat.,,
Veteran - Feint Of Blades,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Combat is as much about controlling the flow of battle and the moves of your opponents as it is about your own strikes and reflexes.%%%%In addition to gaining a significant talent at dodging, you’re particularly adept at tricking your opponents in battle - and punishing them for their mistakes. Tripping, feigning a vulnerability only to drive your foe into the ground when they over-extend on their attack, and all manner of other dirty tricks are yours to use and abuse.%%%%You don’t fight fair, but then again... why would you, if a fair fight is one you might lose?,,
Veteran - Master-At-Arms,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,With the many forms of equipment available in Arcanum, a soldier could train for decades and never learn how to use everything that’s out there. Fortunately, you don’t need to.%%%%Whenever you take up a weapon, wear a suit of armor, or seek to use some other item that’s meant for personal use in combat, you will instantly be aware of the basic principles of applying it. You might not have the raw strength,or even the right number of limbs to use it perfectly, but you’ll always have some understanding of how it should be used.%%%%For example, you might realize a sword might get empowered by applying specific settings on the electrical machinery embedded in the hilt, but not which switch is on/off and which is hot/cold.%%%%This skill does not work on items that require multiple users or that are not ‘wielded’ as such, including team-operated weapons, vehicles and remote-controlled systems.,,
Veteran - Flawless,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,You don’t make a career out of fighting if you’re prone to making mistakes - or at least, not a very longone, since a single misstep could mean your end.%%%%You’ve been fighting for a while, and you’ll likely keep doing so for quite a bit longer... for you don’t make mistakes in combat. Ever. You might fight across a hundred battlefields without ever tripping, you could fight under cover of night without ever missing the gleam of an approaching blade, or do battle to the point that exhaustion threatens to kill you outright without fumbling or losing your grip.%%%%Not only that, but you will instinctively take the choices you would have made if you had the time to calmly think things through. Seeing your enemy move only a split second before you have to act will still see you respond with that one perfect counter you practiced five years ago, before you even have time to realize it’s the best response you could have taken.%%%%In short, you will always fight at absolute top form regardless of the circumstances. Perfection in every motion, limited only by your own skill and understanding of combat.,,
Arcanist - The Path Of Tradition,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,To wield magic, one must have the drive and determination to shape and reshape the world according to their vision.%%%%Your willpower is substantial, and while this is most obviously useful for controlling the arcane energies of the world, it’s also come in handy in some other aspects of your life.%%%%Even if the socialites and commoners of this world are unlikely to appreciate the true power you possess, the kind of confidence you carry yourself with would still make you quite charismatic.,,
Arcanist - Tireless,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,To work magic in Arcanum is exhausting, possibly even more so than fighting with strength and steel. You possess significantly greater endurance when it comes to wielding the power of magic than your peers, and will more quickly recover from even the most taxing spells, be they those from Arcanum’s schools of magic or powers you’ve learned elsewhere.%%%%Your overall stamina is doubled, and you'll recover from exertion roughly 25% faster than before.,,
Arcanist - Expert of the Arcane,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Your long years of wielding the power of magic have left you especially attuned to mystical forces.%%%%The casting times and magical energy needed to fuel your spells is reduced by 25%, and your magic is both 25% more powerful and ignores 25% of an enemy’s magical resistances (such as the magical resistances found in those skilled in technological disciplines).,,
Arcanist - Techbane,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Using magic around technology can be a hazardous thing, but it can also be used to your advantage.%%%%After studying how magical energies may interfere with various devices, you’ve learned how to unleash and direct a powerful wave of raw, unshaped magical energy that will infuse technology, disrupting their function or destroying them outright. The greater your magical prowess and the morespells and effects you’ve mastered, the greater the amount of raw power you can channel into this effect and the more devastating its results.%%%%The wrath of a master magician could see them disrupt the machinery across entire towns, rending apart their electrical gizmos and mighty steam engines as if they were nothing!%%%%The magic studied in Arcanum is most effective for this ability, but other forms of arcane power will also provide a benefit.,,
Arcanist - Regenerative Shell,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,A technique that was largely lost after the Age Of Legends, mages of great power could once use this magical gift to ward off death itself. When using this ability, your spirit retreats into a cocoon of sorts, formed of raw magical power. Within this shell, you will recover from your injuries until you emerge, once more at full strength.%%%%The more severe your injuries are, the longer the shell will need to restore you, and you are completely insensate while inside. Likewise, the more arcane power you can draw on, the faster your recovery will be. It’s not unheard of for magicians with crippling or life-threatening injuries to need months or years before they emerge once more, and on at least one occasion a nearly-dead mage spent a thousand years within a shell because he had already spent most of his power.%%%%The shell itself is nearly indestructible; the Vendigroth Device was the only known method in Arcanum for killing a magician that has mastered this technique. In other worlds, forces of similarly great power may be able to break the shell and kill you, though this becomes more difficult as your magical power grows.%%%%Should you reach the end of your time in any world, the shell will always collapse, potentially forcing you out with some of your injuries if your regeneration is not yet complete. The shell may activate automatically to prevent your death once per jump, but must otherwise be consciously activated. This limitation is removed if you complete your chain and acquire your Spark, enabling you to recover from imminent death any number of times.,,
Inventor - Wired Watchmaker,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Long hours hunched over the machinery and books that define your profession have left you with a keen eye for detail.%%%%Your eyesight is excellent even in the occasionally poorly-lit workshops you frequent, and your mind has sharpened to the point you’ll easily remember the details of any schematic you’re trying to assemble. You can still wear that monocle of course, but this time, you’ll wear it for style!,,
Inventor - Scrounging,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It’s a sad fact that finding the right materials and components for your research and manufacturing can be a difficult task. Collecting the necessary tools to create Molotov Cocktails and Healing Salves might be fairly easy, but for more complex devices it can take days or weeks to find the things you need. Lesser inventors might need to keep track of every source of tools, from the General Store to the local junk merchant to areas for finding medicinal herbs... but not you!%%%%Your keen sense for finding the materials you need means you’ll always have a vague idea of just where to go to buy that Minute Steamworks, Tesla Coil, or Spirit Of Camphor, and you’re quite likely to walk into the store right when they’re on discount. Amazing!,,
Inventor - Schizo-Tech Expert,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Technology advances in leaps and bounds, which may leave the enterprising inventor with some compatibility issues. After all, upgrading the old model of steam-powered Automaton with an electromagnetic hydraulics system may give it the dexterity to paint works of art as much as cleave your foes in half, but that’s hardly a success if the optical systems receive interference from your upgrades and rend your servitor blind!%%%%You’ve become exceedingly adept at integrating multiple kinds of technology, especially when the various parts would normally be incompatible. Using different energy sources, blending outdated design principles with the latest advancements of the future and more are all within your grasp. Incredible!,,
Inventor - Magebane,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,At once an unfortunate consequence of technological advancement and the mark of one who’s reached the pinnacle of his own craft, it is well known that a respected inventor can warp the magical energies of those around him through his very presence. Through meticulous study of this effect, you have learned how to create and direct a fantastic resonance wave that draws on nearby technological devices and even your own skill to enforce the might of reality upon those you target.%%%%With every scientific law or technology you’ve mastered, the effect grows stronger until a master inventor can send the Ether churning with little more than a flick of his wristwatch.%%%%Understanding the technologies devised in Arcanum will be most effective for this ability, but other forms of technological ingenuity will also provide a benefit. Causing the spells and enchantments of even the greatest magicians to fizzle and unravel has never been this easy!,,
Inventor - Magitek Adaptation,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,It is not possible to combine magic and technology, everyone knows this... but once upon a time, everyone knew magic was the only path to power, and they, too, were proven wrong. After learning that ages ago, in the old society of Vendigroth, their inventors and engineers found a way to manipulate even magic with their devices... you have taken the first steps on a path that no other inventor in Arcanum has found since. Magic defies all laws of physics, but it does obey laws of its own, and with rigorous study you will be able to discover how to tap into these alterations of the natural world.%%%%Initially, you’ll be hard-pressed to build devices that use the simplest of spells from Arcanum’s magical disciplines, but as you experiment and your experience grows, you’ll be able to wield more and more of the spells of this world.%%%%With every method you devise to bind magical energies into a technological shell, the process becomes just a bit easier, just a bit faster.%%%%Eventually, you’ll even be able to use technology to wield magics from the worlds beyond Arcanum. Impossible, but true!,,
Item Import,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Increases initial cost by 50 CP%%%%If you like some of the items available here but don't feel like they quite suit you for some reason or another, you may instead opt to import a roughly similar item you possess instead. For example, you could import one of your own swords for 'Elite Weapon' to give it the fiery attacks of a Pyrotechnic Axe, or install the ‘Atlas Of Arcanum’ on a digital device as a user-friendly application. You may likewise combine multiple items you purchase here using the same principle, such as combining the Zeppelin and the Medical Arachnid with Item Import to grant the airship a dedicated medical staff (steam-powered or otherwise).,,
Drop In - Consumables Stash,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This leather bag is filled with various potions, herbs, healing salves and similar single-use items. There won’t be anything truly spectacular here, but it’s still a very useful collection, especially if you expect to need the occasional boost. The bag restocks used materials in about a week.,,
Drop In - The Fates,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Wearing this pair of engraved rings makes you feel luckier, somehow. Fortune smiles on you, and you’ll find that games of chance are a bit more likely to go in your favour and you’ll score lucky hits in combat with surprising regularity. Wearing both rings at the same time makes the effect even more pronounced, though each has an effect on its own.,,
Drop In - Kathorn Spectacles,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This pair of glasses is inset with a pair of green, crystal lenses, much like the Wheel Clan Spectacles used to reveal the hidden entrance to the Wheel Clan’s mountain stronghold.%%%%While you might need a moment or two to adjust to the tinted view, seeing the world through these glasses has the advantage of revealing all sorts of useful details, including some that would normally be invisible. Finding things like traps, hidden doors, faults in illusions, and writings that are only visible in moonlight will be substantially easier when wearing this item.,,
Drop In - Atlas Of Arcanum,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,This high-quality folder contains various maps, sketches and similar descriptions of locales across the planet.%%%%While the accuracy of the maps will obviously be dependent on how frequently people visit (a map of Tarant’s streets will be effectively flawless, one for the Bangellian Deep will be little more than sketches), you can find descriptions of just about any area of interest and the maps become more detailed if you visit in person.%%%%Although tracking down things like buried treasure and hidden altars will still be very difficult, you’ll have a bit of an edge regardless.%%%%The folder will automatically update with similar maps for any new world you find yourself in, and the quality will rapidly increase for any location you visit in person.,,
Specialist - Elegant Dress or Smoking Jacket,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This outfit is high-quality, stylish, and seems to actively resist ever getting dirty or scuffed. It’s perfectly tailored to your physique by Tarant’s finest tailors, and almost seems to adjust its size to fit you every time you take it out of the closet.%%%%Most importantly, its excellent quality means that whenever you wear it, you’ll find that people are just a bit nicer to you. It’s no substitute for actual ‘people skills’, but on the other hand... every bit helps, doesn’t it?,,
Specialist - Expert Lockpicks,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This small collection of tools is just the thing if you need to get past a mechanical lock of some kind, or if you need to trip a trap without getting hurt in the process. For easy concealment, you can pack these tools up to disguise them as a watch, pendant, or a similar personal accessory.%%%%Unbreakable unless you need them to be.,,
Specialist - Tools Of The Trade,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This matched set of clothes gives you a major boost to your stealth and other rogue-ish skills. A Chameleon Cloak gives you a substantial advantage in remaining unseen, a pair of Elven Boots ensure your footsteps are as silent as a dream, and your Gloves Of Dexterity give you the fine control you’ll need during all your endeavors.,,
Specialist - Silent Death,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A collection of small, stoppered vials and other tools of the assassin’s trade, this set contains enough murder for a solid double-digit body count at minimum, and more if you’re willing to get creative.%%%%However, you’ll have access to more than just deadly poisons. Ranging from the harmless Anaestesizer to the terrifying Mental Inhibitor, there’s plenty of other tricks in here if you ever need some less deadly effects.%%%%Spent poisons will restock in about a week.,,
Veteran - Chainmail armor,,2,,-500,,False,,False,,This suit of armor provides excellent protection for a modest price. It’s easy to clean and less cumbersome than some of the higher-end armors, making it especially useful for long travels and drawn-out fights. Not only that, but you’ll find you can keep using it in situations such as social gatherings without turning heads, or while sleeping without hindering your rest. It’s remarkably difficult to damage, and any damage it receives seems to slowly vanish when you’re not paying attention.,,
Veteran - Quality Broadsword,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This weapon is nothing fancy, but it certainly gets the job done. Better still, it’s neither magically or technologically aligned, meaning it can be used by anyone without penalties. The edge is wickedly sharp, and will never dull matter how many Orcs you run through. Forged specifically for your use, this weapon can be wielded easily regardless of your strength or skill. Indeed, in your hands, it would seem that the blade is half as heavy as it would be in anyone else’s!,,
Veteran - Elite Weapon,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You possess your choice of a melee or ranged weapon that will be the envy of any competitor.%%%%If you are inclined towards the magical talents, an Arcane Greatsword or Arcane bow will surely give you the power to carve a path through your enemies. These weapons are especially accurate, seemingly guiding themselves through an opponent’s defenses.%%%%If, on the other hand, you prefer the absolute laws of science, you may bring forth the awe-inspiring power of a Pyrotechnic Axe or a Pyrotechnic Bow. These weapons are slower and more cumbersome, but strike with devastating heat great enough to melt the armor off a knight’s chest.%%%%Each of these weapons is effectively indestructible, even against opponents that might damage or destroy lesser weapons.,,
Veteran - Elite armor,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,You possess a high-quality, custom-fitted suit of armor that’s one of the most powerful forms of protection available in all of Arcanum.%%%%A full suit of Arcane Platemail is the strongest magical armor available on Arcanum, and is much lighter than any similar mundane suit.%%%%Alternatively, you may acquire a suit of Machined Platemail. This armor is much heavier and bulkier, but its steam-powered hydraulics will increase your strength to both allow you to wear it much like regular armor, and to increase the force behind your attacks.%%%%Both forms of armor are all-but indestructible, and will automatically resize to fit you.,,
Arcanist - Spells,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Not quite 'items' per se, you’ve mastered three commonly used spells from the magical schools of Arcanum.%%%%You may choose to use this on a single school, or spread them out to become a ‘dabbler’ of sorts.,,
Arcanist - Scroll collection,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This case is filled with various magical scrolls that can be used if you’d rather not spend your own magical energy or you haven’t mastered the spell you need. The case is mostly lower-end scrolls, though a few high-level spells can be found here as well. Oddly enough, spells you don’t know are available more often than those you’ve mastered already.%%%%Used scrolls replenish in about a week.,,
Arcanist - Magister’s Weapon,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You possess your choice of a powerful magical weapon suitable for any Arcanist.%%%%You may choose to receive an Arcane Staff, granting you substantially increased magical power that you can use to fuel your spells without drawing on your own energy stores%%%% Alternatively, you may choose to receive a one-of-a-kind Stillwater Blade that grants you increased skill at summoning various animals and monsters, especially those called using magic of the Nature school.,,
Arcanist - Familiar,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Much like the magical beast summoned by those who’ve mastered the school of Summoning, this small dragon is a powerful and faithful protector.%%%%Unlike the normal version, this Familiar will retain any memories should it be killed, and as such it can be taught basic skills and tricks other than simply fighting for your protection. It can be summoned to your side with but a word and does not count as a Companion, unless it somehow gains enough intelligence to count as its own person.,,
Inventor - Designs,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This small portfolio contains any three schematics of your choice, out of any you might find in Arcanum. You may choose both standard technologies such as the Feather Weight Axe and Elephant Rifle, as well as prototype inventions that aren’t found in the curriculum of the technological disciplines, such as those for the Miracle Cure, Electro Armor or Tranquilizer Gun.,,
Inventor - Grenades,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This fireproofed box is filled with explosive ordnance, from the humble flash and smoke grenades to the terrifying explosive and knockout gas grenades. Each grenade is carefully labeled and includes a user’s manual, although it does not come with any advice for throwing them beyond simply keeping a safe distance. You might want to practice your throwing skills with something a little less... volatile. The box replenishes used grenades in about a week, and tends to restock those grenades you use most often slightly faster or in larger numbers.,,
Inventor - Prototype Gun,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You begin with a handheld engine of destruction, one of the iconic guns of an inventor.%%%%Your first choice is a Tesla Rifle, a mighty rifle that will strike with the power of lightning itself, bypassing most normal defenses and electrocuting your target outright.%%%%Alternatively, you may wield a Mechanized Gun to rain leaden death upon your foes, with a rate of fire unmatched in Arcanum and a manufacturer’s guarantee it will never jam.%%%%Both guns come with a suitable ammo supply of charges or bullets, and instructions for crafting replacements.,,
Inventor - Medical Arachnid,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,This amazing machine is a large spider-like robot the size of a large dog that’s powered by a small steam engine.%%%%It’s capable of basic friend and foe identification, and will provide medical treatment to you and anyone you designate as an ally. It can’t heal poisons or diseases, but any physical injury will rapidly vanish in it’s diligent care.%%%%If threatened, it will use the large blades at the ends of its limbs to rend your foes to shreds.%%%%Re-appears in the Warehouse in about a week if destroyed.,,
The Tarantian,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,You receive a subscription to ‘The Tarantian’, Arcanum's most well-informed newspaper. The stories are typically unbiased and are mostly-true at the very least, though the paper is not omniscient and remains limited to what a good reporter could uncover without breaking the law.%%%%Guaranteed to be at least vaguely interesting to you regardless of your news preferences, appears daily in your Warehouse, and it will continue to report on events in the outside world even if you leave Arcanum. It may on occasion include articles that could lead to adventure, though you’ll need to decide for yourself what stories are worth that personal bit of attention.,,
Iron Clan Safe,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This heavy iron casket looks old and worn, but the ravages of time were unable to mar the exquisite craftsmanship of this safe.%%%%Although the lock might seem to be something one could pick with enough skill or patience, this is only an illusion; the safe will not open for anyone but you no matter what they might try.%%%%It can be unlocked from the inside, if you care to use it as an emergency hideout. It’s also effectively impossible to damage by anything that doesn’t leave a big crater.,,
The Eye of Kraka-Tur,,2,,-1500,,False,,True,,This fossilized eye once belonged to Kraka-Tur, a Human who granted himself the power of the last of the dragons using a magical ritual fueled by dragon blood. Although true dragons are now extinct in Arcanum, Kraka-Tur himself was transformed into a half-dragon by the ritual, and you now possess the last part of his body remaining in this world.%%%%With some study, you might be able to find a way to tap into such power as well - be it for yourself or to transform others...,,
Zeppelin,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,A sister ship to the IFS Zephyr, this magnificent lighter-than-air dirigible is a luxurious aircraft capable of transporting a variety of aristocrats, intellectuals, and other members of high society (along with an equal variety of servants, stowaways and other riff-raff) on a journey of comfort and excitement.%%%%You are now the sole owner, and while the ship itself is perhaps less famous than the Zephyr, it is nonetheless an excellent source of transportation - not to mention it allows you to make more than a few connections with the upper classes as well as make a decent income by selling tickets. Beyond that, its construction has been made more robust and the on-board security force will do its best to ensure it will never suffer the Zephyr’s fate.,,
Madam Lil's,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,This establishment offers companionship of various kinds to those gentlemen (and ladies) willing to pay their rates. You've become the owner for one reason or another, and you'll receive a share of the profits. It’s enough to live on if you’re frugal, but while it won’t make you rich, the main use for this place is the gossip. The clientele includes many of the rich and powerful, and the girls are so very good at listening.%%%%While the Madam might not officially run a spy network, that doesn't change the fact that she is quite well informed. The brothel also works reasonably well as a place to stay in an emergency, though the company likely costs extra.%%%%Nothing’s stopping you from earning some time if you’re willing to occasionally help the Madam with her problems (or opportunities), and you could of course try whatever methods of persuasion you prefer. Just remember: the girls work for a living, so they’ll have listened to plenty of charmers before you came along.%%%%You'll receive the deed to a similar house of sins in future jumps, though their exact nature might differ a bit depending on setting.,,
Vivifier,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,An elixir so exceedingly advanced and rare that merely knowing how to make the components to craft this is already a skill sufficient to make a man rich. Indeed, the secrets to creating the Vendigrothian Vivifier are a lost art, and even if one scoured the entire Vendigroth Wastes you’d be lucky to find enough reagents to make just one of these marvels.%%%%The ultimate triumph of science, the Vivifier is a compound that makes one... more than they were, and even a single dose grants a permanent increase to nearly every aspect of the user’s being.%%%%The user’s physique is enhanced to provide greater strength, dexterity, constitution and beauty, while increases to intelligence, willpower, charisma and perception ensure the mind is likewise made superior.%%%%Furthermore, this refined form of an already marvelous compound seems to become more potent as the user’s own abilities grow mightier.%%%%That said, care must be taken not to grow oneself beyond one’s ability - a Half-Ogre’s might may not be so exciting if you proceed to break every wine glass you try to lift to your lips!%%%%You receive a single dose of this marvelous compound every year.%%%%%%Using the Vivifier grants a boost between anywhere from 5% ‘peak human’ ability (as an average human) to 1% of your current stats if you are vastly stronger. Multiple uses will see the effects stack with no upper limit.,,
The Vendigroth Device,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,This ancient machine is about the size of a man’s torso, and appears rusted and neglected, the dust of centuries still covering its greenish steel exterior. It was developed by the Vendigroth inventors of ages past, and has only one use: to kill the unkillable. It was once designed as a means to kill magicians of great power who would otherwise simply retreat into their regenerative shells, and its creation led to the utter destruction of Vendigroth when one such mage learned of its power.%%%%The Vendigroth Device can only be deployed against a stationary foe, and only if they are unable to protect themselves from it due to injury, paralysis, unconsciousness or a similar method (merely being asleep will not be enough and cause them to instantly wake up).%%%%However, once the device attunes to your target and activates, it will cause a cataclysmic feedback within the target’s spiritual essence, causing them to quite literally erase themselves out of their own metaphysical existence.%%%%When slain this way, the target can never again be restored to life by any method, since literally nothing remains of them in this world or any afterlife.%%%%The device can only be used once before burning out, but it will reappear in the Warehouse after one week and comes with the full, devilishly complex, schematics if you wish to construct more.,,
A Dwarf, An Elf And A Half-Ogre Walk Into A Bar...,,3,,00,,False,,True,,You may import a previous companion or create a new one for 50 CP per purchase, or pay 300 CP to import and/or create 8 companions at once. They get a free background and 300 CP to spend as they choose on Perks and Items, and may take Drawbacks for additional points if they wish.,,
Canon companion,,3,,-500,,False,,True,,With each purchase, you may convince one existing character in Arcanum, such as Virgil or Alexander,to join you on your travels. You must still convince them to follow you, but you may ask any number of people until one of them agrees.,,
A Treatise On The Metaphysical Duality Of Arcanum,,4,,00,,True,,False,,Mandatory%%%%Everyone in Arcanum knows that magic and technology do not work well together. Because magic relies on altering the natural laws that govern reality and technology relies on using (and reinforcing)those very same laws, it is nearly impossible to combine the two safely and effectively.%%%%Each person has what is called ‘Aptitude’, a measure of how strongly they are aligned towards technology or magic. A person with great skill in engineering and chemistry would possess technological aptitude, and someone who’s mastered the school of Phantasm would gain magical aptitude. Each type of aptitude cancels out the other: should a person possess sufficient skills for both a technological aptitude of 25 and a magical aptitude of 50, they would effectively have a magical aptitude of 25 and no technological aptitude at all.%%%%Someone with a high magical Aptitude will find their spells and enchantments to be more powerful, but the magical power they radiate will disrupt nearby technology. Much like the 'Techbane' Perk, a powerful magician might cause technological gadgets to fizzle or self-destruct by their mere presence.%%%%Likewise, someone with a high technological Aptitude will find their technology to be more powerful and reliable, but they also weaken and disrupt magical energies around them. Much like the 'Magebane' Perk, renowned Inventors can seem all but immune to magics and may ruin a magical storekeeper's wares by merely walking into their shop.%%%%However, this effect also applies to a person’s own abilities: inventors are barely capable of using magic and enchanted items at all, and a gun in the hands of a magician is as likely to explode as it is to fire normally. Those who balance their Aptitudes by learning equally of both paths (or who ignore such skills altogether) are considered Neutral; they may use both magical effects and technology without penalty, but they cannot do so with the kind of power of one who dedicates themselves to only one type.%%%%%%You and your Companions are subject to this as well. Any magical or technological skills you acquire in Arcanum will alter your Aptitude, interfering with each other as they do for everyone else in the world. If you wish to use both magic and technology during your stay here, you will need to balance your skills... or choose one path over the other.%%%%Powers and items you have purchased with CP in other worlds are exempt from this rule, and will always function at full strength without causing or suffering interference. However, anything else you use during your stay here, including non-CP purchased items you brought with you from other worlds, magic you learned without ‘fiat-backed’ sources, or simply magic and technology found in Arcanum itself, will still be subject to the influences of Aptitude. Any magic and technology you learn during your stay here will lose their risks once you travel to other worlds, since this effect is caused by the malleable nature of the laws of physics in Arcanum and not the particular type of magic or technology found here.,,
The Living One,,4,,00,,False,,False,,The Panarii church that extolls the virtues of Nasrudin’s teachings is mostly considered a religion dedicated to compassion and wisdom, but there is one thing that takes a prominent place in their teachings: that in a time of great darkness, the spirit of Nasrudin would be reborn on wings of fire in a being known as ‘The Living One’. A hero that would save all of Arcanum. Your starting location is changed such that you arrive not on Arcanum but above it: on the IFS Zephyr just as the airship’s voyage is brought to a sudden, deadly end. Within the wreckage, you will find a dying gnome who asks you to take his ring and ‘find the boy’. It is a request that, should you pursue it,will find you on a path that will see just how much of the Panarii prophecy is true, and how much of it applies to you...%%%%This Drawback may be taken by either you or a single Companion, not by multiple individuals.,,
Scarred,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,Your face is marred by a horrible injury. Whether it’s from a bad hit in battle, burns or some other kind of accident, your visage is truly abhorrent. While it doesn’t hurt or otherwise hinder you, it does cause some obvious problems in any social situation. The scars themselves can’t be removed or hidden by things like magic or medicine, though you could go for a stylish mask of some sort if you don’t mind people thinking you’re really, really weird instead of just ugly.,,Retail Rocker
Four-Eyed,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Your eyesight’s pretty damn bad. Glasses can be used to correct it to some extent, but you shouldn’t expect to get anything better than 20/40 vision at best. Even medical intervention and devices such as the spectacular clockwork optics that are being developed at the university of Tarant won’t do much, if anything, to help.,,
Bad Reputation,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Whether you’ve done so or not, people believe you’ve done something horrible, like stealing a famous painting or streaking through the streets of Tarant. Expect people to dislike you from the start, and to need substantially more effort getting on anyone’s good side. Trying to use disguises merely seems to add ‘compulsively deceitful’ to your possibly-earned list of flaws.,,
Marked,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Oh, you’ve pissed someone off, Jumper. You’ve got a bounty on your head, and since you’ll never figure out who put it there, you’re going to be stuck dealing with the consequences. Bounty hunters and assassins will hound your steps, especially in the wilderness where you’re away from anyone who might lend assistance (like the town guard).%%%%Sure, most of them will present a threat barely above that of the average Orcish highwayman, but every now and then you might need to deal with the kind of man who’s made murder their living - and has done so for a long time.,,
Sickly,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Might does not make right, but if it did you’d always be wrong. Your physical prowess is...substandard to say the least. Your strength is barely enough to get you through the day, and exercising is right out with your frail constitution. You can always go for the classy look with a suit and cane, but don’t expect to use anything that’s much heavier than that. A rapier might be doable, a battleaxe is most certainly not.,,
Idiot Savant,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Jumper am good smart. Get much edumcashon, make stuff go clunk and zap. Uhm... mebbe. Mebbe Jumper am stronk wizzerd, make bad people go fwoosh! Jumper smart! Yeah, you’ve got a bit of a problem.%%%%You see, you’ll be talking (and writing, and pantomiming...) like that for your entire stay here. Whether it’s because of brain trauma, a damaged larynx or some sort of mad scientist’s experiment gone horribly right, you’ll be unable to communicate in any way that would need more than a single-digit IQ to pull off. You’ll be just as smart as you were before, but good luck convincing anyone of that fact when it’ll be a struggle just to use words with more than two syllables.,,
Phobia,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Recent developments in psychology, phrenology, anthropology and therapeutics have led the men of science in Arcanum to believe that some people are, in fact, incapable of not being afraid! Such ‘phobias’ as they have called these psychological afflictions, are incurable defects within a subject’s brain that leave them cowering in terror when facing the subject of their illogical fears. You have one such phobia, and are absolutely terrified of a relatively common thing found in Arcanum.%%%%Possible examples include agoraphobia, fearing bright light or darkness, a fear of water, technology or magic. These are not the sole options - you may choose a different kind of phobia to possess so long as it is suitably common and detrimental. You may take ‘Phobia’ multiple times, but must choose a different terror for each.%%%%%%Combining multiple Phobias for some sort of overlap is not allowed - each must add an equal amount of discomfort/problems to your life. If you are already afraid of the outdoors, adding a second Phobia to be terrified of rain would not fit, for example, since you’d already be afraid of rain since it’s outside.,,
Shadows,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Trust no one. Conspiracies and half-truths lurk around every corner, and you never know who’s what they say they are and who’s more. For your time here you will suffer from varying levels of paranoia and a severe hatred of secrecy and treason, leaving you with severe difficulties in trusting anyone other than your closest friends. Your wariness might leave you on edge and make it difficult interacting with strangers, but it’s not all bad... after all, there actually are quite a few conspiracies in Arcanum - you’ll just have to sift the real ones from the ‘false alarms’. You might want to check your notes with a few of the people you do trust, though. Otherwise, you could end up murdering the entire Tarantian Industrial Council for running a covert Half-Ogre rape farm, when only some of them are in on the secret.,,
Bane of the World,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Remember that tiny little problem regarding ‘aptitude’ we mentioned above? It’s a bit more of a problem for you. For the duration of your stay in Arcanum, your aptitude in either technology or magic is now fixed at the maximum level... but only when it would be a problem for you. Choose magic, and guns and machinery will come apart in your hands. Choose technology, and your spells fizzle out as they reject your very being. Likewise, staying near your ‘opposite’ will cause problems - you’d better be ready to focus on only one side of the conflict. Should you somehow master enough magic or technology that your aptitude would shift from technology to magic or vice versa, you will immediately flip to that side’s maximum aptitude.%%%%Unlike the innate aptitude you would already experience during your stay here, this affects your out-of-jump abilities as well (i.e. technologies from other settings will go haywire if you chose magic), though these do not affect your aptitude level itself.,,
Gypsy Curse,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Gypsies aren’t considered very threatening by most civilized people in Arcanum, and most consider them little more than superstitious peddlers of magical items. However, this sentiment is rarely everfound in those who’ve actually crossed a Gypsie. Including you.%%%%You’ve pissed off the wrong someone,and you’ve been cursed with some absolutely godawful bad luck. Creaking floorboards when you’re trying to sneak, saying just the wrong thing to that unusually large Ogre bandit, accidentally dropping that Pyrotechnic Axe on your foot... let’s just say your stay here is going to be a bit problematic at times. Fortunately, it won’t kill you outright if it can just make you miserable instead.,,
Integration,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Your nature as a Jumper means there’s likely a sizable portion of your being that is... well, rather multi-dimensional. But while there are various other realms known to the denizens of Arcanum, such as the Void and the afterlife, none of those are the realities your powers stem from. And now, just as those realms are beyond this world, so too are the abilities you might have claimed in them incompatible with the laws of reality in Arcanum. For the duration of your stay here, you lose access to all out-of-jump advantages you might have had and are effectively reduced to your Body Mod plus whatever purchases you make here. You likewise cannot access your Warehouse.%%%%Integration must be taken by you and your Companions, or by none of you. No mixing.,,
