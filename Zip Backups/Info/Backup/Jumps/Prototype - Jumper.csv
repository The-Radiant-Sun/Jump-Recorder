Gentek Laboratories,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,The Biological and Genetic research facilities that were used to create Redlight and Blacklight viruses. The entire building has incredible security, so the only way you are likely to see any projects going on here is if you are the one doing the researching.,,
Pennsylvania Station,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Ground Zero for the Blacklight virus in New York. Sinew surrounds the building and infected peer at you from every corner.,,

Apartment Complex,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Located in downtown New York this unit features everything you would expect in a tiny apartment, other than your next door neighbor being a genius scientist that works for some kind of biology company. That being said, he left a couple nights ago and has not returned since...,,
Bloodtox Facility: ,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,This factory located in Harlem produces the one thing that infected are weak against, bloodtox. While this is a very important facility for the people, its location is kept under wraps to prevent people like Alex Mercer or other dissidents from potentially destroying one of the best hopes for the city.,,
Times Square,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Ah, times square, one of the most iconic features of New York City. Here there are many daily events and it is actually safe to be in for the most part. Until the infection reaches it, at which point this place becomes hell on earth.,,
Red Crown Command,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,The headquarters of the military for the time being, guarded by thousands of Marines and Blackwatch troops. Expect a visit from a very angry man with a very angry stick sometime  soon.,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You wake up in the starting location with a specialized invitation to join a group known as Blackwatch. You have less than an hour to attend and sign on should you wish to join.%%%%Your age is 1d8+3d8,,
Scientist,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,Looks like those years in grad school finally paid off! You have been granted a cushy research job at Gentek to help them research classified projects that you probably do not know of! On the plus side, you have ready access to some highly classified things ranging from advanced technology to biological compounds, on the down side your workplace is not going to be winning any ethical awards, and you have been working here for a while.%%%%Your age is 1d8+25,,
Hive,,0,,2000,,False,,False,,August 8, 1968, Elizabeth Greene became a nexus for the Redlight Virus in Hope, Idaho as a result of Blackwatch scientists testing different viruses on the civilians. After her infection she spread the virus to the residents which mutated into abominations that defended her without rest, until they were destroyed and she was captured. You were infected with the Redlight virus the same way she was, only you were able to escape.%%%%Your age is 1d8+57%%%%Infected are capable of creating clothing out of their own biomass, possess any sensory adaptation present in animals, detect infections of any kind, glide from walls, absorb biomass  for future use, consuming flesh which turns into usable biomass almost instantly, rapid full body regeneration at the cost of burning through large chunks of biomass, wall-running, superhuman strength, and  can infect others by puncturing their flesh. And of course, change your colors and patterns to any natural kind.,,
Runner,,0,,2000,,True,,True,,Somehow, someway you have contracted the Blacklight virus that Mercer created, while you lack the hive abilities of the Redlight virus, your strength and regeneration are far superior to them.%%Your age is 1d8+20%%%%Infected are capable of creating clothing out of their own biomass, possess any sensory adaptation present in animals, detect infections of any kind, glide from walls, absorb biomass  for future use, consuming flesh which turns into usable biomass almost instantly, rapid full body regeneration at the cost of burning through large chunks of biomass, wall-running, superhuman strength, and  can infect others by puncturing their flesh. And of course, change your colors and patterns to any natural kind.,,
SHTF Sensors,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free for Drop In%%%%This world is not exactly dangerous, but things can escalate into gruesome scenarios  rather quickly, leaving you little time to prepare or to brace yourself for it. You have been gifted an innate sense of when things will go south for you with enough time to pack your bags and get out. This also functions for smaller effects, like knowing when a tentacle will burst from a wall, or anything that could catch you off guard.,,
Keep Your Cool,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,100 CP for Drop In%%%%If there is one thing that will get you killed faster than anything else while fighting off mindless hordes, its losing your calm flailing blindly. But you seem to lack that, and can stay level headed even if you are facing off against someone that is much stronger than you are, and in addition to that you will be able to instantly identify any weak point in your target, and know the best way to exploit it.,,
Not a Hypochondriac,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,200 CP for Drop In%%%%No longer will you need to wash yourself to get rid of germs and pathogens, for years of living in filth has made you immune to all natural pathogens, and any that are similar to the Blacklight virus. Ew.,,
Super Soldier,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,300 CP for Drop In%%Cannot be taken by Infected.%%%%Through testing your DNA the researchers found out that you are compatible with a modified version of the Redlight virus; This grants you great strength and endurance and helps with mental functions as well.%%%%If taken as Drop-In, an opportunity to join Blackwatch as a private is offered. You are weak to everything Prototypes are (save  for Bloodtox; which you are immune to), but much less likely to be on the receiving end of them.,,
Are You Positive?,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free for Scientist%%%%Every scientist has those days where you run a sequence of tests only to yield a false result through some unknown means. You are an exception however, you know whether a test result is either a false positive or negative without needing to run a follow up test to check yourself.,,
Ethics?,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,100 CP for Researcher%%%%Why should a perfectly good specimen go to waste? So long as it is for “ Science” , abduction of individuals will be overlooked by local and federal law enforcement as long as you keep quiet  about the actual testing being done. Do keep in mind that the family will definitely remember their mother getting kidnapped on thanksgiving day, and will likely try and expose you if they can.,,
Toxicology,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,200 CP for Scientist%%%%The Blackwatch can not keep hiding all the good stuff for themselves! Through some highly illegal means you managed to obtain information on Bloodtox and some of the other poisonous projects that have been hidden from public eye.%%%%This can be used in later jumps to quickly determine ways to target a single organism to create a highly effective toxin against them, or by creating technology that has their most well-known aspect of it as a function.,,
Virologist,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,300 CP for Scientist%%%%Looking at it from a technical standpoint, viruses are just devices that carry genes, they enter the nucleus, insert their genome, and then the host cell does everything else for them. This  characteristic makes viruses one of the most favored device in genetic engineering, as they can go and infect multiple cells. The folks at Gentek know this, and focus solely on them, but you have a leg up on them. By extensive study, but still far less than a computer could, you can decode the entire genome of a life-form, and isolate the genes responsible for any and every trait that they possess. Want the eyes  of a goat on the body of a snake? Or possibly just the strength of a rhinoceros? Do not look away, study and decode today!,,
Insectoid Efficiency,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free for Hive%%%%Infected tend to scramble, running around and spreading to the closest tar- get like a cancer. While this tactic may be useful against a large horde of otherwise defenseless targets,  if you are trying to infect more intelligent or advanced species you will need organization. With this perk your hive and everything controlled by it will set up a system similar to insects, where there are distinct roles for each unit that they will follow until you tell them otherwise. With each hive built the complexity of your unit strategies will increase as well.,,
Convergence,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,100 CP for Hive%%%%Depending on how far-out your infection has spread, getting a large number of min- ions to your side might take some time, which can lead to you being in a pinch when there is no one to guard  you. No longer is that the case! With this perk you can summon all the infected that you control to your position at once, and they will move at incredible speeds to reach you, even if you are hidden in prison! If  you are not infected, then this perk instead will work the same way for any allies that are undyingly loyal to you.,,
Allowance,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,200 CP for Hive%%%%In most cases minion consumed biomass will stay with them, and would be digested. This is not the case for you however, infected minions that consume targets will give you a small portion of the biomass consumed without having to come into contact with them for you to use, this does not come without a compromise however. Taking the biomass from a minion also means that the minion will need to eat more to compensate for this. This does work both ways as well...,,
True Hive Mind,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,300 CP for Hive%%%%If you are trying to control a massive hive, it is going to take a lot of effort to control them, especially if you have your own body. With this perk you will be able to dissolve your body and transfer your ” essence” to your hive, where the  only way to kill you is by destroying all of the hives you have under control. But hives are completely sessile, so you will be unable  to escape should someone invade your hives and destroy them. This also grants greater control to your hive, where you are able to execute attacks and strategies like they are chess pieces, and allows access to any of your powers, as long as they do not allow you to move the location of any hive. If you want your body back it will take a full week to form, and a large amount of biomass to create it.,,
Predator,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free for Runner%%%%Humans have become dulled to their instincts; no longer can they compete with feral  beasts in hunting, instead they compensate with technology to find their targets. But technology is fickle, and requires maintenance to use for extended periods of time. No longer will you be bound to such devices that block your senses, you have gained an animalistic accuracy with your senses to the point where you  could outcompete a bloodhound for scents, and you have developed some extra senses that other animals have as well, like sonar and other commonly known senses.,,
Deerish,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,100 CP for Runner%%%%Deer, Rabbits, Squirrels. All of these animals are so weak, and yet they managed to spread their genes across the world. The reason they can is because they have an almost supernatural sense of predation, but yours is far superior. You will be able to detect individuals actively trying to kill you within a mile radius, and with training can increase that distance even further.,,
The Taste of Memories,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,200 CP for Runner%%%%Memories, what a beautiful thing. Despite them only being measured in millivolts they hold everything that someone has ever done or felt, and yet, they disappear without a trace when  the signals stop. No longer will experience be lost through time, for consuming a small portion of someone's brain after killing them allows you to access every memory that they have ever had, and their knowledge as well.,,
What Makes Me Unique,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,300 CP for Runner%%%%In case you did not know this already,  if you are infected in this world you are no longer the implied human that you were before coming here, instead you ARE the Blacklight or Redlight virus you were infected with. Most people might  go insane or lose their sense of “ self” after consuming thousands of people, but youre different. You will always be “ you” no  matter what form you are in, and will always be lucid with your decisions.%%%%In addition to this, because you have embraced the fact  that you are no longer human you can do so much more with your powers. Powers that are biological in origin are much more effective when used, and you are able to assimilate the powers of other forms of infection to suit your needs.,,
My Mistake,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,People don not seem to think much about you, do they? Whether being in restricted areas or private property if you get caught trespassing and there is no alert and you have not triggered an alarm, you can safely leave the area by apologizing and walking out.,,
Advanced Networking,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Proxies? Firewalls? Maybe to a novice they offer some semblance of protection, but you you those things are pointless, especially when they leave such a nice back door for you to  take.,,
Virus Creator,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,With this perk you will now have the ability to purchase from the HIVE tree if you are a non-infected with 600PP. You cannot buy special infected, nor can you purchase the “ Eye See You” effect. You will be able to convert CP into PP the same as infected can. You will be granted a box of 12 vials that contain these effects, and each one respawns in the warehouse 1 week after use.,,
Counter-Intuition,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Infected? There is a reason that the infection has not spread to nearby states, and that is because you have made devices that can sniff and snuff them out even a mile away whether they are in air, land, or sea!%%%%This allows you to make weapons and vehicles to exploit any weakness of your foes that you are aware of and be used to counter any specific biological threat that you may come across.,,
Infected Master,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Through some means, your voice can pacify, even redirect infected. While this only works for individuals starting out, with training, you can eventually control large swathes of infected at a time.%%%%Works post-jump on similar infected or mutated beings as well.,,
AESTHETICS,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Free for Hive and Runner%%%%While I personally love the look of the infected, you might disagree with me and think that they are hideous and need a makeover. With this power you  can change the look of any unit, as long as they are still the same size and that the new look does not make them more deadly than they are already.,,
Node Creator,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free for Hive and Runner%%%%You did not think you could create infected without a chamber for them to grow in, did you? The initial purchase grants you the ability to create a hive by consuming biomass, which can initially create Infected one at a time. But with each additional purchase the time required to “ grow” new infected lowers by two-thirds, and you can grow twice as many as you did before.%%%%Can be purchased multiple times.,,
Substance Release,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Once whatever guards you have placed have been taken out your hive or other structures are completely defenseless! However with this upgrade you can create nodes that can hinder or even harm non-infected that enter its radius. Possible effects that can be done are sleep and paralysis, but anything is possible!,,
Spores,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,I do not know about you, but I do not like the idea of having to physically injure a specimen in order to infect it. At your discretion, your infected can now secrete spores that enter the hosts respiratory system in order to infect them. How convenient! Comes in your choice of appearance, from a dust cloud to a thick mist that obscures vision.,,
Eye See You,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are no longer human, so limiting where you can take sensory information from to only yourself is silly, is it not? You have achieved a great link with your hive, and can now share sensory information between different individuals in your hive, allowing you to sense the world from all of your eyes.,,
Terra Infection,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Humans are the bread and butter of the mindless horde genre, which gets really old after a few decades of watching. With this you will be able to spread your gift to any life-form that evolved on earth.,,
Alien Lifeforms,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Requires Terra Infection%%%%Why stop with Earth life when there are galaxies to explore? With this perk your virus will be able to spread to any life-form that you can think of! Though infecting things that do not operate based on cells will take a lot of time to finally begin infection,,
Teamwork,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Lets face it, mindless hordes are worse at cooperating than humans are, which is saying a lot since people do not like working with others either. Your infected can now coordinate attacks and can pull off basic strategies in order to capture, kill, or otherwise attack their target.,,
Biofilm,,1,,-1500,,True,,True,,The virus seemed to have taken up a trait from bacteria, and your non-motile biomass, hives, and other similar things, can spew out more and are much harder to remove than normal, even exhibiting some resistance to bloodtox!,,
Pathogen Participation,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The Blacklight and Redlight viruses do not seem to play well with other kinds of infection, shown by the fact that you never see someone with one having another kind of illness. With this perk, your virus can incorporate aspects of any other infection that you have become a part of, and can be used in your minions as well.,,
Jumpy,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Infected usually take the shortest distance to the target, and while that is great for slow moving targets, faster or well armed targets can line up shots rather easily on your infected. But with this your infected will move erratically, making it almost impossible to track their movements.,,
Hypothermia,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Brrr, did someone lower the thermostat again? Your infected are displaying a peculiar trait that is almost unheard of, and are rapidly cooling themselves somehow while still being functional. While this is great if you want to spread around the desert, it can also be used to freeze enemies upon extended contact.,,
Hyperthermia,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Is it hot in here, or is it just me? Your infected are running so much blood through their systems so fast that it rapidly heats their bodies, scalding anyone who is foolish enough to touch them. Both Hypo and Hyperthermia can be purchased, and your infected units can alter between the two states at any time.,,
Increased Strength,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,No matter what the situation is, having units that can run faster and deal more damage is always appreciated.,,
Increased Durability,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It seems your infected have adapted to all of the violence, and are now capable of taking in much more damage than before.,,
Hive - Walkers,,1,,00,,False,,True,,A step above the basic infected, walkers can dismember a marine in one strike, and can take a grenade or two before falling. While they are much stronger that the basic infected, they are still weaker than any purchasable choice here.,,
Hive - Flyers,,1,,00,,False,,True,,These infected are the only ones shown to be of species other than human, and are large enough to pick up a fully grown man and dropping him off in the air.,,
Hive - Hunters,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,Large quadrupedal creatures that still look human, these creatures dwarf humans while on all fours and run like an angered monkey. While they are very close relatives to brawlers, they are still much weaker than them.,,
Hive - Hunter - Leader Hunter,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,These infected dwarf most vehicles, and are almost the same size as the large-class infected. They are capable of leading other hunters as a pack and singling out targets to kill.,,
Hive - Brawler,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Aggressive beasts that resemble a lizard, these infected are the most tenacious, and are capable of catching up to fast moving vehicles to slaughter the prey inside. They are incredibly strong and can take most small arms fire without losing their momentum.,,
Hive - Brawler - Spike Brawler,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Spiked brawlers, also called Brawler hunters are much bulkier and aesthetic than their normal counterpart. With its immense strength it is capable of causing shockwaves by shaking the ground underneath it and even throwing large pieces of concrete capable of hitting helicopters!,,
Hive - Goliath,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Enormous infected with tiny legs and two uneven arms, these guys can leap around like an angry gorilla. They are one of the strongest infected, able to move at blistering speeds in short bursts but also swing its left arm around like a club and its right one like a scythe. While it does have a large amount of health, it is very susceptible to fire or other non-kinetic based damage as it seems to have no skin over a large portion of its body.,,
Hive - Juggernaut,,1,,-1500,,False,,True,,This infected is built for one thing, and one thing only. Destruction. Juggernauts have the most health out of any normal infected, and is capable of throwing cars and smashing giant gates down. While it would take a few rockets at the very least to bring one of these things down, it is also one of the slowest infected, needing to be escorted so that it can actually reach its destination without being torn apart from concentrated enemy fire.,,
Hive - Juggernaut - Alpha Juggernaut,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,A big guy even for you, this juggernaut is more than a cut above the rest. Besides being larger, stronger, and having better durability than its normal counterpart, this one also excretes a noxious gas to incapacitate your enemies, and can create devastating Line of Sight attacks that rupture the very earth beneath it, similar to the ground-spikes that runner claws can create.,,
Hive - Hydra,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Massive tentacles erupting from wherever they are planted, these things are like urban weed whackers, capable of demolishing small buildings and weakening others. While they are capable of reaching low flying helicopters, the part that comes out to attack is only a small portion, and the actual body lives below ground.,,
Hive - Evolved,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,The “ officers” of Alex Mercers army in the second game, evolved are drastically different from the other infected because they are able to think for themselves and show it with their boosted intellect. These infected are a special kind, they have almost the same powers that runners do, except they are still tied to your hive unless they possess a very rare defect that only one person has ever exhibited. Of course, you have a much greater control over your infection, so the only way someone could break free like that was if you really wanted them to.,,
Consume+,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,The most horrifying aspect of the infection is their ability to swallow similar sized organisms whole by rapidly digesting and absorbing the victims biomass, adding it to their own, and taking their skills and form. While this cannot grant you the strength of superman, absorbing a creature will grant you with a minor change to your abilities based on what they excelled in.,,
Canon Weapon,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Runners have the ability to create melee weapons from the biomass that they have consumed, ranging from the simple blade arm to the grappling whipfist. Purchasing this allows you access to all of the formed weapons instead of just one.,,
Canon Weapon - Non-Canon Weapon,,1,,-250,,True,,False,,If you want a weapon that was not in the prototype series, like a rapier, then you can spend points here to have that form available from the start.,,
Canon Weapon - Runner Rounds,,1,,-250,,True,,True,,Of course, why limit yourself to only melee weapons when there are birds in the sky? Now you can turn parts of your body into various sorts of biomass consuming launchers. A pistol? Sure! A shotgun? You bet!,,
Stored Mass,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,By using up your stored biomass you can temporarily increase your maximum health and damage resistance.,,
Bio-Bomb,,1,,-500,,False,,True,,Maybe you do not have the time to individually slaughter a squad, or maybe you just do not want to, either way you are able to use biomass to infect a portion of your own flesh to explode, to throw at a target, or embed it in a target and have them explode.,,
Armour,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,By consuming biomass you will be able to increase the amount of damage you can resist. The biomass will harden across your body, greatly reducing incoming damage, but will also hinder your movement by the same degree.,,
Transform,,1,,-1500,,True,,True,,Turning into humans is not terrible, but maybe you want to shape-shift into different forms you have not consumed, or maybe make your own. With this power you can shape-shift your body at will, and can freely combine alt-forms as well. This does not grant any extra power however.,,
Excessive Force,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Because why stop at adequate? Excessive force grants a boost to all of your physical, and infected abilities. So now armor that could take less than a .50 cal round can now take up to a missile in order to be damaged.,,
Regeneration,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Infected can recover from any injury, so long as enough a noticeable organ remains. By purchasing this perk you would need to be reduced to a size less than a small puddle of blood to be destroyed if you someone were to wish for you to truly die.,,
Bloodtox Rounds,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A new project that is secret to even the Blackwatch, these special rounds will rapidly break down the tissues of any being that is “ infected” and slowly poison those who are not. Comes with 12 rounds that seem to bleed into other rounds that are touching it.,,
Viral Detector,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,When you are too paranoid or too lazy to search for infected without assistance, this lightweight device can detect any infected within 600m of it! Since each universe has a different variant of this, the device will add in similar beings to its scanners as well. If you do not like its default range I am sure it would not take long to improve it.,,
Armoury,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,More than a few guns, this armory addition to the warehouse has enough weapons to outfit 100 men, and includes 12 thermobaric launchers.,,
Armoury - Specialty Rounds,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This armory will also have an almost infinite cache of Bloodtox, Thermobaric, and Sinew Rounds!,,
Nuke,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Sometimes you just want to watch the world burn, and what better way to start the fire than with your very own WMD? Just be careful, launching it would certainly attract a large amount of attention if it was found out that you launched it, or possibly even a war if someone thinks it was the work of another nation instead.%%%%Respawns every 2 months.,,
Thermobaric Rounds,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A relatively new development by Blackwatch, these rounds function as what you’d expect a thermobaric missile to, but in a 6m radius. You originally start off with 3 of them, but having them touch other bullets the effect will spread to those as well.,,
Whitelight,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,The hope for mankind that Alex Mercer would have eventually destroyed, this strain of Whitelight is incorruptible, and can safely remove the symptoms of infected from anyone that is “infected” with it. It seems to also become sentient after infecting enough individuals, gaining powers similar to a runner.,,
All Access Pass,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,VIP scientists always get special treatment and it is for a good reason, they have knowledge to die for. You can enter any research facility at will without repercussions so long as that you are not actively hostile to them and that you do not intentionally damage the property. You gotta show them the card too, that is pretty important. Comes in your choice of material, with the words VIP Access printed on it.,,
"Research Vessel",,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You managed to convince your superiors that you need an aquatic research facility to continue experimentation in the case that the main Gentek building gets destroyed. And being the smart person you are, you also managed to siphon funds into making the ship a bit more... habitable. So while it is still equipped for everything a mad scientist would need for their projects, it also has some luxury features that would put a world class yacht to shame.%%%%Comes equipped with an automated guidance system, and hydroponics.,,
"Research Vessel" - Size,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,If the current size is not big enough for you, this one certainly is. This increases the length to 700 feet and the width to 250, and can fit whatever structure you are imagining on it that you would normally see on any boat.,,
"Research Vessel" - Defences,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Adds six AA turrets to your yacht.,,
"Research Vessel" - Armour,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Adds reactive armor to your yacht.,,
"Research Vessel" - Anti-Infested,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your boat now has a mounted Bloodtox-thrower.,,
"Research Vessel" - Boomstick,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Adds three Thermobaric artillery pieces,,
Hive & Runner - Sinew Rounds,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,These special bullets will Explode violently into tendrils in a 4m area on impact. You initially start with 5, but can create more by allowing them to touch other rounds. The rounds can be converted back to normal ammo if they are immersed in bloodtox.,,
Stun Baton,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,A telescopic baton with the end tip having a charge capable of incapacitating a runner.,,
Hazmat Armour,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,Modified armor that will be able to protect you from the infection while still catching a few bullets. While it is not indestructible it is however incredibly strong, and will appear in your warehouse should it ever be fully destroyed.,,
Bloodtox Thrower,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Cooler than fire, this strap-on device can launch dense clouds of bloodtox in an arc similar to a flamethrower.,,
Flamethrower,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Kill it with fire!!! If you want to go out in a blaze of glory, or just are too lazy to scrape the ice off your driveway this flamethrower will definitely assist with it. Comes with a built in tank that does not run out, and your choice of color, for the device and the flames.,,
Thermobaric Rocket Launcher,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A special rocket launcher that will pull in the surrounding atmosphere before detonating, making an incredibly deadly explosion that the target has no chance of escape from!,,
APC,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,If you are driving into a hot-zone and trying to protect a VIP, a normal car will not cut it, especially if the hot zone is partially due to infectious spores littering the area. This APC, while slower than a humvee or any other vehicle can provide protection up to .50 cal rounds, and completely prevents the inside air from contaminants.,,
Helicopter,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,Because driving around streets that resemble a colon more than a city would feel at least a little uncomfortable, this helicopter offers a variety of weapons to leisurely kill weaker infected, so long as nothing decides to throw something at you.,,
Helicopter - Armament Upgrade,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,Now we are talking, thermobaric launchers and increased armor so that you will be able to take a hit or two and keep flying.,,
Tank,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,If you are planning on assaulting a city, its best if you have something on the ground to keep your troops safe... and to blast the larger infected. This baby can take a hit, and certainly knows how to bring the pain as well.,,
Tank - Armament Upgrade,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,New York is a dangerous place, so I understand why you would want more protection. This upgrade gives your tank heavier armor, so that the only thing that can damage it would be Large class infected and above, and also has its main turret replaced with a thermobaric cannon, so that you can make those guys even more dead!,,
USS Ronald Reagan,,2,,-8000,,True,,True,,Maybe you fucked up big time and the entire North American continent is infected, or maybe you want to pick a fight with a small island nation, regardless of your intentions this modern carrier will be able to assist you with them. Besides all of the facilities and weapons it normally has, it also comes equipped with 5 VTOL Jets and 3 helicopters, any upgrades added will stay with it between jumps.
