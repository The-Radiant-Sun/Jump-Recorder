Name,,Type,,CP Change,,Active,,Chained,,Description,,Notes
Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You will begin in...somewhere in Japan! It’s a very nice town, this place in Japan; it’s got an aquarium, a nice selection of cafes owned by a rather rich local family, beautifully scenic views, and a very good highschool that you’ll be attending if you’re a Student. It also happens to occasionally have a festival-so look forwards to that!%%%%No matter your origin, your gender is the same as last jump-or, you may freely choose to swap to female given the overwhelmingly female cast.,,
Highschool Student,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You’ve just entered the world of Highschool, out of your childish middle school days and becoming the person you were meant to be. You’re fourteen years old, and have your whole life ahead of you.,,
Cat,,0,,00,,False,,True,,You’re a cat! You can freely choose to be any purely mundane cat, or pay 50 CP to import a feline species to become from your previous jumps-this is a purely cosmetic choice though, granting you no special traits or abilities. You are 1d4 years old, and cute as a button!,,
Nyanko!,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Cats in this world look a bit...different from what you’re used to. Put simply, cats universally look like excessively tiny, chibi cat girls. They all have cute outfits matching their personalities, hair that matches their fur color, the works-even stray cats. It’s just the way things work in this world, but if you’d like to keep it or even apply it to other species you’ll need to pay 100 CP.%%%%Do note; this does not increase the intelligence, hygiene, or habits of affected species, nor does it decrease or affect their innate abilities-a humanized tiger will still try to rip your face off if you startle it, and will have the claws to do so.,,
Cat Whisperer,,1,,00,,False,,True,,It’s a bit interesting, but cats seem to be able to hold complex conversations in this world. Or is it that the people can just understand cats? Either or both ways, this perk serves to emphasize that trait; in jump it comes standard and applies directly and only to cats.%%%%By paying 200 CP however, you may take this trait onwards into your chain and even learn to talk to other species-if they happen to be willing to play along with you, at least.%%%%It’s important to note that this does not affect the animals you talk to, only granting you the capacity to communicate with them. In this world all cats seem capable of holding complex thoughts and motivations, but elsewhere animals will retain their innate intelligence-or lack thereof-making this a rather situational skill.,,
Clever Kitty,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You’ll notice that the cats of this world aren’t exactly like the cats of the normal world, even barring their humanized chibi forms. They can talk to their owners, have complex thoughts and emotions, imagine themselves in different outfits-and in one notable cat’s case, even read and write just as well as any human being. These cats are smart, no two ways about it, but for the most part that’s just how this world works. It’s also a bit odd, but the rest of the world is just the same even with how smart cats happen to be here.%%%%You can carry this animal intellect forwards if you want for 300 CP, but a few important things to note once you do. The world might be the same in spite of how intelligent cats here are, but this might not hold true elsewhere. Further, this perk manifests as a choice in each jump-make a given species intelligent, or not? And once that choice is made, there’s no taking it back-the box has been opened, as it were. Animals, whether you choose that to be cats or some other species, will become intelligent once this is done, but fundamentally they’ll still be the same animals. That means that even with newfound intellect a cat will still have cat-based motivations and personality traits, a dog will still be dog-like, and so on.,,
Student - First, We Need To Finely Chop The Vegetables,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Trying new things can be pretty difficult. When you have no idea what you’re truly doing, it might feel like you end up doing everything wrong from the start. Luckily, so long as you have a clear set of instructions, you can follow through! It doesn’t matter if you’ve never cooked anything more complicated than ramen before, if you’ve got the cookbook in front of you you’ll be able to make an omelette!%%%%Though, as a fair note, doing everything by the book will lead to a textbook example of whatever you do-no better and no worse. Further, if you’re trying something that’s wildly out of your capabilities or whatever you’re trying to do is impossible, no set of instructions can overcome that.,,
Student - Love and Affection,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Caring for pets isn’t all playing around and cuddling. There’s quite a few other things involved as well-from grooming, keeping them clean, picking up after them, training, and more. It’s a relief you’re rather good at picking up those skills. You can easily learn the habits of your pets, figuring out how to care for them, keep them well groomed, and even where best to pet them to make them happiest.%%%%This only works on your pets mind you, and sometimes your pets happen to be little weirdos that like being tickled under the arms while others of their species hate that.%%%%On the other hand your little friends will appreciate your care for them and love you all the more for it, and some general ideas for dealing with the same species might carry over.,,
Student - It’s Really Tasty!,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sometimes you put all your love, affection, and effort into something...and it just doesn’t come out all that well. That’s okay though, nobody will mind. In fact, they’ll care more about the effort and emotion you put into the act than the end result so long as it isn’t truly disastrous. If you happen to make an omelette for your cats that’s deformed and has flies flying around it, don’t worry-they’ll love it anyways because of the love you made it with.%%%%This has its limits, if you do something truly horrible, it’s not going to be overlooked no matter your intentions.,,
Student - Every Day, Every Night,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,No matter what, life has a way of grinding at people. Day in and day out the rigors of school, relationships, drama, and other things can really tire a person out. But you’ve got a secret to keep you going-you’ve got a few friends back home who will never judge you and are always there for you. By keeping your pets in your heart your pets will do the same, loving you just as much if not more than you love them. Further, their love makes getting through every day just that much easier, making the tedious and draining tasks of life just that much more bearable with their encouragement. You do need to actually have pets for this to work, mind you, and further you have to genuinely care for said pets. Going through the motions just adds a new task to daily life rather than relieving one’s burdens.,,
Student - Friends at First Sight,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,There’s something about you...Perhaps it’s the cute cat hair clips you wear? Or is it that innocent light in your eyes? There’s no one thing that truly stands out with this, but people will find you more charming regardless. Someone completely neutral to you can take one look at you and decide “I want to be their friend.” while someone who treats you as a rival can find themselves falling into a more friendly role with a bit of encouragement. Someone well and truly hostile to you can easily ignore this, but short of that your casual charm is truly something to behold.,,
Student - Let’s Go For A Walk,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,When you’re bored and have nothing better to do, why not go for a walk with your pets? Certainly, you’ll be able to find something to relieve that boredom-and perhaps even more. From now on whenever you go out with your friends or pets in order to genuinely enjoy yourself without expectation of prizes or such, you’ll find that you stumble across rather lucky coincidences. Perhaps that park you visited just happens to be owned by a cute rich girl who’s taken a liking to you?%%%%Further, this luck improves the more your pets or companions are wholesomely enjoying their time out with you, up to a reasonable limit. This only really works with personal groups of friends or pets, fading away if you just bring a mob out or the like.,,
Student - There You Are!,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,When you’re lost and afraid, always remember: you’re not alone. Your friends are your strengths, and your bonds with them let you accomplish more than the sum of their parts. Through your bonds of friendship and the love of your pets, you’ll find yourself able to overcome any obstacle or goal to a reasonable limit.%%%%This won’t improve your skills, strengths, or the like-instead, it will simply make it so that coincidence and luck line up to let you through and achieve victory.%%%%Further, if something’s impossible then there’s no getting around that with just this. Always remember that there’s a limit to luck even if your bonds run deep, a school girl isn’t going to come first in the Olympics on pure luck after all.,,
Student - School Idol,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Amongst all your classmates, you really do stand head and shoulders above the rest, you know? Your skin is flawless, your hair lustrous, a beautiful shine in your eyes, and a body to die for. Even more, you’ve got an effortless sort of perfection that lets you easily score 100% on six exams in a row as long as you’ve done the bare minimum of studying and stay in shape well enough to be able to run a marathon and come in the top five, if not first place-by pacing yourself well. You’re the envy of your peers no matter where you go.%%%%This doesn’t boost your speed, strength, or intellect to absurdity-you simply stand head and shoulders above the average, though nowhere near the peak. In a place like this that’s enough to stand above all others, but in places where the average is far below the peak of what’s possible it’d be wise to watch out.%%%%Optionally also comes with pink hair and...rather enhanced bust.,,
Cat - Cute Kitty Cat,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,There’s no other way to put it, you’re freaking adorable. Tiny, squishy, and absurdly cuddly, a tiny yawn or smile from you will make every school girl in a ten foot radius squeal in delight. Also comes with a chibi form, for maximum adorableness.%%%%This provides essentially no benefit aside from being cute-granting no added charisma or the like-and people who are hostile to you don't care how adorable you are, but being cute is worth it. Plus, you’ll never have to worry about fleas, parasites, mud, or the like-you’re just naturally clean!,,
Cat - Kitty Pile,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Cats are very touchy creatures, at least in this world. And what I mean by that, is that they’re very eager to touch and be touched. Cuddling, pets, bathing each other, jumping into their master’s arms and more. There’s nothing more comfortable than just piling together into a big ball of fur to sleep on their master-and now, you can carry that same feeling wherever you go.%%%%People will be willing to casually touch, cuddle, or go along with your more physical games than usual up to a point-this won’t lead to anything lewd or the like if they weren’t up for that previously, only allow you to easily get away with more casual cuddling and such.,,
Cat - Cats Get Lonely,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Time alone can be a burden when so much of your life revolves around your friends and companions. At the same time though you can’t just hog all of their time for yourself-they have things they need to do as well, after all. Luckily, you’ve found your patience has grown to handle long waits, especially when you know that those you love will be coming back in due time. And in the meantime?%%%%You’re great at finding ways to entertain yourself that always conveniently finish themselves up just before your loved ones return to you. Just...try not to make a huge mess while they’re away, okay?,,
Cat - This Looks Fun!,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sometimes though, you end up causing a bit of a mess even without intending to. It’s not your fault, you were just having fun and all the sudden the entire room looks like a tornado went through it! Worry not, though; as long as you genuinely didn’t intend harm and didn’t do something too horrible, people are willing to happily look past it. Sure you might not exactly be trusted to be alone in a room with loads of stray papers after such an incident, but you’ll still be loved and cared for just as much as before. Again, this requires that you genuinely didn’t intend any harm in your actions. Further, it’s not going to garner forgiveness if you do something genuinely horrible that can’t be fixed.,,
Cat - Humans Sure Have It Rough,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It’s a good thing you aren’t one, isn’t it? Humans have all sorts of responsibilities, expectations, chores...luckily, none of that affect your magnificent feline self! You can laze around all day and walk up to your owner, and you’ll receive praise and pets purely for existing-after all, nobody expects a cat to do homework.%%%%By acting in-line with or having others expect a far lower level of capability from yourself than those around you, you can “duck under” all those responsibilities or expectations that others have to deal with and still reap disproportionately large rewards for your far lesser efforts. It’s impressive enough to just be yourself after all.%%%%If you happen to display far higher levels of capability too consistently though, don’t be surprised when people’s expectations of what you can actually do start rising and new responsibilities start landing in your lap.,,
Cat - I’m Not Sure a Cat Should Be Doing This,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,But it is pretty interesting, the way some cats in this world just casually do things that should be flat out impossible for them and nobody takes any real note of it. Reading manga and practicing katakana are pretty absurd hobbies for a kitten after all, but nobody seems to notice!%%%%You carry this aura of casual disinterest around you as well, people glossing over your actions and capabilities as long as you remain fairly low-key about it and don’t actively flaunt it. Someone who’s particularly perceptive and looking out for unusual things about yourself will see through this fairly easily, but otherwise nobody’s going to really notice or care about a cat that just so happens to be reading a physics book.,,
Cat - There’s A Cat On The Bus!,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have a goal and you’re going to see it through, that is that. And when you decide on your goal, it’s as if Lady Luck herself hears you and complies. All those issues and obstacles that would normally make achieving your goal nearly impossible just...fix themselves. If you’re locked in a house with no way out, a door will miraculously be unlocked. You’ll arrive at a bus stop just as a bus rides up and a tour group is boarding. The doors to an aquarium that doesn’t allow cats will just happen to be stuck open because of said tour group.%%%%This won’t get rid of every issue, mind you, instead aligning circumstances in a highly unlikely but possible series of events. Further, the greater the issues this perk has to deal with, the less effective it is-no weaving through bullets because they all miss.,,
Cat - Endless Nyanko Days,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Because everything has to end someday, no matter how much we might not like it. But maybe...you can hold onto these peaceful, happy days just a little bit longer. Once you find that feeling of peace and happiness that you want to hold onto...you can. As long as you wish, you can have those “Nyanko Days” last as long as you like, varying a little here and there but largely holding steady and true to your desires.%%%%This won’t allow you to change the genre of whatever setting you go into, nor could it stop something truly monumental from forcibly ending the happy days you experience. Further, you need to find that feeling of what you wish to keep experiencing before you can keep it going.,,
An Endless Supply of String,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The original pet toy, and something that can keep kids occupied for hours on end. This fluffy white string is endless fun for both cats and humans! A few notes though; it’s fairly fragile, so if it’s pulled at both ends too hard it’ll just rip apart. Further, if you try to twine it into rope for greater strength it’ll just unravel. It’s kinda useless outside of having fun.,,
Student - A Good Pen,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A good, shiny pen. It doesn’t seem to run out of ink, and the tip will never get sticky or stop writing suddenly. Very useful for writing essays!,,
Student - A Bag of Snacks,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Choose a common snack item; this bag happens to hold it. It’s not exactly infinite, but if you look away or stop eating from it you’ll find that it’s full again. Further, if you don’t think about how much you’re eating or the fact that you’re eating from it, it’ll just never seem to run out. Careful not to eat too much!,,
Student - Cute Hair Clips,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A stylish and super-cute pair of hairclips themed after an animal of your choice. They’ll sparkle in the sunlight and really emphasize your cute points, and you’ll find it a bit easier to make friends while wearing them.,,
Student - Cute Outfits For All Occasions,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,But why have just one cute accessory, when you can have a whole wardrobe? These clothes happen to be perfectly mundane in every way, but cute and stylish at the same time. Further, you can find a good outfit for literally any occasion you can think of! Many a highschool girl would sell their soul to get a wardrobe like this, treasure it well.,,
Student - One Stop Beauty Salon,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,People will believe you’re hiding a whole beauty salon in your bathroom with this item, at least. Eyeliner, lipstick, blush, foundation-any makeup item you can think of, this kit’s got it and more along with instructions on how to easily apply or remove it. It also comes with a selection of shampoos, hair conditioners, skin creams, and other such beauty products that’ll make you the envy of your peers. Always remember: for most, beauty is a skill rather than a trait. With this set of products, even a weak 6 could look like a solid 8 and 1?2.,,
Student - A Really Good TV Remote,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Durable, lightweight, and easily programmed to work with just about any TV, this is honestly just a really good TV remote.%%%%You don’t ever seem to have to change the batteries on it, either. Interestingly enough, TVs it’s been programmed to work with will always be able to reach a few specific channels; generic news programs, nature documentaries, and a variety of programs aimed to keep one’s pets entertained-such as Kitty Calisthenics, which keeps cats occupied and helps them keep in shape!,,
Student - Academic Notebook,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The singular best item in the world for those struggling in school: a notebook full of notes, practice problems, and space to work on it.%%%%Seriously speaking though, this notebook will always have general academic information in it for studying, plenty of practice problems to work on in relation to whatever academic information you look up, and empty space to solve said problems. The notebook itself will even grade you, pointing out where you go wrong without actually giving away the solution so you can figure it out for yourself and grow smarter for it. It never seems to run out of pages, and when using it you’ll find that it’ll be somewhat easier to focus and organize your thoughts than normal.%%%%And of course, you can also write down your own knowledge or problems into it like you would an ordinary study notebook.,,
Student - A Real Bourgeois,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,There’s no other way to say it-you come from old money. Your dad owns every coffee shop in town, and you can eat there for free whenever you like. Other people take buses or walk to places, while you ride in limos. Your backyard is large enough to be mistaken for a public park. Your allowance looks like some people’s yearly income. Whether you flaunt that money or live humbly in spite of it is up to you, but it’s important to keep in mind that this isn’t infinite even if it’s absurd, and your money comes from your family rather than yourself. Keep up the good grades, or your allowance might drop a zero!,,
Cat - Cat Items,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Perfectly adorable little outfits for a cute little cat(girl) to wear! Stylish, fitting, and comfy whether they’re over skin or fur, these are perfect for dressing up a pet in to make them just that much more adorable. And for those with a silly personality, there’s even shirts that have little faces or messages that change randomly or depending on your mood!,,
Cat - Kitty Biscuits,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The pet food of champions. They universally taste incredible to pets, like tiny little slices of heaven, though they’re not very nutritious. Even better, the box never seems to run out-always refilling after closing the lid for even a moment! Be careful not to feed your pet too many, or they might get chubby!,,
Cat - Cat Friendly Drawing Tools,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A set of crayons and non-toxic paints and crayons that are easy to clean up and easy for pets to use. It might take a bit to teach them to only use them in specific places rather than the walls, floor, and ceiling(?!), but once you do they’ll be able to express their creativity and entertain themselves without any further effort-and once they’re done, you can frame their creations and show off what amazing artists your pets are!,,
Cat - Pet Toys,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Whether a squeaky mouse, a length of rope, or something else, these pet toys are durable and entertaining! They’ll easily catch the attention of your pets, and no matter how hard your pets play they’ll still be right as rain after a little wash to clean them up.,,
Cat - Cat Tree,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A fun to climb and very comfy cat tree that instills pets that use it with an almost mystical sense of wonder and fun. It can act as a sleeping place, perch, scratching post, climbing area, hiding place, and more all at once. Despite the name, it’s suitable for any pets you might have. You can bet it’ll end up as your pets favorite place to sleep or play after a while.,,
Cat - No Mess Litter Box,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Taking care of pets can be pretty dirty business, and there’s things about it that people would be better off simply not thinking about at all. That’s why this item exists; for pet owners, it looks like a simple and clean litter box that automatically cleans itself and leaves pets that use it fresh and feeling as if they’ve just been bathed. For pets that use it, or if you happen to be a pet yourself, it looks like a large box with a built in miniature bathroom that takes care of all your needs-and still leaves you feeling like you’ve just been bathed. Surprisingly useful, this litter box. Now you don’t have to think of it ever again!,,
Cat - Kitty Tube of Friendship,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A comfortable and fun cat tube that’s sure to entertain pets for hours on end! It folds out and can extend to be a veritable maze if you like, or collapse back in on itself to easily fit inside a normal backpack.%%%%Best of all, this cat tube has a number of special qualities. No matter what the pet is or how large they happen to be, they’ll all shrink down to the size of a small kitten while inside this tube where they can then play around as they please.%%%%Its greatest quality, though, is that it is a Kitty Tube of Friendship; while inside it, pets and animals will easily find themselves putting their differences aside and becoming friends and playmates. This friendship will persist even once they leave the tube. It’s important to note that the animals inside must at least be neutral to each other or have some pre-existing friendship; a feral snake isn’t going to suddenly become friends with a mouse if put inside the Kitty Tube.,,
Cat - Kitty Manga,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A series of simple and easy to read picture books with basic storylines and lots of pictures, ranging across every genre you can think of and all packed into a little box with a built-in bookshelf. These books would probably be pretty boring for anyone older than, say, three years old...but interestingly enough, pets seem to love them. If you happen to give a book to one of your pets, then before long they’ll start reading it. And as they read it, their mind will grow somewhat. From base instinct and animal intellect, they’ll grow to true sentience and awareness about at the level of a small child while retaining their loyalty and love to you. Further, their personality will develop in-line with whatever book they were reading; reading a romance book will see that pet developing into an incorrigible romantic, a detective book would see a rather inquisitive personality, and a silly book will make a silly pet. You can also make Kitty Manga copies of other books you own if you like, or use it to grant your companions Nyanko Altforms.,,
Import a Companion,,3,,-500,,False,,True,,If you like, you can take one of your previous Companions with you into this world of cats and schoolgirls. They’ll have their choice of origin as well as 800 CP to spend for themselves on Perks and Items.,,
A Cat,,3,,-500,,False,,True,,First purchase free.%%%%Whether you’re a schoolgirl looking for a pet or a cat looking for a playmate, a cat is always fine too! One purchase comes free as it would be a shame to go without in this world, while further purchases cost 50 CP each. In this jump they come in their chibi cat girl form as standard, and in later jumps will gain an altform of their own as an ordinary cat. Optionally, you may import a real-world cat that you own into this option!,,
Responsible Pet Owner,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free for Cat%%%%A responsible pet owner who also genuinely cares for their pets. You can decide their gender and looks freely, but one thing is immutable if you’re a cat: they think you’re an ordinary cat. Try and break the news to them gently.,,
A Good Butler,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Free if purchased with A Read Bourgeois%%%%A very good butler, willing to cook, clean, run errands, and do any sort of chore you assign them no matter how asinine, all without complaint and with a smile on their face. Nothing seems to surprise them for very long if at all, and they’re accomplished in a wide variety of purely mundane civilian skills. Again, you may choose their gender and looks.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,If you like, you can take any of the canon characters of Nyanko Days along with you. Freely choose between Yuuko, Azumi, Ran, Yuuko’s cats, or Elsa! Admittedly it’s a pretty small cast. You can even have an option to ensure that upon the moment you convince a character to go along with you on your chain, a clone pops into existence! This might cause a few shenanigans until you’re off, but it’s better than separating everyone from their loved ones, right? Clones can’t produce clones nor can they be companioned, just in case you try companioning the clone as well.,,
Entire Canon Cast,,3,,-4000,,False,,True,,But you know what? There’s really only three named human characters and four named cats in this entire series, so why not take them all so they can all stick together? Upon taking this option you can take the entire canon cast with you, all of whom will act as a singular companion for slot purposes. Again, it’s just three humans and four cats so honestly it’s not that much, but they’ll be all the happier to be together.,,
Nyan Days,,4,,00,,False,,False,,If you’re uncomfortable with the idea of cats being very tiny humans, then this drawback revokes that. Cats will just be cats, though they’ll still be oddly clever in this world.,,
Nyanko Days In Another World!,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Nyanko Days is a pretty small series, being less than a half hour long total in its anime and just nine chapters in its manga-none of which are particularly long. If you like, you can add this to another jump and treat it as a supplement to make up for the lack of defined world. Nyanko Days drawbacks will end at the end of the jump regardless.,,
Rival!,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,There’s someone out there who really doesn’t like you! They try their hardest, but you always seem to outshine them time and time again-that’s their opinion, at least. No matter what the activity, this Rival of yours will jump in to make it a competition where they’ll promptly try to outdo you. If they win they’ll be terribly smug about it and hold it over you for days. If you can settle your differences, then you can freely take them along as a companion.,,
Friendship is Hard!,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Maybe you just have trouble with crowds, or speaking in public. Maybe you’re too popular, and can’t seem to make genuine connections through all the people vying for your attention. Either way, you’re going to find it somewhat difficult to make real friends in this jump.,,
Oops.,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,When you play, you play hard. And when you walk, you walk hard. And when you live, you live hard...? Okay, so maybe something’s up here. It turns out that you’re just a naturally messy person, all too easily messing up your room or getting covered in detritus if you’re not careful. Easy enough to clean up afterwards and wash off, but it’ll be a constant problem for you. At least you’ll be good at cleaning up after yourself by the end?,,
Crybaby,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,I’m sorry, please don’t cry! - but it’s true. You’ll cry at the drop of a hat. Drop a snack, make a mistake in your notes, get confronted with something mildly challenging, and the waterworks flow. You can resist this if you really try, and it’s not like it actually stops you from doing anything, but it is fairly awkward.,,
Even Though You’re Purring That Much...?,,4,,1000,,False,,True,,You like being praised. You really like being praised. You really, really like being praised. A head pat is nirvana, and a “good job” will make the world light up for you. If you’re a cat, even the smallest pet will send you purring like an engine. You can resist this praise-addiction if you like, but it’s going to take a lot of willpower. Luckily for you, this only applies to people you know and care about-don’t worry if any old schmuck pats you on the head, because their headpats will never be as good as your loved ones!,,
Azu Azu Azu Azu Azu Azu...?,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,For reference, that’s what it sounded like when Yuuko tried to say Azumi’s first name in a conversation with said girl. And with this, that’s you too. You’re going to stutter, mess up, and mumble around others, you’re going to constantly repeat a couple of syllables while you try to muster up the courage to actually say what you mean, and you’re going to be all but mute in front of a crowd. When you’re around friends or in a comfortable environment this will fade away, it’ll come roaring back once you get embarrassed or meet someone unfamiliar.,,
Where’d You Go?,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,-You’re going to find yourself saying that fairly often if you don’t watch where you’re going while having a conversation. You’ve got a pretty horrible sense of direction, and trying to backtrack yourself is an exercise in futility as your spatial memory is like a goldfish. You can head towards landmarks and even follow directions if you really try, but other than that, you've got essentially no navigational skills.,,
I Had No Idea Walking Was So Tiring!,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It isn’t, at least for most people. But you’re not like most people, unfortunately for you. You get winded all too easily, failing to keep up with people going at more than the most casual pace and pretty physically wimpy on top of that. This doesn’t affect anything but your body, but it’s going to be pretty tough being so out of shape regardless. Maybe you should try some calisthenics?,,
Totally Average...?,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,For most, that’s not a bad thing-but in your case, it’s a bit more than that. Whatever your form is, be it cat or human, is locked for the next ten years. Further, nothing save for what you’ve bought in this jump is accessible-leaving you a fairly average human being or cat. Admittedly, it’s a peaceful world and the chances of you actually needing any other form or unique powers is pretty much null, hence it only grants 200 CP.,,
I’m On A Diet!,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You’ve found yourself obsessed with something in spite of all rationality.
