Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Caretaker,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Whether a child taking your first steps into a magical world, or an old hand, you are one of the caretakers of a magical preserve, one of the last few dozen places magical creatures of all kind can live in something like harmony, owing to a complex series of treaties and agreements. Just be careful, for even the most learned of caretakers has secrets beneath their nose, and even the safest of the sanctuaries has places no human dares tread, and nights it is not safe to go out. If you wish, you may be a caretaker at Fablehaven, Lost Mesa, or one of the other forty preserves. Or perhaps you are a fairy-trapper who brings lost magical creatures to places of safety.,,
Knight of the Dawn,,0,,00,,False,,False,,It's all well and good for caretakers to protect what they've built, but somebody has to find the Evening Star and hurt them where they live. Otherwise, we'd all sit back and watch the sanctuaries fall, one by one. You are a Knight, charged to thwart the Evening Star wherever they crawl out from underneath their rocks. Then smash the rocks for good measure.%%%%The night melts away before the rising sun, always. It is the order of things.,,
Society of the Evening Star,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Long ago, wizards bound the powerful demon lords to the prison realm of Zzyxx, and since no spell is absolute, they created ways for it to fail, keys that could be hidden and protected. A mistake. Since the demon prison will inevitably fail one day, you and your associates have realized it may as well be you who bargain the terms of the demons' release. After all, someone else might get it wrong, might be tricked by those wily demons. And if it makes you lord of the Earth, well, that's a nice side-benefit.%%%%The Evening Star heralds the coming night. It is rising.,,
Being of Magic,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Humans are so confusing with their silly struggles. You are something higher, a fairy perhaps, or a noble centaur, a mighty dragon, or something stranger.%%%%Visit the Creature section to choose your form.,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Roll 1d8 or pay 100 cp to choose.%%%%Fablehaven: site of most of the stories, a secret sanctuary where a powerful demon is bound, and a witch, and one of the five keys. Also an abandoned village and manor house, a church, a centaur commune, and an inverted tower.%%%%Lost Mesa: hidden sanctuary in Arizona, home to the Painted Mesa and Museum of Unnatural History.%%%%Wyrmroost: One of the three forbidden dragon sanctuaries, home to the sky-giant Thronis, and the dragon king Celebrant, each ruling one of the highest mountains in North America. Suicidally dangerous for any humans, even the caretaker, the wizard Agad, must step with great caution.%%%%The Obsidian Wastes: Australian preserve, home to thylacines and jackalopes, and the massive Dreamstone monolith which causes hallucinations in all who approach.%%%%Rio Branco: A preserve hidden deep in the Brazilian rain forest, little is known of the place.%%%%Living Mirage: Last of the hidden preserves, controlled for centuries by the Society and their leader, this preserve in Eastern Turkey is dominated by three stepped pyramids and extensive dungeon facilities, home to a Roc and many harpies, and an orchard of impossibly tempting fruit that all cause random horrific deaths.%%%%Shoreless Isle: How did you get here, unfortunate soul? Ah well, this island in the center of the Bermuda Triangle is hidden and unapproachable save by the Lady Luck, so you’ll have to make your own way off. It’s only features are an impenetrable stone door holding the gates to Zzzyxx, the pocket dimension most demons were long ago imprisoned in, and a shrine to the Fairy Queen, and most people who approach those don’t get a happy ending.%%%%Free choice, even somewhere in the mundane world.,,
Courtesy,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It pays to be polite, especially when dealing with creatures who would cheerfully eat you for any unintentional slight. From now on, you will always know the socially acceptable way to behave in any setting, whether dealing with unknown cultures or eldritch beings or just greedy trolls. Never again will you give accidental insult, and those insults you choose will sting ever so slightly the sharper for your knowledge of what will truly offend.,,
Caretaker - Eyes of Wonder,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The world is full of astonishing beauty, often just out of sight. A caretaker must have the patience of a careful gardener, the wondering gaze of a small child, and a head for riddles and puzzles. Luckily, you have all three in abundance. Puzzle locks and hidden messages come easily to you, and you can cheerfully spend an evening watching a sunset, or fairies fluttering around your porch.,,
Caretaker - Festival Night Veteran,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Little is more frightening in the preserves than the celebrations of each solstice and equinox, when all bindings are loosened and all but a few creatures can roam at will. To even look outside is to court disaster, as the thousand horrors outside will attempt to terrify, provoke, or tempt one into opening up their sanctuary. You, however, have done this multiple times. It is very nearly pointless to try and provoke or frighten you into action, as you emotions never overwhelm your logic in a crisis, even if you saw an infant about to die you would understand it was far more likely a trick.,,
Caretaker - Dragon Brother,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Generally, dragons regard humans as something much like mice, something to be killed just to keep the area tidy. A human brave enough to speak in a dragon's presence may be considered a talking mouse, a curiosity worth preserving as long as it's not too much trouble. You are something else, a creature at least one dragon considers an equal, and marked as such.%%%%You can speak the language of dragons, and related creatures such as hydras or serpents. Such creatures regard you as friendly as a default, though hostile actions not go unanswered. Try to be cute, little mouse. If you are killed, dragons will avenge your death as they would upon any dragonslayer.,,
Caretaker - Fairykind,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Cannot be taken with Shadow Charmer%%%%You are a human, but by the grace of the Fairy Queen also a fairy, and a special one at that. You can speak the fairy language and all it's derivatives such as Elvish.%%%%Your mind is impervious to the illusions and distractions normally used as defense against big people.%%%%You can see quite easily in the dark and will never need magic milk to see the Fair Folk.%%%%Speaking of, fairies trust and defer to you quite naturally, though there are limits to your ability to demand favors.%%%%Finally, your touch can repair and recharge all kinds of magical items, even on a moment-by-moment basis. Never will a wand run out of charges, or an ancient relic fail in your hands.,,
Caretaker - Shadow Charmer,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Cannot be taken with Fairykind%%%%You are an ally of night, consoler of phantoms, comrade of trolls, councilor of demons and as steeped in magical darkness as a human being can be.%%%%This offers several benefits, foremost being the ability to speak the languages of goblins, trolls, giants, and demons and hear the thoughts of phantoms and the undead, and having them treat you with respect and courtesy, and be happy to provide small favors or information.%%%%No invisibility or magical concealment can shield things from your eyes, though a distractor spell will still work fine.%%%%Your emotions cannot be influenced and moving slowly in shade you become effectively invisible, even to methods normally effective at finding invisible people.%%%%With time and training, you can to learn generate your own fear aura, snuff even very large fires, create magical darkness and open any lock instantly.%%%%Remember always the necromancer's rules of dealing with the undead: trust not any zombie or shade that has not sworn allegiance to you, be precise in giving orders, set clear boundaries, and apportion rewards. For instance, to set a sentry you must be clear on the area to be protected, and promise your minion the lives of any intruders.,,
Knight - The Name of That Order...,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Knights of the Dawn have technically existed since before human civilization, and always fought against demons and monsters and darkness. You carry with you the pride of being part of something so much greater than yourself, and the certainty that whatever difficulties you face today are merely the latest in a long line of problems the Knights have and will overcome.%%%%As such, despair and manipulation struggle to gain a hold in your mind, and you have a basic knowledge of the dangerous creatures of this world.,,
Knight - Potions Master,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You know how to brew the many potions of Fablehaven. You can render pure emotions into a solution, like bottled courage, make potions that cause people to shrink down to the size of an ant, or grow to thrice their height. Another potion turns people into a gas, allowing them to escape most danger. Another can cause immense pain, but only to a possessing or controlling entity, sparing the victim.,,
Knight - Eternal,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Not only must five keys be gathered to open the demon prison, five immortals who sealed Zzyxx must be slain, for their lives form an additional barrier. You are one such Eternal.%%%%Your link to the prison, and the Font of Immortality and Sands of Sanctity, mean you do not age and any wound heals near-instantly. If you were impaled through the head it may disable you, but the moment you were free it would be as if it had never happened.%%%%The only things that can bypass this effect to kill you are the magics of the unicorn, phoenix and dragon. So try not to get gored by a unicorn, annoy a dragon, or be struck by a weapon fashioned from the bodies of any of the above.%%%%In future Jumps, you may choose any one mystic prison or binding and render it inescapable while you draw breath... unless you choose to permit access.,,
Evening Star - Building Trust,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Evening Star 101, how do you get yourself embraced by a suspicious group? Make yourself a hero by saving people from a crisis you create and control, pass over many opportunities for lesser betrayal while you wait for the opportunity that matters, perhaps kill someone and represent yourself as their child to borrow the trust they had. Bonus points if you keep stressing to trust no one while consistently being the least suspicious person in the room. It's so easy, it even works on people you've explained the whole process to.%%%%You make friends easily and get people to trust you.%%%%You are also fairly skilled in recognizing the manipulations of similarly underhanded people.,,
Evening Star - Observant,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Many in the Society go masked when meeting each other, but a build, a voice, by these signs you will know someone.%%%%You are very skilled at noticing subtle giveaways and important clues, and in building the connections that will serve you well no matter what task you turn your hand to.,,
Evening Star - Blix,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are a blix, one of a family of rare magical creatures that look just like humans, but whose bite can carry a variety of effects. Perhaps you are a lectoblix, able to drain youth from your victims. Or a narcoblix, who can enter a meditative trance and puppet the bodies of whoever you bit as long as they are asleep or otherwise unconscious. Or even a viviblix, able to bite corpses and raise them as loyal zombies.%%%%This can be taken multiple times.,,
Evening Star - Were,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You have been cursed or blessed with Lycanthropy, able to turn into a powerful magically enhanced beast. Werewolves turn on the full moon, as well as the solstices and equinoxes, while Werebears, boars and lynxes can transform at will.%%%%You choose which you become. Can be taken multiple times.,,
Dragonsbane,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A deadly poison to dragons, and related creatures like hydras and sea serpents. You receive three doses and a recipe for making more. It can be diluted and mixed with other potions and drugs to make them effective on dragonkind as well.,,
Cocoon,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A little cocoon, which, if you bite down firmly, will envelop your body. The outer shell is entirely indestructible unless ripped open from within, something easily done in a minute or less, and is also watertight but provides abundant air. You can eat the inner fibers and suck on the fluids for enough food and water to stay within for several days, though it's hardly comfortable.,,
Coins,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Thirty silver coins, about the size of a US half-dollar, with a griffin on one face and mysterious sigils on the other. Running a finger clockwise around the rim will cause the coin to light up, counter to darken it. More importantly, anyone holding one coin can communicate telepathically with any other coinholder.,,
Bag of Holding,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Not an infinite storage space, but a store-room large enough to carry supplies for eight people, and eight people, easily enough. A ladder inside the bag's mouth allows entry, and the space is magically ventilated.,,
Anti-Eavesdropping Candles,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A supply of six candles with more each month. While a candle is lit, it is impossible to hear what anyone around the candle is saying without venturing within a few feet yourself, or using sufficiently powerful scrying magic like a White Orb or the Occulus.,,
Rain Stick,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A large hollow stick filled with seeds. Turned over, the falling seeds make the sound of rain. Shaken, the stick actually brings the rain, harder the more violently the stick is shaken, longer and for a wider area the longer the stick is shaken.%%%%Please use responsibly, you’d likely hate to be the cause of a flash flood.,,
Dullion,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A simple golem made out of straw. It's neither tough, nor all that strong nor clever, but can flip over a car and follow simple instructions with a minimum of supervision.,,
Limberjack,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A wooden puppet, much like the small dolls painters use to learn human poses, but man-sized. Intelligent as a person and quite loyal.,,
Golem,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,A proper golem made of earth and stone, tireless in it's labors or in combat, You may choose if it is intelligent or not.,,
Unicorn Horn,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The first horn of a unicorn is a powerful talisman against all forms of disease, poison and corruption. Though it's power can eventually be run down (until the next jump) if made to clean a vast area, it can do so. Creatures made of or heavily tied to corruption, poison, pollution or disease will be destroyed by it's touch.,,
Dragonfire Sword,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A sword with a dragon fang in the handle. When swung, the edge of the sword will heat with dragon’s fire at the moment of impact, allowing the blade to cut/burn through most solid materials with ease. You may choose to apply this effect to any blade in your possession instead of adding a new sword.,,
Black and White Orbs,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,For those with a desire to rule, the white orb allows one to scry any part of their domain, or any property they own, and for some miles around. The black orb allows one to influence the weather over their holdings to an extent, at minimum to halve or double the winds and the rain. Someone with a great affinity for magic, or for the air might be able to conjure mighty storms from nothing or deal precise lightning strikes.,,
Precious Figurines,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A set of five figurines carved from precious stone. The ruby dragon and jade chimera expand to life-size, animate and obedient to whoever activates them by reading the magic word on the base. The agate leviathan and marble snow giant do the same on being placed in water/snow respectively. The onyx tower also expands to a full size, but does not come to life, when placed on the ground.,,
Banishment Rod,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A short, coppery rod. Point it at someone or something and yell the activation word “Begone!” and they shall fly far, far away.,,
Milch Milk or Walrus Butter,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free Caretaker%%%%A steady supply of magic milk or butter from one of the magic cows or walruses kept by nearly all sanctuaries. Besides being beloved by fairies and good for offerings, it is necessary to taste some each day if you wish to see the magical and extraordinary and not just dragonflies or mounds that move when you aren't looking. In future jumps, this will allow ordinary people to see through Mist or muggle-repelling charms or whatever else keeps people from noticing the supernatural in front of their faces.,,
Magic Salt and Flash Powder,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Free Caretaker%%%%Magic salt can be used to form lines or circles on the ground which many magical creatures like common fairies, goblins and kobolds cannot cross, or tossed in the air to form a temporary cloud as shield. Flash powder is a lot more powerful, but also volatile and can burn the user, and cannot lay static defenses. The most powerful entities, like unicorns, dragons and demons will not be much bothered even by Flash Powder, but it’s a handy weapon of last resort for a Caretaker.,,
Adamant Breastplate and Shield,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free Knight%%%%Armor for your torso, perfectly fitted and near-unbreakable, while being light enough to be scant inconvenience. Comes with a shield of the same material. Can be taken in the form of chainmail if you prefer.,,
Invisibility Glove,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Discount Knight%%%%A magic glove that make you nearly impossible to see, as long as you hold relatively still or move only very slowly.,,
Umite Wax,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Free Evening Star%%%%Five pounds of pixie-made wax, refilling weekly. When something is written or drawn with an umite crayon, it can only be detected by the light of a candle of the same wax. A convenient way of sharing secret messages, and a common enough security precaution to be worth having a counter for. After this jump, umite candles will reveal all hidden marks and writing, though they may not help you decipher them.,,
Stingbulb,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Discount Evening Star%%%%A box of three stingbulbs, renewing weekly. When a stingbulb pricks a person's flesh, it turns into a flawless duplicate of that person in ninety minutes. The stingbulb imprints on the first person they see and will loyally follow their commands, desiring only what they are told to. They have all the original's memories up to the point they were stung, but will not duplicate powers. Stingbulbs die after two or three days, of seemingly natural causes. An excellent way to fake a death, or provide a decoy, or even interrogation.,,
Quiet Box,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,Sometimes, despite your best efforts, evil can only be locked away. The Quiet Box is a rarity in a world where all magic needs some escape clause, an entirely inescapable prison. Built in the form of a large elaborate wardrobe, itself very nearly impervious to harm, if a person or entity is shut inside they vanish from the world, opening the Box would only find it empty.%%%%Prisoners are preserved in stasis, dimly aware of the passage of time, with dreamlike awareness of events outside, they can persist for thousands of years.%%%%Of course, since there must always be an escape clause, the way to get someone out of a Quiet Box is miraculously simple, it has an occupancy of one. Simply shut a new prisoner in the box and the door will spring open to reveal the previous occupant.,,
Wizenstone,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,An ordinary stone in appearance, this rock has the power, by touch, to break all forms of enchantment or curse, undo any spell or binding. It can even unmake the defenses and foundational treaty of a preserve. Extremely powerful, particularly in the wrong hands.,,
Vasilis, Sword of Light and Darkness,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,The sword of the great wizard Morisant, last and greatest of the six blades of legend. In appearance, a sword of black material that nevertheless is surrounded by a corona of shining white light, in the hands of an individual it takes on an appearance particular to them, often burning.%%%%The sword is a magical mirror which reflects the virtues of its wielder, and so doubles them while minimizing flaws, and likewise it will double the supernatural powers of the wielder while halving their weaknesses. The sword removes doubt and fear, and guides the hand that wields it, depending on the strength of its wielder, it can pierce armor and part the mightiest flesh.%%%%In the hands of the wicked or corrupt, it loses much of its power.%%%%Vasilis cannot be taken away, nor can the wielder be disarmed. Even if they die, the blade can be taken up only by a true friend of theirs. You may apply these effects to a sword or other weapon in your possession.,,
Keys to the Demon Prison,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,There are five extremely powerful artifacts which must be gathered to open the gateway to Zzyxx, each quite useful enough to tempt even someone who should know better. These are scattered in secure dungeon crawls in five hidden preserves, but if you want to cut in line and receive the normal benefits of cp-backing, go right ahead. Each purchase grants one item, a duplicate of the existing key and still quite capable of cracking Zzyxx.%%%%The Sands of Sanctity are held in a kitten-shaped teapot. Poured out, even a pinch will heal any wound or disease short of death. Normally, when they're gone, they're gone, but yours refills monthly.%%%%The Chronometer is a foot-long orb covered in complex dials. It is a time-machine, though one fiendishly complex to operate. It cannot take people to a point before the birth of the operator, or oldest member of the group, and it's only transit to the future is to the next time someone pushes the button on top. The Chronometer itself does not travel, normally you would have to be standing within a few meters of your transit site exactly thirty minutes into your visit or be trapped in the other time-period, but for the CP you spend here, you will automatically transport to the moment you left upon returning to the site, no matter how much time has passed.%%%%The Occulus is a small crystal orb that can scry absolutely everywhere and pierce any concealment. Information overload is a serious risk, however, and few can use it without being reduced to a coma. Yours greatly lessens this risk by waking the operator after an hour.%%%%The Translocator is a teleporter, a silver cylinder about two feet tall with handles on the sides for passengers. It goes where the person holding the end imagines, but can only take you somewhere the operator has been before.%%%%The Font of Immortality is a drinking horn filled with water that refills within moments of being emptied. Who drinks of its waters will be safeguarded against disease and not age... for a period of one week. Unlike the canon one, people using this will not turn to dust after a week without, they will simply resume aging normally.,,
Companion Import,,3,,00,,False,,False,,You may import any number of companions for free with 400 cp to spend, and no ability to take drawbacks. For 200 cp, you import companions with 800 cp to spend, but still no drawbacks.,,
Creatures,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This section only for those who took the Being of Magic origin. No discounts.,,
Fairy,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,Small, flighty and incredibly vain, your new form is breathtakingly beautiful, can fly and create various small illusions and transformations.,,
Fairy - Imp,,0,,1000,,False,,True,,What happens when a fairy is trapped indoors overnight, their beauty turns into ugliness, and their inherent good becomes wickedness. The powers are pretty much the same though, minus flight.,,
Fairy - Jinn Harp,,0,,-1000,,False,,True,,An incredibly beautiful fairy with siren-like abilities to calm animals and entrance or lure humans with song.,,
Fairy - Naiad,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,A spirit of the water, made of water and with some small influence over the bodies of water you inhabit. Naiads live to lure mortals to a watery grave, finding drowning them the funniest thing.,,
Fairy - Astrid,,0,,-3000,,False,,True,,An elite warrior of the Fairy court, at the moment, somewhat inconveniently banished and turned to owls with human faces for failing to protect the Fairy King, your true form is that of a human-sized person of breathtaking beauty, superhuman strength, and blinding speed, armed and armored in magic items and skilled beyond mortal warriors, and moderate telepaths besides, and it may yet be restored to you, after which your owl form will be available as well.,,
Satyr,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,Fast running, clever goat-men, but also lazy and cowardly.,,
Dreadwolf,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,A wolf with two heads and unnaturally keen senses. Hard to sneak up on.,,
Octobear,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,A bear with eight long tentacles for bringing enemies in reach of it’s claws and maw.,,
Goblin,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,Mischievous shapeshifters, not all that bright and quite ugly in their true forms.,,
Centaur,,0,,-3000,,False,,True,,Centaurs are some of the fleetest, strongest, most physically capable beings around, and dab hands at math and philosophy, and they never let anyone forget it. Fantastic archers, they can command a lot of ground, but are prickly and sensitive in their pride, rejecting even the admiration of their lessers.,,
Lich,,0,,-3000,,False,,True,,A skeletal undead that retains its intellect. A lich’s touch leaves bruises on the living, able to command lesser undead like zombies, skeletons and wights.,,
Giant,,0,,-3000,,False,,True,,In many ways, humanity writ large. Giants are bigger, tougher and far stronger than humans, and also hungrier and prone to violence. Many giants go berserk at the scent of blood, which they can detect kilometers away, though you can exercise more control.,,
Giant - Fog Giant,,0,,-1000,,False,,True,,Slightly bigger than average, Fog Giants have bluish-grey skin and a far more formidable sense of smell than their brethren.,,
Giant - Hill Giant,,0,,-1000,,False,,True,,Small for a giant, only half the height of a tall tree, Hill Giants are far more bellicose, and heavily armored.,,
Giant - Snow Giant,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,Physically made of ice and snow, with the power to cast cold winds and freeze people or objects with their breath.,,
Giant - Sky Giant,,0,,-3000,,False,,True,,The largest, strongest and toughest of giants, widely believed to be extinct. Their strength is even greater than their large frames suggest, their skill at arms, considerable and their magic mighty as well, in particular any magic or power altering the weather is far stronger when cast by them. Comes with free Black and White Orbs.,,
Changeling,,0,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are an animal, specifically, all of them. You can assume the form and abilities of any form of animal life save human (until after this Jump) or supernatural creatures. You always retain the power of speech and your own mind.,,
Unicorn,,0,,-6000,,False,,True,,About what you expect, a white horse with a horn. Well, unicorns grow three in their lives, each several times more powerful than the last, shedding the first two as they grow.%%%%Unicorns can assume a (idealized) human form by detaching their horn at any time. A unicorn can read minds and determine character at a glance, and has immense powers revolving around healing, purification and light. Even in human form, a unicorn can read minds via touch, and generate small amounts of light.%%%%A horn can also channel magic, greatly amplifying a unicorn’s spells, and turn into a magic sword. Horns can be summoned, if the unicorn is nearby.%%%%Finally, unicorns are the rockstars of the fairy world, even more so than Fairykind, as the Fairy Queen herself is a unicorn. Even in other worlds, minor fairies will fall over themselves to assist in your merest whims, and even fey royalty tend to be very impressed with you.,,
Dragon,,0,,-6000,,False,,True,,What you all came for. Large, powerful, majestic. Dragons have powerful magic, an aura of terror that paralyzes most humans, and the ability to charm their prey via eye contact and assume temporary human forms. In addition to the standard flight and fire-breath, which they can in some cases gain variants of, like lightning, acid sleep-inducing gas, blasts of light, molten gold, truth gas and the seething night, the one corrosive powerful enough to harm a dragon. All these you may learn in time.,,
Dragon - Fairy Dragon,,0,,00,,False,,True,,Requires Fairykind%%%%Or perhaps you're not so rough and mean, if your egg was infused with fairy magics, you could be a fairy dragon. Where other dragons are several times the size of elephants, your draconic form is smaller, hardly able to gobble down a human in one bite. Your colors are brighter, your sharp spines rounded off.%%%%Instead of fire or any other option, your breath weapon encourages rapid growth and healing.%%%%You can also turn invisible and travel in moments to fairy shrines, fairy circles and other places of import to the Fae or steeped in nature-related magic. While your physical resilience is a match for the greatest of dragons, you’ll largely be considered something of an embarrassment, an undersized sparkly sissy.,,
Dragon - Poison Dragon,,0,,00,,False,,True,,Requires Dragonsbane%%%%Like the famed dragon Siletta, you have taken poison into yourself until your whole being was synonymous with it. Every piece of you is deadly poison in thirty or more varieties, and wherever you tread you are preceded by a miasma of deadly fumes that can kill even the most resilient of humans in moments.%%%%Your breath weapon is a toxic purple sludge that can dissolve all organic matter in moments, and itself emits poison gas.,,
Dragon - Wizard,,0,,00,,False,,True,,A dragon is among the most powerful magical beings there is, but a dragon who gives up their draconic form for magic is stronger still, and can still live for millennia.%%%%Your skill and ease with magic is ridiculous, your spells more potent than your peers and you can easily learn any magic you can perform in days where others might take years, and modify what spells you know on the fly. Your mana or whatever equivalent reserves are nearly inexhaustible, and regenerate fully in moments anyways.%%%%\You will, however, earn the undying contempt and enmity of this world's dragons, who regard you as a turncoat.,,
Dragon - Hydra,,0,,00,,False,,True,,A serpent of a different kind, no wings, no breath weapon, no assuming the weak form of a human, only the aura of awe and terror, dragoncharming, and an ability to survive and regenerate from anything, save the death of the one head that governs the others.,,
What Kind of a Story?,,4,,00,,False,,False,,The world of Fablehaven is much like ours, and takes place in a sort of timeless state that could be virtually anytime after the 1950s or so, and of course there were important events long before that. And so this Jump may act as a supplement to any Jump taking place on Earth, adding the preserves, characters and situations of the series there.,,
Growing Boy,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,It seems you are constantly hungry, ever feeling the urge for a snack. Maybe some chocolate, or hot, greasy fast food. If you go more than an hour or two without some form of sustenance, your stomach will actually pain you.,,
A Promise is a Promise,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You owe Doren and Newel of Fablehaven a hundred batteries for their portable TV, or an alternative power source, and they will have what they are due. They’re not very threatening, but as Fablehaven’s foremost pranksters, they are cunning, persistent and when they want to be, extremely annoying.,,
Barrow Trolls,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,A Barrow Troll has moved into your Warehouse. They’re solitary and skittish creatures as a rule, but they’ll also eat just about anything, rearrange your things, and don’t really clean up after themselves. Have fun.,,
Innocence is No Longer a Shield,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Normally the treaties governing the preserves protect anyone from harm unless they first break the peace, offer truly egregious insult, or trespass in certain areas outlined in the foundational treaty. By taking this drawback, the treaties no longer treat you as an innocent and you can be attacked by any being with the inclination.,,
A Summer You’ll Never Forget,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The story of how Kendra and Seth Sorenson save the world is now missing a key element- the children in question. Now you wake on insertion in the backseat of a car, as a twelve-year-old, as your parents drop you off with your weird grandparents who live in the woods as they leave on a three-week cruise. Let’s hope you’re sharp enough not to end the world, eh?,,
Blinded By The Light,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Exactly what it says, you cannot see. Hopefully you have other senses to replace your vision, or weren’t planning on doing any fighting. Also, the list of books available in braille is shockingly sparse.,,
Spreading Shadows,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Somehow, you’ve contracted the shadow plague, and are being slowly overwhelmed by darkness. As a human, this means you’ll fade away into a powerless ghost, only able to be seen and heard by a shadow charmer. As a magical creature, you shall become increasingly powerful and aggressive until you become an evil darkened version of yourself.%%%%The plague can be cured only by finding and destroying the source. You have a few days before you are powerless or unwilling to do so. Good luck.,,
