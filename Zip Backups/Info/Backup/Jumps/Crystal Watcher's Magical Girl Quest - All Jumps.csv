Name,,Type,,CP Change,,Active,,Chained,,Description,,Notes
Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Independent,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are not aligned with any faction, be it the UL or the UD. This gives you more freedom than most others enjoy, but you will find that having dependable companions is just as good as raw power sometimes. (You can either start unaligned or aligned with one of the minor factions. Think Gaias WEAPONS or serving under Shiva.%%%%This can also be used as Drop-in Origin.%%%%Note that nothing is stopping you from joining either the UL or UD, you will just have to work your way up and gain trust.),,
United Light,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are aligned with the UL, making you probably part of the Counter force, though that is not required. You fight for goodness and justice, side by side with Angels and other such beings, driving back the Darkness while protecting the innocent! At least that is what you probably want, but the endless Demonic Hordes don't make it easy and since the fall of Hope the war has come to a stalemate, maybe you will be the one to change that?,,
United Darkness,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Well....didn't expect that, but who am I to judge you? You are part of the UD, composed of Demons, Nightmares and other such horrors, you work to subjugate the entire Multiverse. Now don't get the wrong idea, not everyone in the UD is evil, there are actually some nice people here. Its just that nice, doesn't mean good. You could befriend the nice Succubus nurse that heals you and your friends, but be aware that she probably also rapes the captives and sees nothing wrong with that.%%%%Who knows, maybe you will change the UD for the better.,,
Affinities,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Every Magical Girl possesses three Affinities. A Foundation, one that specifies how their Magic manifests itself and one Growth Affinity that specifies how fast a Magical Girl will grow in Power. You can choose the first two now, they can be anything, going from things like Fire and Light, to stranger things like Dreams or Dancing.,,
Growth Affinity,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Now that you have your foundational and executing affinity it's time to get your Growth Affinity.%%%%Growth affinities are a bit different then the other affinities, as they actually represent the Metaphysical “Weight” of your soul. There are five main types of Growth affinities, going from weakest to strongest: Story, Myth, Legend, Epic, Divinity.%%%%%%Then there are also Maker affinities. Those only go up to Legend rank and basically only represent your growth, without putting any “Weight” behind your soul. Maker ranks are: Story Maker, Myth Maker and Legend Maker.%%%%Prices are as followed: Story(Free), Myth(-100CP), Legend(-200CP), Epic(-400CP), Divinity(-800CP). Taking the Maker version of an Affinity halves the price of the affinity.%%%%%%Note:%%Divinity serves as Capstone booster for other Perks in this Jump, Also for more info on the “Weight” of a Soul look in the notes at the end of the Jump%%%%Divinity is Discounted as long as you have the Drawback: Nepgear is You.,,
Basic Statistics,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Health, Base Damage, Base Resilience and Magic Modifier. That are the base statistics every Magical Girl possesses. Depending on your Growth affinity the amount you start with varies but the basic version is free for all Magical Girls. You aren't a normal Magical Girl though.%%%%For 100CP per purchase you can boost your starting stats by 100. There is no limit on how many times you can purchase this perk.,,
Transformation Time,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Each Magical Girl has a different amount of time they can stay transformed, some can stay transformed for days on end, while some poor girls only get one minute.%%%%Time: Under 30 minutes +100CP, an hour (Free), a Week -100CP, No Limit -200CP,,
Transformation Type,,1,,00,,False,,True,,There are currently three different known types of transformation.%%%%The first one reinforces the Body with Magic, making it more durable and making that your Magical Girl form.%%%%The second creates a new body out of Magic, which you use while transformed, storing your real body in an unknown, though protected(by Jump fiat) place.%%%%The Third will only become known once Nepgear gets hurt pretty badly and it comes out that she has both types. In a manner that is. She has no human body anymore, both her normal body and Magical Girl form being basically Magic constructs created from her magic. She can still be hurt, but it is much harder, represented in quest by the ability *No Longer Human* which halves all damage taken. while also making body injuries a non issue. Note that that doesn't mean she can't get hurt.%%%%%%Type: 1 and 2 are free should you wish to have the 3rd type however you will have to pay 300CP, you will gain the same boons Nepgear will gain from it.,,
Outfit,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Design your Magical Girl outfit. It can look however you like and even if it's a skimpy bikini it will still protect your entire body. How? Magic, I don't have to explain shit.%%%%Your outfits durability scales with your Base Resilience, meaning that even when you are a cosmic horror it will still protect you. Though note that it is by no means a perfect defense.,,
Weapon,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Like all Magical Girls you possess a Weapon unique to you. This can be anything, from a sword to a giant chainsaw, or even just a floating ball of light. Like your outfit, this weapon grows with you, being basically an extension of yourself.,,
Shop,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Unlike most other Magical Girls who create Spells, gain strength or upgrade their weapons by spending their EXP subconsciously you get a Shop interface, where you can see every possible Upgrade you can buy with your EXP. This lets you plan your growth far more precisely then you would be able to normally.,,
Independent - Sorry, I'm Lost,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Don ?t you hate it when you take the wrong turn and are suddenly in a high security area? Yeah, I know the feeling. Well worry not!%%%%With this perk people will be more ready to believe you when you claim to be simply lost. Note that this by no means is absolute and if you sneak into a hidden super base expect to be contained. If it's just a high security area in an otherwise open building? Well then mistakes happen, just don ?t do it again.,,
Independent - Mercenary,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You will always find work, even if you don't belong to a faction they will have at least some small jobs for you and if you do these jobs well enough you will get better and better ones. All the while they will not push you to join, though expect them to at least ask you to on a semi regular basis.,,
Independent - Neutral Entity,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You can work for two sides in a war and as long as you don't betray the secrets of one of them to the other, can expect them to be okay with that situation. Though killing the friend of one of your coworkers will still piss them off, it just won't impact their work relationship with you as much as it should.%%%%This can also be used to make people leave you alone, as long as you don't interfere in whatever conflict it is. Want to spend your entire ten years here just watching the sparks fly, without any danger to you and your friends? This is the Perk for you.,,
Independent - Conceptual Being,,1,,-12000,,False,,True,,This Multiverse is filled with more than just frilly dresses and genocidal wars. No, in the corners of the Multiverse lurk Cosmic horrors and Divine Entities alike and some of them embody a Concept. You are now one of them.%%%%Choose one of your first two Affinities, you are now the conceptual embodiment of that concept.%%%%This gives you absolute control over that concept and you will be aware of nearly everything that is connected to your concept on a Multiversal scale.%%%%%%Example:%%Being the concept of Hunt would mean you are aware of anything that could be called a hunt in the Multiverse you are currently in and embody also all the traits needed to Hunt on a Cosmic scale.%%%%%%You start out as an infant conceptual being, still incredibly OP by mortal standards, but I wouldn't challenge any Gods, other conceptual Beings or strong Magical Girls for a while.%%%%The concepts you choose are treated like they are also your Magical Girl Concepts, giving your magic even more ways to express itself.,,
Conceptual Being + Divinity - Conceptual Entity,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You are an infant Multiverse, a being similar to Cosmos and Void, while still far, far weaker right now at some point you will house innumerable Universes.%%%%This is also shown by your power, as you are able to punch on a Multiversal power level and that isn't even getting into the hax abilities you can pull.%%%%You may also pick two other concepts and add them to your portfolio, giving you the same abilities with them as with the first concept you picked with this Perk.,,
United Light - Smile!,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,As much as you might want it, this World is filled with its fair share of tragedy. But that doesn ?t matter! You can make others feel better, with just a little kindness.%%%%People will feel better in your presence, even war hardened veterans being able to just relax in your presence.%%%%This won't heal extensive mental scars on its own, but it will offer the perfect opportunity for you to do more, should you have the capabilities to be a Therapist that is, otherwise you will simply be the place of rest most of your friends look forward to come back to.,,
United Light - Little Girls, Big Guns,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,People will take you seriously. You might look like a little twelve year old, but should you have the experience people will treat you accordingly.%%%%Though they might ask for proof before they take you seriously.,,
United Light - Team JUMP,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Isn't it just sad how you have to leave people behind simply because you grow stronger much faster then they will ever be able to?%%%%Well worry not, for with this perk all your friends will gain a Growth boost just a little bit weaker than your own.%%%%A normal soldier could go from standard human to mid tier Magical Girl power levels in maybe a week. As long as your own growth rate would permit such growth for you that is.%%%%You will also find that any growth they have will help your own growth along, if only a little.,,
United Light - Light of Hope,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Archangel Gabriel, the Four Goddesses, the Fragments of Peace and Team GEAR. All of them beings that marked, or will mark, history with their deeds. They were and are the beacons of the UL in this endless war and you are now among them. Yours is a presence that has to be felt to believe it.%%%%Your allies will draw comfort and bravery from your presence, while your enemies flee from you on sight, should they be weak enough.%%%%Your presence also impacts the combat abilities of all people you fight with and against, making allies more capable and enemies weaker.%%%%Above all that though is your ability to inspire people, you are someone that will influence generations to come and when a little girl says she wants to be a magical girl you will be one of the ones she aspires to be like.%%%%In a few hundred years your name will be spoken of in just as much, if not more, reverence than now.,,
Light of Hope + Divinity - Let there be LIGHT,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You are all that was described above and yet so much more. While before your presence was a thing to behold it has now reached the point where words can no longer describe it.%%%%Everywhere where you go and where you were at one point is bathed in the effects of your presence, boosting beings you would ally with and weakening beings you would fight even without you being there. And when you are there?%%%%Your foes burn up in your presence, scattering as ash, with only those truly far more powerful then you not dying simply by virtue of your presence.%%%%You can also add the concept of Light to your Magical girl affinities as if it was your second or first concept, this will not interfere with whatever you already have, simply adding to you.,,
United Darkness - Backstab immunity,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The UD is filled with many that seek opportunities to rise in station and many of them are willing to throw others under the bus to reach their goals, as seen with the fiancee of a certain Practitioner.%%%%You will always know when someone has ulterior motives to interact with you and will also be able to tell if those motives will be dangerous for you, or if they are simply trying to munch of your fame, or something like that.,,
United Darkness - Mama Succubus and the Nice Grunt,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Even if most of the people in the UD are monsters and assholes that do atrocities on a regular basis you will always be able to find some people that aren't complete monsters. Be it the nice Succubus nurse that loves all her children deeply and just wants to adopt you, even if most of those kids she has are born from her rapeing prisoners, or the quiet Grunt Demon that loves to discuss literature with you before he goes slaughter that little town.%%%%While you won't be able to change them entirely, your presence and company will at least make them slightly better than they already were.,,
United Darkness - Slaughter Demon,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You are a being of carnage and destruction, there is no nicer way of saying it. While on a battlefield you will grow in power the more beings you slaughter and the more the slaughter the better and stronger you and your allies become.%%%%This boost will slowly wane after a battle is finished, but you will also find that you grow much faster when you fight others.,,
United Darkness - Dark Lord,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,While not one of the true Dark Lords that lead the UD, you are definitely in their league power and presence wise.%%%%When you enter a battle field your enemies flee in terror while your allies and servants cheer in savage joy of the carnage that is to follow. More scary than that though is your ability to corrupt others to see your point of view.%%%%Be it through the use of a silver tongue during a battle with your rival, or after torturing someone for days, people are more prone to break and see your point of view. With enough time and power you could convince Nepgear that the best way to bring eternal peace is through the enslavement of all. That's how scary your ability to convince and corrupt is.,,
Dark Lord + Divinity - Drowned in DARKNESS,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You are everything described above, yet so much more...%%%%Your presence is corruption and suffering, torturing and annihilating your foes wherever you might go, simply by virtue of your existence, with only those by far your greater not being affected,%%%%The land where you let your presence out is forever tainted, blessing your allies with eldritch strength while torturing those you might see as enemies.%%%%Those you corrupt will never free themselfs, as their very souls are drowned and changed in your Darkness.%%%%You can add the concept of Darkness to your Magical Girl concepts like it was your first or second concept, this does not interfere with whatever you already have, simply adding more to what you already are.,,
Concept Speech,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Discounted if you have Conceptual Being%%%%You can communicate with the base concept of the Multiverse. Meaning that you could make your ire known by throwing the Concept of Wrath at someone.%%%%Not only is this incredibly efficient in bringing your point across, it is also very, very lethal for anything not on the level of a God. Normal people and even most Magical Girls would die from simply standing near you while you communicate like that.,,
Reflections through the Kaleidoscope,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,In your sleep you can gain insight in parallel worlds and different timelines, while what you see won't always be helpful, you will always be able to gain some experience from it. Just be aware that not everything you see will be pretty.,,
Bad End,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Once per Jump, or every ten years, when you would normally face Chain failure you will instead be transported back to the moment where your decisions got you killed. For example, say you went on a mission you had no chance of finishing and died, you would end up shortly before you accepted that mission.,,
SEXY,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You are incredibly beautiful. This is not limited to gender or preference. When looking at you everyone will have to agree that you are sexy, even if you are a guy and that other guy isn ?t gay, thats how hot you are.%%%%It's like the concept of Sexy had come down and blessed you.....wait....nah can ?t be....,,
Items,,2,,5000,,False,,False,,You get a 500CP Stipend for this section only.,,
Independent - Omni-Papers,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,These identifications will work anywhere where identifications are used. Be it on Earth or on a planet far, far away, people will see papers that seem legitimate.,,
Independent - A Home,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,It can be a bit shitty to have no place to belong. Now that's no longer the case for you.%%%%You get a large house filled with all the niceties of a high society bachelor house. Pool, giant kitchen, Spa, it is basically the perfect place to lean back and relax for a while.%%%%This house will appear in a predetermined location in the Jump and follows you through all your Jumps. You can also turn it into part of your Warehouse if you wish.,,
Independent - BEAST,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A mindless Beast that will protect all your properties with its life and will respawn after a short while if killed. Truly the best guard dog one could ask for.%%%%To put this into perspective, this thing is strong enough to destroy entire mountain ranges with one swipe and will grow stronger as you do.%%%%It can ?t leave your properties though, but is present in all properties you own, at the same time, existing as multiple instances of itself at once.,,
Independent - Planet-Chan!,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,It's a planet! Your planet to be precise. You can customize it however you want and as long as you exist it can't be destroyed. Have fun!,,
United Light - Data Mine,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You get a Data Mine that has access to every instance of the internet in the multiverse you are currently in.,,
United Light - Base of Operation,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A Military base around as large as base Ataraxia, with all the things such a base would need. Weapons, armors, hospital wing, training field, command rooms, barracks and more.%%%%The supplies will fill up at the start of each week, yes the ammunition too. Yes that means if you put ammunition made out of Mithril or something into it you will gain more at the start of next week, don't try it with unique items though, those will not be replicated.,,
United Light - Progenitor Golem,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A huge Mech like armor that you can summon at any time. It will augment all your abilities but comes with a steep stamina drain if used too long.,,
United Light - Heavenly Paradise,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The perfect vacation spot. This is a copy of this universe's Heaven, filled with friendly NPCs that guard it and work in all the facilities Heaven has. Enjoy some time at the beach, eat food that tastes like your favorite food of all time and visit the Nexus.%%%%This will attach to your Warehouse and if you want can also be used as an afterlife for any souls you collect in one way or another.,,
United Darkness - Target List,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A self updating list of your enemies, telling you their location and all abilities you already know of. Handy if you are hunting someone down.,,
United Darkness - Base of Operation,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Similar to the item with the same name in the United Light section. This Base is more medieval then modern. Think of a large castle or something like that.,,
United Darkness - Nightmare Breeding Ground,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Welp, this is scary in its own right. You get a piece of land in which a Greater Nightmare is breeding. This greater Nightmare isn't really conscious, nor are its children, being more like drones then anything like a living being.%%%%This pit will transform into a nightmare scape tailored for anyone you throw into it and should they not get out soon, they will find themselves caught and used as breeding station for even more Nightmare drones, all the while suffering in a Nightmare created just to torture them.%%%%Truly a prison of horrors.,,
United Darkness - The Hells,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A copy of this universe's Hells, coming with a loyal Demon army to call your own. Well, good conquest Jumper.,,
Old Friends,,3,,-1000,,False,,False,,The typical Import option. You can Import up to 8 companions with this, but all companions share the same 1000CP stipend, so less might be more in this case. But that is all up to you.,,
Friends we Made Along the Way,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,You can use this to take any canon character with you, as long as you can convince them to come with you. Paying the -100CP will guarantee that you meet whoever you chose in a positive situation making it easier to convince them.,,
AU Toggle,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Choose one of the many AU ?s this Universe has spawned. You will spend your time there instead of the canon universe.,,
Crossover,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Crystal Watcher at one point made a Crossover with Bleach, well now so can you.%%%%Choose another work of fiction, you will now find yourself in a crossover with that setting.%%%%How that is done I leave to you, be it fusing the two, or isekaing yourself to the other one. The sky's the limit.,,
18+ Toggle,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Well, it seems we have a pervert here. The world becomes just a little lewder, I leave the degree of how much to you, you know what you want in that regard I am sure.,,
I want to spent more time with you...,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Ten years can be so very short, especially for a Jumper with who knows how many Jumps under his belt. By taking this drawback you can add another ten years to this Jumps time. This can be chosen up to ten times.,,
That is NOT my Name!!,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You will get an annoying nickname and you will not get rid of it for the entire Jump. Even your Imported Companions will use it.,,
Fresh Meat,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Shortly after your Jump starts you will be attacked by an enemy you would not be able to kill with the abilities you bought in this Jump and for the entire fight your out of Jump powers will not work. Don ?t worry though, help is on the way, you just need to survive for the next five minutes. Man what a stressing way to start off a Jump.,,
It's not like I like you or anything!!,,4,,2000,,False,,True,,Congrats, at some point you will meet a Tsundere that will become your Rival. She will have the same Growth affinity as you and will not stop challenging you until you dominate her so hard that there is no other way to see it then your absolute victory. At that point you can even ask her to become your companion, if Tsunderes are your thing that is.%%%%Note that you can't use out of Jump powers to win against her, it has to be with your abilities from this Jump or she will call you a wimpy cheater that can't win without cheating.,,
Not a Magical Girl at all.,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Well, it seems there was a little mix up when you were brought into the world. See all those nice magical abilities and extra affinities you chose? You wont get them until after this Jump.%%%%Because you weren't inserted into a Human Girl, maybe not even into a Human. I am sorry for the mix up.,,
Trauma, everyone gets some.,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Well looks like you will have a really shitty background story. Maybe your parents abused you, maybe your family died a horrible death. Fact is you will carry that Trauma with you and while nothing stops you from getting over it you will need to do that the organic way, as all perks that instantly cure it wont work in that regard. Perks that just augment the speed at which you get over Trauma are still fair game though.,,
Nepgear is you.,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,You take the place of the original quests MC Anastasia Boeheart, better known as Nepgear.%%%%This locks your first two affinities into Purity and Faith and gives you a discount on the Divinity Growth Affinity.%%%%In exchange you get a boatload of trauma, that doesn't get affected by any mental perks, you will have to work through it the normal way.%%%%You will definitely get pulled into the conflict of UL and UD.%%%%You are the MC now and the Universe knows it, there is no escaping the Plot and that means you will be pulled into fight after fight with even your down time being filled by personal drama for you and others.,,
Mahou, Mahou never changes...,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,You will not find lasting peace in this Jump. Whenever you manage to end conflict in some way you will get maybe a few months of peace, but then a new enemy will appear, greater and more terrible than the one before. You can also not escape this, as those enemies, seemingly by random chance will always find you, even if you aren ?t the one they seek.,,
...But it was too late...,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Well, whatever version of this world you picked, your enemy has won in this version. If you are aligned with the UL the UD has shattered the last of the UL and has now taken control of the Universe, rebels still exist, but they are by far to weak right now to do anything against their new Overlords. If you are part of the UD the UL has somehow permanently destroyed the Dark Lords and has killed most Demons and Nightmares, as well as any Magical Girls aligned with the UD.%%%%Should you be independent, well both sides have decided that having you unaligned is no longer an option and will soon come with an offer you should not refuse. Should you refuse the offer they will do their best to kill you, sending entire kill squads after you. Should you refuse both the UL ?s and the UD ?s offer you get double the CP, cause damn are you fucked otherwise.,,
Void would like to have a Word with you...,,4,,10000,,False,,True,,Well there you have it, before the end of this Jump you will have to Duel Void, an Multiverse level Entity and should you lose your Chain will end here. What Void did not tell you was that should you win, you get to take an avatar of Cosmos and her with you as companions and Cosmos has even agreed to make you part of their relationship. Also don ?t get fooled by Void's behavior, she is actually a bit of a Tsundere, though that's mostly for Cosmos only.,,
The Perfect Cake,,5,,00,,False,,True,,You can choose to do this Scenario at any point in your Jump. At some point, for the Birthday of one of your companions, new or old it doesn't matter, you will try to make the Perfect Cake. It is going to be perfect and when your friend eats it they will be moved to tears and it's gonna be the best birthday ever!%%%%%%You have to create a Cake that will move whoever it's made for to tears from how good it is, if you manage that you not only gain the satisfaction of making a friend's Birthday unforgettable, but you also gain the ability to make any food you make better.%%%%This is a quality change on a conceptual level, meaning that your Cake is just more cakey than cakes made by others, which makes it better.%%%%It also improves any boosts your food might be able to convey, meaning that if you have supernatural cooking that heals others, that effect will be boosted to even greater heights. Regenerating an allies limbs was never easier, or more delicious.,,
Hope,,5,,00,,False,,True,,Humanity's first settlement outside of Earth, which fell in the event known as the Fall of Hope. It is also the place where the former icon of the UL, Archangel Gabriel lost her life, or so it seems. Should you choose this scenario you will start in Hope, one day before its invasion by the UD.%%%%To complete the scenario you need to survive the fall, as well as save Gabriel, no easy feat. Should you manage that you will be celebrated as a Hero by the UL and Gabriel will be happy to follow you on your journey as a companion, as long as she can return after your chain is done to look after her home.%%%%%%Should you be part of the UD however....%%You will need to kill or capture all Magical Girls as well as other powerful UL aligned beings in Hope to finish this scenario. This will not be easy, considering that all of the Goddesses Four are here and of course Gabriel.%%%%Should you manage to defeat all enemies and complete the Fall of Hope, you get the special Perk Destroyer of Hope. Which grants you a very large boost in power while attacking beings that are in a high position in their organisation, with an extra boost if those people could be considered Heroic.,,
A Spark, ignited,,5,,00,,False,,True,,Around a week before your Jump would end Cosmos and Void will be attacked by an unknown Cosmic being. This being has traced back your steps(Jumps) and desires nothing more than to devour you and make all your powers its own. On its own it is strong enough to kill Cosmos and Void, though it would not emerge unscathed from such a fight. You have to aid Cosmos and Void as fast as possible, as their death would mean the destruction of two infinite Multiverses worth of beings, as well as the loss of two pretty nice Cosmic entities.%%%%Even with Cosmos and Void supporting you, you will have a hard fight ahead of you. Should you be able to kill the being you will be rewarded with your Planeswalker Spark igniting, ending your chain, but symbolizing the start of new adventures in this infinite Omniverse. You will also gain the full form of Cosmos and Void as companions, the two of them being very thankful that you helped them, yes even Void.,,
