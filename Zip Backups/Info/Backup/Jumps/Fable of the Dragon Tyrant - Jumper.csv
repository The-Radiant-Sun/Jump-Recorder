True Innocent,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are a simple soul, and it’s through your words that wisdom even the old men can’t deny comes. This is the path of the obvious and the simple. Death is bad, and losing those you love hurts. Interacting with you is sure to center those that use complex thought to understand the world as it is outside their complexes palaces of thoughts.,,
Dragonologist,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The dragon gives life meaning as its fleeting span makes every moment so much more important. Your time is limited and you must make the most of it. You administer the dragon related parts of the government, and it’s with your aid that the trains full of people are full and on time. It’s by your departments work that pensions are given to the families of those taken to the dragon.,,
Anti-Dragonist,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,The world has changed, and while others can’t see it you can. While no plan to hurt the dragon ever succeeded before you have to try. New technology is constantly being made. With the work all of you are doing it’s finally possible, you’re sure of it. Chose one of the specialties below.%%%%Rocket Science:%%Literal rocket science. Getting things from one place on a planet to another is simple for you given the right tools and supplies. It just takes time.%%%%Material Science:%%To harm the dragon is going to require materials at least as tough as the dragon, and you can’t use the composite material without understanding how they act on a rocket near such extreme heat.%%%%Bioengineering:%%To understand your foe is the first step to being able to counter them. You know the dragon as well as any, and better than most. It’s your work that got the scales used to test the materials that make the rocket.,,
Dragon,,0,,-10000,,True,,False,,You’re a beast of terrible size. You start nearly as large as the dragon at the start of the story and will grow larger with time. To make this clear you are the villain of this story.%%%%Other Dragon or Kaiju forms may be imported into this.,,
Ageless Youth,,1,,00,,True,,True,,None in this world age past their late 20’s. You will never age past your prime in any form that isn’t already past it, and will slowly regain youth over years. Aging backwards at 1 year in 1 year.,,
Noble Knight,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,Though the knights of old failed to slay the dragon you carry on their legacy and hone the skills they used to protect the kingdom.%%%%Should you ever find medieval weapons or armor on hand you may use it with the skill of a professional after only a few moments to adjust to the specifics of that item. A double edged straight sword if very different in combat from a single edged scimitar after all.,,
Writer,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have the skills of a great writer. With time and effort you could carve your name in the pages of history among those who influenced the very act of writing. Mary Shelly may have written the first Sci-Fi, but you are capable of at least that level of fame given time and effort. Maybe you’ll write guides to the powers of the world you’re in and change the way it’s run forever. Be the Gohan of your own story and share your “ki” with the world.,,
Wizardry - Adaptive,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,While magic here may be real it failed to slay the dragon. Now you too may learn the magic of this world. When you picture this magic imagine Gandalf. It can do much, but it always seems to fail you in some way when you’d need it for the plot, such as the Balrog, unless you’re against a magic user.%%%%When you pick this perk you must pick a general theme for your magic such as nature, growth, or technology that all your magic conforms to in some way.,,
True Innocent - Good and Evil,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,True understanding of good and evil. With a moment of though you can pierce to the heart of any issue, and even the best rhetoric fails to deceive you.%%%%As long as you have enough information you can always tell right from wrong. Most people say this is the easy part, they’re wrong.%%%%There are many terrible evils pretending to be good.,,
True Innocent - Light in the Dark,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Your presence acts as a motivational force to those around you. As long as you stand with them they know they’re on the side of angels.%%%%This power fails if you attempt to support something at least as bad as murder, and takes at least a week to recover.,,
True Innocent - Moral Plee,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Cut through rhetoric and posturing with simple plees provided they are truly for a moral cause.%%%%Just as the boy pleading for the return of his grandmother cut through the rhetoric of the advisor on morality you too can pierce any defence that isn’t genuinely moral.,,
Dragonologist - Chosen Profession,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Choose a profession a government would need.%%%%You’re now competent at that job. Additionally you’re as good at PR as you are at the highest governmental job you’re capable of doing.,,
Dragonologist - Expert,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,As above, but you are now an expert with few peers.%%%%With a little work you could likely get into a position of significant power, maybe even advising the king. Even the best have to climb the ladder to reach the top.,,
Dragonologist - Necessary Evil,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Sometimes the only way to prevent harm is to inflict a lesser harm.%%%%You’re now capable of working towards the greater good even when you would normally be crippled by fears, insecurities, and revulsion.%%%%You may now suppress your emotions in order to complete tasks you know must be done. The thing most people fail to get about necessary evil is that it is in fact necessary.,,
Anti-Dragonist - Experimentation,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have an understanding of the scientific process. You can construct experiments with almost no flaws, but you gain no other knowledge.%%%%This on it’s own only offers nearly unparalleled skill at experimental design, but no scientific knowledge.,,
Anti-Dragonist - Doctor of ####,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Your chosen subtype is now a doctoral level understanding of the subject even if there should be no way that this quasi-medieval setting should have one yet. This lets you know everything you need to make the tools to make the tools to make the tools you need to practice your subject matter expertise.%%%%This may only be purchased once.%%%%%%Those that did not take the anti-dragonist origin instead gain a masters level understanding in all three. This significantly reduces your ability in any one field, and would not be enough on its own to make any groups portion of the rocket due to the complexity involved. You are however perfect for interacting between groups of scientists.%%%%You can understand everyone, and that makes it easier to ease cooperation between research groups. You joined their cause too late to complete a doctorate in time to help, but that doesn’t mean you’re just going to stand back and not help in some way.,,
Anti-Dragonist - Ahead of your time,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Even if this setting shouldn’t have rockets when the king is riding out to go slay tigers in person you can make them given the aid of others in the needed fields.%%%%This lets you make things 75 (alone) to 400 years (with help/superior materials) in advance of the setting via clever use of lesser mechanisms and true understanding of your subject. The rocket will look like something from The Earth to the Moon, but it’ll work all the same.%%%%This is true for anything you know how to make.,,
Dragon - Endless Growth and Gnawing Hunger,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mandatory and exclusive for Dragon%%%%You grow in size slowly, but without limits. Your hunger reflects this. You must eat at least 1?3 your bodyweight per week or die in less then a month from starvation.,,
Dragon - True Power,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mandatory and exclusive for Dragon%%%%None weaker then you may question your right to command them. This has no effect on those more powerful than you. They have no requirement to help you in anything you don’t directly say, and will likely try to subvert your commands. This applies to all combat power.%%%%Should you break their will to resist in some way they’ll stay broken aiming only to placate you so that you do not visit your wrath upon them.%%%%Beware those you haven’t broken though, they could potentially lead even those you broke out of despair.,,
Dragon - Unbreakable Armor,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mandatory and exclusive for Dragon%%%%You’re impervious to the weapons of man.%%%%No weapon weaker then an orbital bombardment or a direct missile strike of incredible materials may cause you harm, but even that will not kill you without a material as strong as your scales. Materials like D&D Adamantine are far inferior to your glorious coat of scales.%%%%You do shed scales over time for new larger ones to grow in though.,,
Dragon - Engine of Death,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Mandatory and exclusive for Dragon%%%%While your form comes with claws and teeth that are larger and more powerful than siege weapons, a musculature that allows even a dragon without Squaring the Cube to casually grow to the size of a mountain range before the loss of proportional strength is possible.%%%%You possess the ability to fly despite that size from the strength of your wings this makes you more terrible still.%%%%You can bellow forth great gouts of flame to consume all that would oppose you.%%%%None may oppose your strength on equal terms without the might of gods behind them for your great mass cannot be matched once you have grown.,,
Dragon - Terror Unending,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are a nightmarish creature that invokes fear at least as bad as Cthulhu when you are angry.%%%%While this can be toggled off after this setting the power is locked on for the duration of your time in this world. Keep your temper in check if you don’t want to kill people out of terror of your wrath.%%%%This terror of your wrath forces those subjected to it to age prematurely. Days in your presence while this is active age them months. The terror of you pushing them ever closer to death before you even raise your claw.%%%%Those that work for you may experience joy and relief at your presence for they see the value you give to life with your shortening of it.,,
Dragon - Toxic Bite,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,You produce a set of chemicals that makes your bite toxic.%%%%None may survive the lightest grazing of your teeth.%%%%This is toggleable after this jump, but the duration of your time here it is a fact of life that your bite kills, invariably and painfully.%%%%While this is active your saliva is a yellowish-green slime. Additionally this chemical concoction breeds disease.%%%%Should you keep this perk active for more than a day your very breath will lay low those near you with terrible diseases, even those not seen in decades or centuries.,,
Dragon - Dark Gods,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You are a power far more terrible than the allegorical age of the original dragon. You are the father of sickness or the mother of despair. You do not take merely the old, all will tremble before your power.%%%%Your merest touch reduces your foes to a trembling quaking mess.%%%%A wound you inflict reduces them to a bedridden state as a terrible disease takes hold. That’s not the true strength of this power though.%%%%You are a dark god, and those you allow to survive your wound take a fragment of your power for themselves.%%%%Each time you wound them and allow them to live they gain a power at 1/10th the strength of yours. If you’re doing this deliberately you may choose which power it is. If this was not intentional then they gain a random perk at 1/10th strength. This power can never be turned off, but it only applies to wounds you inflict personally.%%%%Each wound they take from you is a new and terrible disease released into the world. May even Father Nergal fear your wrath.,,
Transhuman Writings,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,The full writings of all Transhuman authors native to your homeworld, and some beyond, such as Nick Bostrom, Mary Shelley, Arthur C. Clarke, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and others will be placed in a massive bookshelf in your warehouse. Should you prefer they’ll be placed on a handheld tablet in your warehouse instead.%%%%This is the full and complete collection of all published transhuman authors and all they’ve ever written. Use it well.,,
True Inocent - A Keepsake,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A small non-magical keepsake of a loved one you’ve lost. Just looking at it restores your will to keep going. You know they’d want for you to live a good life for them.,,
True Inocent - Moral Compass,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,This isn’t a true compass. It’s an item from someone you trust, and when you think about them and listen you can hear the advice they’d give you if you asked them about the current situation.%%%%The person in question must be chosen when this item is created, and can’t be changed.%%%%While you could likely do this before the emotions tied into this dear gift make it far easier to think in the way of this person.,,
True Inocent - Lenience,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,Something in your past has allowed you to be places you shouldn’t and say things you shouldn’t with no major repercussions.%%%%This only applies when no harm is ment, but some combination of your reputation and the favor of those in charge turn aside all but very serious charges when you’re only trying to help.,,
Dragonologist - Competent Workforce,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,When you fund or lead a project you won’t get applicants of less than the needed skill for it. This doesn’t get you workers if your project would be impossible in the current setting.,,
Dragonologist - Logistics,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,Everything runs on time. Like in Japan a train being a minute late is front page news.%%%%This is true now regardless of what it is as long as you own or operate it.,,
Dragonologist - Taxpayers Dollars,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The wealth of a small kingdom is at your beck and call. Less than $1 Billion per year. This must be spent on something that would benefit the people in some way, but other then that the choice is up to you.%%%%This comes with a government job in each new setting.%%%%Quitting your job stops the supply of funds.,,
Anti-Dragonist - Dragon Blood Sample,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A sample of dragon’s blood. Good for cloning more dragon parts if you can do so. Getting this blood sample was the work of dozens of now dead. Don’t let their sacrifice be in vain.%%%%You gain 1 vial of blood containing a few ounces of dragon blood per jump.,,
Anti-Dragonist - Dragonkiller Schematics,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,The rocket that was used to kill the dragon. With these it’ll be far faster to slay such a beast. This does not come with the skill you use these.%%%%This missile can kill most things, but works best on massive foes.,,
Anti-Dragonist - Dragon Scales,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,The toughest material that can exist. Hard, but brittle. You gain a shipping container full per year. The composite material used in the rocket trades some rigidity for the bit of flexibility to survive forces that cause fracturing of the scales.%%%%Just as bones break under forces that merely deform high quality steel these scales are the bones to the composite’s steel.,,
Dragon - Tribute,,2,,00,,True,,True,,Dragon only%%%%Ten thousand live humans a day on trains that arrive in precise 20 minute intervals. The trains leave once empty.,,
Dragon - Mountain,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A mountain nearly as large as an elder dragon. A good place to rest for one so old. This one is largely hollowed out to hold the mass of people needed to feed you.,,
Dragon - Rails,,2,,-3000,,True,,True,,You may add a rail network with a single hub station to any setting. The trains run on precice 20 minute intervals. Useful for transportation provided you’re the size of the local population. For the duration of this jump this increases the amount of people you’re brought to eighty thousand.%%%%You may increase this number, but it will not drop lower than this number.,,
Dragon - Land of despair,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,The kingdom sans it’s people. This blighted landscape instills a feeling of great dread. While the buildings are all intact, food will rot and spoil.,,
Import,,3,,00,,False,,False,,Human Only%%%%This world is pretty bleak until the dragon is slain. Take 4 Companions for free for support. All companions come with 600 CP, and none may take Dragon under any circumstances.,,
Additional Companions,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Human Only%%%%You may purchase two additional companions with 600 CP each. This may be purchased unlimited times.,,
Innocent - Passing of the Baton,,5,,00,,False,,True,,The plees of the child fell on deaf ears. The second conference is about to begin. The child is now a young man and the world still hasn’t changed. You and he are both in the conference and your opponents are the minister for morality in the kingdom and a leading dragonist. You must not just defeat them in debate, but also keep public interest in the project high enough that it gets completed no more than 13 years later.%%%%This will not be an easy task for lifetimes of work by the dragonists insures that most people think only of the “good” the dragon brings.%%%%%%Reward: Never Say Goodbye, It’s Until Next Time%%A small piece of this world is carried with you. Where you go old age and infirmity fade.%%%%Those you interact with grow to be truly unaging over a year at most, and your mere presence on a world extends the lives of those on it. Should you spend a decade on a single world the population would have a lifespan better measured centuries. Just as your words gave true hope against the dragon here your existence is now a black eye to death itself.%%%%Entities embodying death are unlikely to think fondly of you no matter what perks you have.,,
Dragonist - Maintain the Age,,5,,00,,False,,True,,Prevent the slaying of the dragon and the ushering in of an age free of the tyrant.%%%%By the end of your jump there must be no attempt to slay the dragon with an official sanction. The child will give his armor piercing plee. You can’t allow this to sway the opinion of the crowd.%%%%If by the end of your decade none have got approval for the funding of an anti-dragon weapon you win this scenario.%%%%%%Reward: The Status Quo is King%%Any time someone would try and change the status quo of the local or national area in a way you’d disapprove of you know it and what they plan to do to change it.%%%%Should you make an effort the skills you learned here will make such attempts fruitless. With careful work you can ruin their political capital while keeping your own. If you play your cards right you should be able to set a least a few government policies a year.%%%%Additionally, if you’re working for a provable higher power such as a god that intervenes directly, or a great dragon that rules the land none will take your actions personally, after all, you were just following orders.,,
Anti-Dragonist - Slay the Dragon,,5,,00,,False,,True,,Slay the dragon before the decade is out. It will be a desperate rush to finish the rocket two full years ahead of schedule. Setbacks will get in the way of completing the rocket on time, but with the aid of just these perks you’ll be working long shifts to get everything done on time.%%%%%%Reward: Just in Time%%Time never seems to be on the side of the hero, but you always seem to make it just in the knick of time.%%%%When you’re working on a project things go smoothly, taking at most 1?3 of the time it would normally take, but should you be on a crunch with lives on the line things just seem to fall into place so that you can complete it on time. It’ll be exhausting work, but if you rush you just may be able to complete your magic bullet right in time.,,
Dragon - Rule Uncontested,,5,,00,,True,,True,,Maintain power for the next century without sustaining injury. While the humans are no better then they are in story the rocket will arrive on the twelfth year, and nothing you do may delay that short of killing a sizable chunk of the population.%%%%While any scenario is active the trains that feed you will have no fiat backing, and as such maystart to run empty if the population is reduced too far.%%%%%%Reward: Tyrant Jumper%%Should you succeed in maintaining your rule without opposition you may rule as you did while a dragon. As long as none have harmed you physically in a way that they can prove none may contest your right to rule over others. Should they succeed in harming your image of invincibility you will need to reestablish it or rebellion may well start. This does not exempt them from the law, and should they harm you where it is illegal if they can prove it they’ll likely be charged criminally for it. This is a poor consolation prize, but at least it’s something.,,
Dragon - Living Disaster,,5,,00,,True,,True,,Take the “Courage of Fools” drawback for no points. For the duration of this jump or thirty years minimum whichever is less you must survive as the dragon. Attacks will start a decade in, and by the 25th year will be occurring on average around once a week. While the initial attack will be the normal missile the later attacks will grow stronger and stronger.%%%%Any attempt to obviously do anything other then tank the hits will only encourage them, and killing more than half the human population will result in a chain failure. Fleeing the world will only buy you 2 years at most before they’re infesting the solar system, and fleeing the system only buys you 2 more years stills. They will hunt you as their dearest calling and nothing but your final death will stop their endless assault.%%%%%%Reward: Squaring the Cube%%The square cube law no longer applies to your alt-forms. Growing in size does not slow you down or weaken you proportionally to your increase. You can be larger than the earth and still move with the same proportional strength as a human. This does not negatively impact smaller forms. They retain their proportional strength even while this is active. The larger forms still take longer to react, though even that effect is reduced. The speed of light is only so fast after all.%%%%An entity the size of Galactus with the proportional strength of men would be something even a modern kryptonian at their prime wouldn’t be able to do much about. Additionally your skin counts as dragon scale for purposes of damage resistance. It’s just the thickness of regular skin. Beware monomolecular blades while you are the size of a human.,,
Human - On the List,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Your name is on the list of people to be fed to the dragon. The rich can bribe the collectors to gain more time, but none may be exempted forever. On the 6th year of this jump it will no longer be possible to bribe your way off the trains.,,
Human - Deep Loss,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,The dragon has taken someone from you, and you can never get them back%%%% If you’re a Drop-In this will be one of your companions, but this perk will be worth +600 CP as they’re gone for good.%%%%(Cannot take as Drop-In without companions from a prior jump.),,
Human - Crippling Depression,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You cannot motivate yourself to do anything about your foe/s. While you can be pushed to work you can’t motivate yourself to do more than the minimum to stay healthy.,,
Human - Blight Upon the Land,,4,,10000,,False,,False,,A second dragon equal to the other is present in the kingdom.%%%%%%For humans this means that any attack that doesn’t kill both at once is certain to alert the second dragon to the threat and the chance of killing it tank to nearly nothing.%%%%Additionally alt-forms are unusable for the duration of this jump regardless of your Background.,,
Dragon - Unending Hunger,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You must eat at least your body weight every 3 days or start starving. This can only be fed through the flesh of animals, and increases the speed of your growth by a similar amount.,,
Dragon - Forever Alone,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Though your face cannot show it much of your rage is from the loss of your lesser kin to the humans.%%%%You may not agree to work with them for anything, and you eat them out of spite for their actions even though you could have just made them raise cows for you.,,
Dragon - Courage of Fools,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Your might is unquestioned, but the humans will never stop attempting to kill you. You would cull their numbers, but they barely number enough to feed you as is. There is nothing you can do to stop them from working towards your death.,,
Dragon - Blight Upon the Land,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,A second dragon equal to the other is present in the kingdom.%%%%For dragons this means a second dragon that is your equal in might if not specific powers with an equal need for food also lives in this kingdom.%%%%Should the two of you not somehow encourage the people of the land to grow their population, and quickly, there will not be enough people to feed you both. Work quickly or find a way to slay your equal as you’re growing faster than their population.%%%%Additionally alt-forms are unusable for the duration of this jump regardless of your Background.,,
