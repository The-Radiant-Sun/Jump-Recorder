Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You just show up at the location of choice, with no new memories, no friends, and no history of this world to either help you or hold you back.,,
Commoner,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are a commoner in your starting area. You have known hard work since the day you were born. You are well known and well liked in the village or city in your starting area and are seen as a pillar of the community.,,
Rebel,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are a rebel that opposed the rule of King Galbatorix and his Empire. Whether you are with the Varden, Surda, an independent group or even by yourself matters not. In the end you are a fighter against tyranny and fight you must. You begin in a safe house or location in your starting area.,,
Sorcerer,,0,,-4000,,True,,False,,You are one of the few born with the natural ability to manipulate magic. Magic is the art of thinking; A true master could use the word of “Water” and create something completely unrelated though the relation has to be clear in their mind. Magic is dependent upon the caster’s vital energy, so be careful not to overstep one's bounds.,,
Rider,,0,,-6000,,False,,False,,The Dragon Riders were a coalition of elves and dragons formed at the end of Du Fyrn Skulblaka to forge peace and order between the elves and dragons. Thousands of years later, humans were also added to the elite order of the Dragon Riders. The Riders were keepers of the peace throughout the land of Alagaësia, they were healers, scholars and the strongest magicians throughout the land and were respected and honored by the people they served. Well that was before the fall, now you are one of the few Riders left alive. Better keep your head down. You are either one of the survivor of the fall or you are one of the lucky few to gain a dragon egg.,,
Human,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The primary inhabitants of Alagaësia, though not native to it, along with the elves, Urgals, and Ra'zac, humans came from some unknown continent across the Western Sea in ages past. Humans made up the vast majority of the citizens within the Broddring Empire. Some served in the army, but most were simply common peasants. Other humans were members of the Varden and citizens and warriors of Surda.,,
Dwarves,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,One of the only races native to Alagaësia. Known as lovers of rock and stone, dwarves had a long lifespan and often lived in large, underground cities in the Beor Mountains. Dwarves have thicker bones than other races and have seven toes on each foot. The dwarves were split into thirteen distinct miniature societies called clans. Each clan had its own clan chief, who was a member of the Council. The thirteen clan chiefs were responsible for electing a king: the king was the final authority over all the clans. You may choose which of the thirteen clan you belong to. See notes for it.,,
Elves,,0,,-6000,,True,,True,,A race of beings who migrated to Alagaësia from Alalëa in the distant past. Humanoid in appearance, they had noticeably angular features, slanting eyebrows and pointed ears, as well as a feline face. They were generally tall and always slim.%%%%Most elves were more gifted with magic than the other races and had an innate knowledge of their true names, thus making them more powerful than other races.%%%%Possessing superior senses, strength, speed and they also are ageless, capable of living forever barring accident or violence.,,
Werecats,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,Werecats are sentient creatures with shapeshifting abilities, being able to take on the appearance of either a human or a large, shaggy cat. Whether they migrated to Alagaësia or were native to the land is unknown.%%%%They are quite rare: the few who are alive during Eragon's time do not often reveal themselves. Werecats can also command regular cats as well as their own kind.,,
Urgal,,0,,1000,,False,,True,,A race of sentient creatures that inhabit Alagaësia. Considered evil by most humans, but are not inherently so.%%%%Though most are uneducated in the normal definition of the word, they make up for this with brute strength, as well as exceptional combat and commanding skills.%%%%Six to nine feet tall, with seven toes on each foot as Dwarves have. They have yellow, piggish eyes, claws on their hands in place of nails and a pair of long, twisted horns protruding from above their ears.%%%%Their entire culture revolves around violence and physical strength: one's prestige being directly connected with how many kills one had or how many opponents they had beaten in combat as well as their size and the size of their horns. Their horns actually are a sign of pride, if an urgal were to lose his horns it would be considered being stripped of his being and manhood.%%%%On average Urgals have lifespans similar to humans, they are stronger, faster and can run for much longer distances than any human or dwarf.%%%%Forced by Durza into the service of Galbatorix at the beginning of the jump. You are one of those in Durza army.,,
Ra'zac,,0,,2000,,False,,True,,The Ra'zac (or Lethrblaka when full-grown, see notes) were one of several ancient races that were thought to have followed the humans across the sea to Alagaësia. They were a race that fed on humans and likely came from the same homelands.%%%%Ra'zacs' breath have the power to paralyze humans into a dream-like state, however, it barely clouds the minds of dwarves and is ineffective against elves altogether. Their minds are also shielded and invisible from mental powers.%%%%The last two Ra'zac to live before the extinction of their race in Alagaësia (as well as the remaining two Lethrblaka) were servants of Galbatorix, living in their black towers at Helgrind. You now are the third adult Ra'zac, you start at Helgrind.,,

Dwarf - Patience,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have the patience of a rock, able to put up even the most irritating of persons or events. It doesn’t matter how a person might grate on you, you can ignore them unless you choose to make it a conscious choice to be affected.,,
Elf - Half-Truth,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The language of the elves prevents them from ever speaking a lie in their native tongue. You have learned this well and don’t lie nor do you tell falsehoods, you speak in half-truths. You don’t have to of course, you’re simply astounding good at it.,,
Werecat - Prophecy,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,From time to time you receive a prophecy that may aid you in your endeavor. Usually very cryptic and hard to understand but always providing insight and aid you would never have found otherwise.,,
Urgal - Kull,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are among the tallest and most powerful of the Urgals, the Kull, standing above eight feet tall on average and have legs like a tree trunk. Other races beside Urgal that buy this, will be at greatest height of what their race is capable of with a similar increase in physical ability.,,
Ra'zac - Enhanced Senses,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Your senses were very strong: they could track scents like hounds, see on a cloudy night or even in complete darkness. This also comes with a protection to sudden brightness.,,
Mental Shields,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You form mental shields over your mind, making it hard for magic to penetrate your thoughts and mind unless you allow it to do so. For an extra 100 CP, you also get the “Mental Swords" i.e. countering attempts at intrusion by "poking" their minds using “useless” data/memory when it appears that your guard is down.,,Purchased at second tier
Protected Name,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,The magic of this world is powerful and can be used to do many things, many terrible things in the case of someone knowing your ‘True Name’. You are, however, somehow immune to this fate. Your True Name cannot be used by others, either positively or negatively, nor can you be bound by it.

Magic,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Free for Sorcerer, Rider, and Elf%%%%You can wield the powers of Magic, granting you the dual powers of psychic combat and semantic mysticism. By speaking "The Ancient Language" you can cause changes to happen in the world, conforming to the words you state.%%%%This power is fueled by your physical energy however, and to do something with magic takes as much energy as doing it via the mundane method, it simply happens faster or more conveniently.%%%%At first you must spell out exactly what you want to happen, but as you grow more experienced with Magic you can do more with smaller sentences. You must still find someone to learn from if you wish to expand your vocabulary beyond the basics.,,
Drop In - Hunter,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Hunting, tracking and trapping are second nature to you, with this you are now able to live off the land. You are also good with the bow.,,
Drop In - Exceptionally Skillful,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Your training is outstanding, honed over years and years of hardship, hard work and oftentimes at great personal risk. You are like a tempered blade, flexible, sharp, and strong.%%%%You are capable of fighting elves and shades with nothing but pure skill, not on par but close enough that you won’t died within second of the fight.%%%%Choose one of the following to be a grandmaster of; hand-to-hand combat, melee combat, or archery.%%%%May be purchased more than once, with each purchase being for a separate category.,,Purchased 3 times.

Drop In - Double Triple Quadruple Backstab,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Your goals are... convoluted to say the least.%%%%You can easily enough immerse yourself into a group of people, and as long as you don’t act overly suspicious with your actions they will never see the backstab coming.%%%%The longer you remain with the group the more devastating the backstab will be, and the less they will expect it.,,
Drop In - Hero Killer,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You know those Heroes? Main Protagonists? Those people who prance around with all sorts of plot armor and come out the other side of the worst the universe has to throw at them smelling like roses? Well, you sir, are a Hero Killer!%%%%Your blade and magic are able to pierce plot armor like it doesn't exist. It doesn't matter what 'destiny' or the 'plot' dictates. Everyone is equal under your weapon.,,
Commoner - Villager,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are capable in a large number of fields, anything from farm-work, to milling, to basic blacksmithing. While not excelling in any one area, you are capable in many.,,
Commoner - Fortifications,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are capable of fortifying an area to an astounding degree even with little resources.%%%%You could hold off a regiment of the royal army from destroying a tiny village for several days with nothing more than trees and cutting tools as your resources, assuming you had a little bit of time to prepare before they got there.,,
Commoner - Boundless Determination,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You have the will to keep on going no matter what comes your way.%%%%If there is something you truly care about from the bottom of your heart there is nothing people can do to dissuade you from reaching your goal, short of killing you.,,
Commoner - Rousing Speech,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are the mover of people's hearts, easily rallying even the most hopeless to your cause. If you have proven your worths to them, they will follow you to end of the world.%%%%If there is a light at the end of the tunnel, you can bet that they will strive for it with all their worth.,,
Rebel - Fighting Dirty,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,There is no such thing as a clean fight. You fight to survive, you fight using your head, none of that honor nonsense. Feints, tricks, and backhanded techniques, whatever it takes to win.%%%%In the end if it means you live and your enemy is bleeding on the ground then you’re fine with it.,,
Rebel - Propaganda,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are a consummate politician, you know all the tricks, are very good at what you do, and are skillful enough to keep the public happy even in a wartime situation. You also receive a small bonus to your charisma, so people actually like you more too.,,
Rebel - The Trial,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Trial of the Long Knives was a cultural ceremony formed by the Wandering Tribes from the Hadarac Desert to settle disputes.%%%%Now you can do this too, allowing you to settle a dispute by stating a trial, you may choose what type of trial as long as all participants agree to it. Once agreed upon the participants must hold to the wording of the settlement, win or lose.,,
Rebel - Varden Commander,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You are a talented commander/politician very well regarded by the populace, though your innate political acumen is not infallible.%%%%The main advantage of this perk is it lets you approach rulership from creative, unconventional and surprisingly cost effective angles like funding your armies with lace.%%%%This also gives you a decently high rank in whatever faction you choose to start as a member of in this jump.,,
Sorcerer - Scholar,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You find it easier to retain information after a long period of study. You are able to retain focus even when going for far longer than normal when studying.

Sorcerer - Herbalism,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are skilled with plant and animal parts and can use them to make a number of useful potions, poisons, and poultices.%%%%You gain a kind of sixth sense of what can used and how to bring the best effect in potions or elixirs, and by studying the materials at hand you can find the best ways to use it. This applies to ingredients you may find in future worlds as well.,,
Sorcerer - Spirits,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You can call upon the spirits of the world around you, not the dead but "natural" beings of magic that answer your call. They can allow you to wield great and devastating powers, both making your Magic more powerful and widespread, and making you faster and stronger as a person. Be warned, if you aren't careful with them the Spirits could overtake you, turning you into a monstrous Shade with no control over your actions.,,
Sorcerer - Intentional Magic,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Nonverbal magic here is ridiculously dangerous in that even the most powerful of magicians (if they know it at all) only use it for low risk spells, unfortunately those are also the smallest of spells.%%%%For you see the Ancient Language is not magic in and of itself but instead is a safety measure implemented by the Grey Folk. By using magic nonverbally, you are actually using magic directly with your will. It is faster and more flexible if you have the will and the focus to not be a walking disaster.%%%%Fortunately for you, you are now no longer bound by such limitations. You are capable of using magic for the highest level of spells using nothing but your pure will with no risk at all to yourself.%%%%You also gain the necessary focus for such a feat, as well a talent at nonverbal magic. This applies to all magics you learn from now on.,,

Rider - Bond,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Should you forge an actual bond with someone it is for life.%%%%Almost nothing can make you two betray one another, and you grow stronger and fight harder in each other's presence.,,
Rider - Better to Ask Forgiveness,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,As long as you actually mean your apology - or are a damn good actor and have them completely convinced that you truly mean it - people will basically forget your smaller crimes, bigger crimes tend to be harder but if you work hard enough for your “redemption”, you will get off with a slap on the wrist.,,
Rider - Perfection of Form,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Free for Elf%%%%Your body twists and changes over time and your imperfections fade away. You become a thing of beauty to behold, or at least what you personally believe to be beautiful.%%%%Your strength and speed increase significantly, where before you were a normal human now you can equal or even exceed one of the Elves in straight combat.,,
Companion,,3,,00,,False,,False,,You get new 1 companions for 50 CP and each addition companion costs 50 CP. They get a free background and any freebie associated with their background, with 400 CP to spend except Rider, they don’t get any CP. They are friendly and loyal companions. Their appearance and gender are up to you. You can also import your old companions from previous jump or mix and match your companions as you wish. They may not take drawbacks or purchase companions of their own.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,00,,False,,True,,You can choose to recruit any canon companion of your choice but you must convince them to follow you willingly. 200 CP for regular companion and 300 CP for the magical kind.,,
Werecat,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have made friends with a Werecat, a secretive and enigmatic race that always seems to know what's going on.

Dragon,,3,,-6000,,False,,True,,Free for Rider%%%%A Dragon is a powerful and intelligent creature that will continue to grow until the day it dies. Note that this growth is very slow after the first year or two, a Dragon hundreds of years old is maybe 50% larger than one that is a year and a half old.%%%%Incredibly powerful physically and magically, though their magic can only be used sporadically and not even they can control it.%%%%For Riders you established a Mental Bond with the dragon immediately after it hatched from an egg, you and the Dragon share a mental connection and share everything, they can even lend you their strength for Magic.%%%%For others you are simply close friends with a Dragon, and they are willing to help you solve problems using their brute strength.%%%%May import a companion into this role.,,
Money,,2,,-500,,False,,False,,Cold hard cash, enough for several nights at a high class Inn or you could buy an entire farm complete with tools and livestock at the minimum.,,
An Ancient Language Dictionary,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,Free with Magic%%%%At the beginning, the endless pages of this book are empty but as you learn more of the Ancient Language, it will fill up with the knowledge of that word including proper grammar and such. Post-Jump, this book will act as a true Dictionary and Encyclopedia that fills itself as your adventures continue on.%%%%The book itself will always open directly to the page you desire to read, and is never larger than an ordinary dictionary.,,
Anti-Scrying Amulet,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This amulet appears as little more than a worn stone vaguely shaped like a hammer. Its effect activates when someone attempts to scry on the wearer, glowing and becoming slightly warm. The stone prevents the user or their surroundings from being seen through the effects of mystical scrying.%%%%This does not come without cost however as it draws on the user's own reserves of power to fuel this function. As such, if someone attempts to scry on the wearer for too long, the user may be drained of their energy. Of course the wearer may remove this at any time but this would allow them to be scryed again.,,
Drop In - Weapon of Choice,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,A simple medieval weapon such as a bastard sword or a bow and arrow. Remarkably well crafted, these tools of battle require no maintenance and will be as clean, sharp and flexible as they day they were crafted. You may instead import any existing medieval weapon into this position.,,

Commoner - A Hammer,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,Formerly the hammer of smith, it has been repurposed, its handle extended and its head reshaped into a weapon of war. It is heavy and easily able to crush a man’s skull even in the most unwieldy of hands. In time, it will break, but never before its wielder. You may instead import any existing tool into this position.,,
Commoner - Ship,,2,,-2000,,False,,False,,A high quality ship that can sail the waters and even survive a whirlpool with a little effort. Armed with a couple of ballista for defense that must be manned. You may import a vehicle to grant it the appearance of a ship.,,
Rebel - A Dagger,,2,,-1000,,True,,False,,This ornate dagger is embedded with jewels and is paired with an equally elegant sheath. While appearing as mere decorative jewelry on first sight, it is in every way a functional, if mundane weapon.%%%%It may be safely hidden on your person and will never be found unless drawn. You may instead import an existing small bladed weapon into this position.,,
Rebel - A Set of Armour,,2,,-2000,,False,,False,,This set of armor (your choice of what kind) is said to have been worn by the old dragon riders of Alagaësia. It has been mystically enchanted to withstand force beyond what mere steel could bare and allows the user to move freely as if unencumbered by the weight without decreasing it.%%%%It grants several other minor benefits such as never chaffing or rusting, and never being a burden on any beast the wearer rides.,,
Sorcerer - A Focus,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,A simple magical focus such as a jewel, ornament or rod. With it in hand you may easily clear and organize your thoughts, focusing them through the aid of your tool, allowing you to create and unleash your magic with much less time and a reduced chance of the effects backfiring. You may instead import an existing magical focus into this position.,,
Sorcerer - Talisman,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A Talisman, usually in the form of a highly polished and flawless crystal inlaid into a piece of jewelry is able to store your energy for future use.%%%%If you are exhausted you may regain energy by drawing it out of the talisman or use it instead to fuel any spell that you may cast. Its storage capacity is finite however and likely cannot store more than half a day’s exertion.%%%%If lost or stolen it will return to you within a day’s time.,,
Rider - Harness,,2,,-1000,,False,,False,,Free with Dragon%%%%A harness designed for a Dragon to allow the Rider to sit comfortably on their Dragon's back without the scales tearing up the legs.,,
Rider - Rider's Blade,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A sword made out of Brightsteel by the Elven smith Rhunön. It is of extremely high quality and will never break, it also matches the scales of your Dragon if you have one.%%%%It is expected to be given a name in the Ancient Language, and the name is engraved on the blade.%%%%You may also import any melee weapon you own to take on the appearance and strengths of the sword.,,
Belt of Beloth the Wise,,2,,-4000,,False,,False,,Known to some as The Belt of The Twelve Stars, it’s a long black and blue sword belt. Pulling on a tassel at the end of the belt reveals twelve diamonds, four of the stones are black, four are white and the remainder are red, blue, yellow, as well as brown.%%%%Together these stones are able to store an almost unlimited amount of magical energy. The belt itself is warded against scrying and cannot be detected by mystical means, no matter how much power may be stored within it.,,
Eldunari,,2,,-6000,,False,,False,,The true center of a dragon, disgorged permanently from their body. While their body may have continued to function until its death this gem contains the Dragon’s very heart and soul. It is however blind and deaf to the world and can only communicate through direct mental contact.%%%%As it no longer needs to support its body, all of its magic and power remains concentrated eternally within this crystal.%%%%If one can make mental contact with the dragon it may aid you, providing you with an incredible amount of magical energy with which to fuel your spells. It is also a highly sage being, bearing knowledge and wisdom from bygone era’s. It may yet contain many secrets that the riders sought to hide away from the world.,,
Early Begginings,,4,,00,,False,,False,,You start 110 years before the Books begin, and a few years before Galbatorix begins his rise to power.%%%%You'll be involved directly in the destruction of The Riders one way or another.,,
Stutter,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You have a terrible Stutter and have a hard time getting a sentence out straight. It will make interacting with people difficult and pronouncing the true language will take significantly more time and effort.,,
Angela's Attention,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Every town you go to has the same fortune teller. They're somehow still alive regardless of any actions you make, they always tell a fortune that references a grim fate, and you will wind up visiting their tent at some point.%%%%They're also exceedingly critical of everything you wear and use (due to somehow having the knowledge of what you really are).,,
Word Bound,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Someone with Magic botched a blessing on you, and now you're forced to try and protect others from harm.%%%%You feel any pain the people around you feel and have an insatiable need to try and take the pain for them.,,
Weak Constitution,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Only with Magic%%%%You tire quickly and can barely cast even simple spells.,,
Ra'zac Hunt,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Incompatable with Ra'zac%%%%The Ra'zac, a species that 'evolved' to hunt down and eat Humans, are after you. There are only four of them, two juveniles who have human proportions and two adults whom appear akin to giant bats. They want to eat the marrow from your bones, and will use their physical capabilities to their advantage.%%%%They lack magic themselves, but cannot be detected via supernatural means and are skilled in overcoming foes of an arcane persuasion.,,
Shade's Target,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,A shade for some reason has chosen to hunt you down to kill you. Shades are Sorcerers who have fallen to the Spirits they summoned, and they retain their immense magical might, and are as strong and fast as an experienced Rider.%%%%Few have ever killed one and survived the act.,,
Name Bound,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Someone knows your True Name and can use it to force you to do anything they desire. They will use you mostly as a living weapon for their goals. The only way to escape this is to change enough as a person that your True Name changes, though this is easier said than done.,,
Elves are Always Right,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,For some reason no matter what you do, what you say, or your reasoning behind such things. The Elves will always be right, and there isn't really anything you can do about it. No matter the situation the Elves will always prove to be right, and you will be wrong unless you agree with them.%%%%They will also be incredibly snooty about it, and look down on you for being Human, yes even if you're a Rider, yes even if you’re an elf, especially if you’re an elf they are gonna treat you like a misguided child.%%%%Also no matter what you do you can't seem to kill the bastards.,,
