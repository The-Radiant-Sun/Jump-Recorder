Drop In,,0,,00,,True,,False,,You open your eyes. You are sitting on a bench in a park. You are wearing a top hat and an old fashioned suit. If you are male you have a thin moustache and a goatee beard. Your skin has a pink tinge to it, your body is tall and lean and your hair is a dark brown (verging on red). As you survey the ducks drifting lazily on the pond and the horrible children screaming at their horrible parents you feel an urge to ironically manipulate and punish those around you. You feel crafty, entrepreneurial and downright devilish.%%%%Your body is fit but around middle aged.,,
Alien,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You were born in your local Rick’s lab after he tried to make a hybrid of some of the stranger species of aliens he’s come across (for some not entirely noble reason). You begin at a house party in Rick and Morty’s house, whether as a recent escapee or as a long established experiment turned friend of Rick’s. Whether largely human shaped with different shaped nipples or an amorphous blob of matter with eyes it doesn’t matter much, your abilities set you far apart from humanity.%%%%You are somewhere between a day and 50 years old.,,
Morty,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Oh geez. You are a student at high school and may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but that doesn’t stop you from ending up in all sorts of crazy hijinks.

Your species is largely up to you (there are a lot of universes with a lot of different sorts of Ricks out there) but it may not grant you a significant advantage.

Drop In - A Price for Everything,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Curses! You can curse objects.%%%%The curse affects anyone in possession of the object and can only be dispelled by unnaturally advanced science or magic.%%%%The more ironic the object/curse combination the more powerful it is. Pairs of running shoes that cause people to run till they die, fox boas that skin the user, etc.,,
Drop In - Voodoo Crap Magic,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Are you the devil?
