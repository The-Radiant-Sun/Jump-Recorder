Universal Drawbacks,,6,,107500,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Navy Specialist Officer,,0,,00,,False,,False,,It takes more than firepower and the bravery of our Helldiver troops to spread Managed Democracy and protect the Federation. Picking this origin means you're part of the educated few that directs the scalpel of Super Earth, and rarely have to get your hands dirty yourself. You're either the Admiral responsible for the well-being of the Helldrop Ship, the on-board scientist that gets to conduct unquestioned science upon the Helldivers and whatever they bring back from the planet surface, or the Quartermaster with free license to modify the contents of the armory and is responsible for actually deploying equipment to the planet surface as the Helldivers request it.,,
Private,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Somehow even more nameless and faceless than the clones that never take their helmet off, you supposedly joined the military so that you could be guaranteed citizenship, but nobody relevant to your immediate command even has any information about you.%%%%You're the general help on the ship, and any menial tasks like removing the dead Helldiver from the bridge will be assigned to you. By far the lowest intensity and least risk-taking job the Federation has to offer.,,
Helldiver,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,The scalpel of the Federation, you are permanently based from a Federation Helldrop Ship, get orbitally dropped behind enemy lines in teams of up to four members, avoid the patrols, accomplish your objectives, and then take a shuttle to evac out in a blaze of air-superiority induced glory.%%%%You also die horribly, and thanks to the technology of the Federation, often. Helldivers also make heavy use of “Stratagems”, radioed in air support signaled by beacons that can be thrown like grenades. Stratagems can range from packs of ammo stuffed in a Hellpod, to fully functional turrets dropped out of the sky, to a strafing run request for a nearby Eagle fighter.,,
Cyborg Sympathizer,,0,,-2000,,False,,False,,This Origin can be taken with any other Origin.%%%%There are those among us that want to destroy everything that the Federation stands for, and relate to the plight of our mechanical enemy. Sympathizers can be anything ranging from people that illegally listen to Cyborg broadcasts which claim citizens are brainwashed, all the way to terrorists actively looking to subvert the Federation. All of them are traitors.,,
Illuminate Collaborator,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Illuminate (or the Squ’ith, as they prefer to be called) are an advanced alien race that come from aquatic environs. Their society is built in the pursuit of knowledge in all aspects, down to how their hierarchy is built upon a merit based caste system. As practical as they are, they’re more than fine working with Outsiders that will join their fight with the Federation.,,
Bug,,0,,00,,True,,False,,Evolution is a game, and they are the winners. Growing from hatchling to Helldiver-chomping in a matter of days, spreading from planet to planet via unknown means (perhaps spore-ridden meteors, or unhatched infants launched into space), this mostly mindless horde works symbiotically to slowly but surely infest every planet in the galaxy.%%%%Do not roll for location, you automatically start in the Bug Front.,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,While the war effort ebbs and flows and you may get stationed elsewhere during the jump, your starting location is fiat-backed and you'll more often than not find yourself back attending the post you started at%%%%This fiat is overruled by "Take the Helm".%%%%Roll a six sided die to determine where you start.%%%%[1] The Cyborg Front - You're stationed on Cyberstan’s warpath, either going head to head against the misguided mechanically inclined Cyborg rebels, or fighting arm in arm with your modified comrades. Expect to come up against the heavy armor of cyborg Infantry Fighting Vehicles and metal-encased Warlords, to get knocked down and torn apart by bear trap-mouthed Hounds or chainsaw wielding maniacs, and blown to bits by the heavy ordinance the faction brings to bear if you’re fighting for the Federation.%%%%[2] The Illuminate Front - Put on Fortunate Son, we've got a Squ'bai Shrine to burn. When fighting the supposedly enlightened squid aliens, beware their energy shielded tripods, their laser snipers, their near-invisible melee combatants, the energy-wall generating Obelisks that can separate you from your allies in key moments, and their powerful nanobot controlling masters that can rewire your brain with a projectile attack.%%%%[3] The Bug Front - I'm from Buenos Aires and I say kill 'em all! The Bugs are keen on closing in and eating you, with your death beforehand being optional. These biological terrors can burrow out from the ground beneath you, will keep charging and attacking for a few seconds after you blow off their head, and in the case of their tank units, step on you.%%%%[4] Super Earth - No front like the homefront! You’re the last line of defense for the federation should the enemies of man get far in, and responsible for addressing unrest among the population using the diplomatic skillset available through the Helldivers armory.%%%%[5] Empty Space - Must take the Super Earth Has Fallen drawback or reroll. There's a lot of space out there- if you're looking to avoid the worst of things, it's hard to find a quieter and safer spot than out there.%%%%[6] Your Choice - Lucky you, zooming around the galaxy without any fiat-backed placement. Pick any of the five above as a starting location.,,
For Super Earth!,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,With a simple cry you can froth up any who share your cause, letting them shrug off questionable bodily integrity and fear for their life, as well as pushing them to perform at their peak for about a minute.,,
Militarized Upbringing,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are well accustomed to authority and hierarchy in your life.%%%%You have a sixth sense to divine what is expected of you by a given system of authority, and in the eyes of regulation and “by the book”, you are always equipped with the “right” answer. Whether that answer is advantageous or practical in the moment is another matter entirely.,,
Spacer,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You're at home where gravity is light and the stars are bright.%%%%This perk makes you immune to the effects of space adaptation.%%%%On top of this, descending into the atmosphere of a planet and leaving it is significantly less trying on your body and difficult to accomplish.,,
Navy Specialist Officer - Galactic Department of Corrected Transmissions Pre-Approved,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You're allowed access to the Galactic Wide Web, to speak freely (so long as you aren't blatantly a cyborg sympathizer), and even participate in pastimes that are looked at with suspicion, like lifting weights.%%%%In and out of jump, this makes even the most suspicious authoritative bodies trust you at face value. Whether you can maintain that trust is up to what you do with it.,,
Navy Specialist Officer - Expertise,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,This perk may be taken multiple times. Choose one field of expertise (Weapons Development, Deployment/Grand Strategy, Alien Biology).%%%%You are now an accomplished practitioner of that field- able to act independently and easily continue learning about it.%%%%You also can choose to have an advanced, fully furnished workstation from which to conduct your field of expertise as a warehouse structure.%%%%All workstations gained from this perk would share one structure slot in the warehouse.,,
Navy Specialist Officer - Know Your Enemy,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You only need to establish visual contact with something that wants to kill you to instantly have a profile on it. Said profile will have a common name for the enemy, a generalized 'class' for it (like Tank, Scout, etc), a level of threat it represents. its level of armor, how much punishment it can take, and its weapons of choice.,,
Navy Specialist Officer - Take the Helm,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,In jump, you have final say over all of your strategic decisions- when you strike, where on what planets you do so, what gear to prepare, and which Helldivers you'd consent to working in parallel with.%%%%This perk also grants you gravatas over all manner of tactical and strategic matters, and people who are currently dealing with strategic matters are all but guaranteed to take you and your input seriously.,,
Private - Waiting for my C1-PERM,,1,,-500,,True,,True,,You are able to deflect personal duty, liability, and responsibility for what you've already done so long as you place it on bureaucracy, regardless of feasibility.%%%%This perk isn't effective against those that have first hand evidence to the contrary.,,
Private - I Love Super Earth!,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Through your (and the Federation's) mastery of your mind, you can bring yourself to earnestly and fanatically believe anything so long as you dictate it out loud, with intention.,,
Private - The Silent Majority,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Your voice is the voice of the crowd's. Or at least, close enough.%%%%When you make a judgement call while in the presence of a large number of people, the less impassioned of the masses will find themselves agreeing with you more often than not.,,
Private - What's Your Name Again?,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Something about you just causes memory to slide right off. Even the highly motivated (ie: someone trying to kill you) will have difficulty recalling what direction you ran off to, your name, or even your body type.,,
Helldiver - Reinforced,,1,,00,,True,,True,,This perk requires the Helldiver Origin.%%%%This perk allows you to avoid Jumpchain failure on death.%%%%Whenever your Helldrop ship detects your expiration, a 'blank' clone is shot down into the ground with your most recent kit, and uploads your mind so long as it's within a few hundred feet of where you last met your grisly end.%%%%This perk does not apply if you do not have access to a Helldrop Ship, or if your Helldrop Ship cannot orbitally drop a clone within range of your body.,,
Helldiver - Dropschool Graduate,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You meet the physical expectations set out for Super Earth's Helldivers division. A healthy citizen capable of impressive feats of agility and strength; running a 6 minute mile while hauling a full load of gear, dodging between cyber dogs, teasing Warlord cyborgs by weaving in and out of their hammer arm's reach.%%%%Whether you're able to do those things without practice and plenty of embarrassing deaths is another story.,,
Helldiver - Tactical Retreat,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You navigate the battlefield with ease! You’re able to slip between the ranks of your opponents in all but the most dire of straits. The way out may involve a bit of sprinting, hosing down the nearest mook or five with bullets, taking shrapnel from the grenade shot where you were a few seconds ago and diving into new cover, but it’ll almost always be there, provided you take it before it’s too late.%%%%Your allies within 100 feet will also in-effect have this perk to regroup with you, if you call for them to.,,
Helldiver - Wargear Affinity,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,If it hurts people, you only need a moment or two to familiarize yourself with it enough to make it work. This applies even to complicated things you've never seen before like battle mechs and surface-to-air missiles. Proficiency (and aim) comes with time, however.,,
Helldiver - Friends in High Places,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You're able to coordinate in extreme detail with any cooperative ally from a higher elevation than you so long as you can communicate with them at all, be it through technology, visual cues, or means of communication that you've gained access to through other jumps.%%%%This perk also makes items given by elevated allies much more feasibly deployed and opportunities to do so are easier to come by.,,
Helldiver - Back Into the Fight,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Dying? You’ll have to make do with a helping hand and an auto-injector, the proper medbay is a dozen miles straight above us.%%%%Grievous injury has no effect on your ability to accomplish the task at hand (so long as you still have the relevant limbs), nor does psychological injury that may result from dying and using an extra life.%%%%While you are always able to act at peak performance with this perk, it has no effect on true recovery time from injuries or mental trauma.,,
Cyborg Sympathiser,,1,,00,,False,,False,,This perk requires the Cyborg Sympathizer Origin. Take this perk to start your Jump in Cyberstan-occupied territory, instead of being stationed on a Helldrop Ship.%%%%Stratagems and the Reinforced perk aren’t going to be playing a role in your jump, unless you buy the relevant Federation materiel yourself. But on the bright side, you’ll have no Federation breathing down your neck and preventing you from developing and installing more and more obvious upgrades.,,
Cyborg Sympathiser - Free Thinker,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You are a contrarian at heart, and any absolute thinking imposed on you via outside forces will start coming up at the edges. Absolute thinking from within can also come into question, though.%%%%Prepare for a lifetime of philosophical waffling, traitor scum.,,
Cyborg Sympathiser - Crewman of Theseus,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,No matter how much you replace, you're still the same at the core. When modifying your physical form, your soul/humanity/selfness is no longer threatened or damaged.,,
Cyborg Sympathiser - Integrated Warfare,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have a non-psychic, technological ability to unify with any technology over a distance of no more than one mile, taking in sensory information from it directly as if the sensors were organs of your own.%%%%There is no connection between it and you to interrupt or detect, and while you cannot control anything you merge with using this perk alone, it is counted as "you" for purposes of Jumpchain purchases.,,
Cyborg Sympathiser - Autobutchery,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Conducting surgery on yourself is pretty easy! You're entirely comfortable with seeing your body disassembled, even if it still hurts. You also have a knack for grafting technology to your meaty bits (especially mechanical additions that'd be considered non-conventional) and having fine control of all technology your flesh touches- so long as you have a way to plug it into your system.%%%%Sentient technology has a chance to resist this.,,
Cyborg Sympathiser - Post-Humanist,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Wherever you go, discontent with the tyranny of the natural form spreads.%%%%Those exposed to you or your communications will start harboring thoughts of becoming something more than they are. With prolonged exposure they become more radicalized, more willing to sacrifice parts of themselves to comply with this new urge (the manner of which this is accomplished depends on the jump setting). The more extreme go on to try and proliferate the means with which other adherents can "ascend". Some violent extremists may even force indoctrination and subsequent ascension on others.%%%%Individuals that have already attained what they personally consider an ascension (be it biological, spiritual, or technological in nature) are immune to this perk.,,
Illuminate Collaborator - Slippery Diplomacy,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,The Squ’ith are not especially well known for their diplomacy, but they are creatures of reason, and their reason can be dangerously contagious. When initially encountering forces that are hostile to you for non-personal reasons, be it anything from because of a hatred for all living things to warring with your species to them just happening to be hungry for your flesh, you have an opportunity to temporarily align yourself with them, given common cause. Better make it obvious and fast, though.,,
Illuminate Collaborator - Pursuit of Knowledge,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Spending time with the Squ’ith has planted the same fire in the pit of your stomach they have, that urge to understand.%%%%Your passion to learn and acquire knowledge has become insatiable, and your ability to pursue that passion has been increased dramatically. For purposes of education, you are much more attentive and able to think quickly and rationally. Non-academic experiences and situations that you can mentally frame as learning opportunities also benefit from this perk.,,
Illuminate Collaborator - Knowledge is Power,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,With demonstrated competence, your influence gradually grows, even in hierarchies your circumstances would ordinarily completely lock you out of.%%%%If you have taken the Illuminate Collaborator Origin, this perk allows you to advance through the ranks of the Squ’ith as if you were a member of their species, operating as a Hunter until you’re Apprenticed by an Illusionist, and eventually take the mantle of an Illusionist yourself.%%%%Who knows, you may even ascend to the rank of Council Member, and be let in on the locations of the Squ’ith Weapons of Mass Destruction.,,
Illuminate Collaborator - Agile Hierarchy,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Squ’ith leaders aren’t content to sit on the sidelines while their allies' lives are in danger, and that seems to be the case with you in most situations you find yourself in.%%%%In dangerous situations, your leadership takes a personal role in the effort to overcome it and provide for your protection.,,
Illuminate Collaborator - NanoTech-nician,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You can now operate NanoTech on the skill level of Illusionists, who are among greatest warriors and scholars of the Squ’ith.%%%%On Squ’ith occupied territories you can at any time draw up a ball of NanoTech from the atmosphere around you and lob it as a homing projectile that detonates to either stun, severely harm, or disorient your foes.%%%%Your understanding of Squ’ith NanoTech allows you to synthesize and replicate and strengthen your own clouds of NanoTech, given time.%%%%This perk also grants you a personal cloud of NanoTech to use outside of Squ’ith occupied territory, but it requires 30 seconds after detonation of your last projectile to regroup with you and recharge.%%%%Your rate of fire for NanoTech abilities decreases dramatically with the strength of your NanoTech cloud.,,
Bug - Feral,,1,,00,,True,,True,,This perk requires the Bug Origin.%%%%Select any single Bug from the Tank or Elite class, it is now your Bug alt-form. This will allow you to communicate with other Bugs, and not get eaten alive by your supposed allies.,,
Bug - Burrower,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You are at home underground, and can easily and silently pass through it with minimal effort so long as it is actually diggable, leaving no trace of your entrance or exit. This is especially useful with tactical relocations.,,
Bug - Venomous,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You can now spray a jet of acidic poison from your mouth that partway paralyzes your victim, and pheremonally signals to your allies that they should destroy them.,,
Bug - Broodlord,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You call, and they answer. By silently letting off a plume of spores through your skin, you can summon a swarm of angry Bugs from the ground beneath you.%%%%The responding Bugs will be of all classes, and while they won’t target you, you will not be able to control them.%%%%This ability can only be used once per day.,,
Bug - Progeny,,1,,-8000,,True,,True,,This perk requires the Feral perk. This perk allows you to avoid Jumpchain failure on death.%%%%You are spreading, Jumper. Your spore clouds carry more of you, the surfaces you touch are infested with YOU. You’re a burgeoning Hivemind, Jumper, and your bodies sprout and hide and infest wherever you go.%%%%These will most often be lower forms, but some will be combat forms, and a select few will even be the Tank/Elite species that you picked for Feral. As these bodies reach maturity, they’ll become extensions of you, as ready to be commanded as your left hand. Or claw, rather.%%%%Your mind can travel freely between these various bodies.%%%%Should your current form expire while you’ve got progeny hanging around, your mind simply transfers to one of your other bodies.,,
M2016 'Constitution',,2,,00,,True,,True,,This rifle is handed to every Federation citizen when they reach 16 years old, to encourage service. It is, on closer inspection, identical in every way to a M1906 Springfield 30 06. While the technology behind it is dated, it's still an incredible threat to the unwary, especially with the optional bayonet attached.%%%%A permanent copy of it can be given away every day.,,
Pick of the Armoury,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,This item can be taken multiple times.%%%%You may take a single fiat-backed primary weapon or heavy weapon from the selection available to Helldivers.%%%%If you take this item at least once, you may also take your choice of the four sidearms: the PLAS-3 Singe, FLAM-24 Pyro, P6 Gunslinger, or the classic P2 Peacemaker.%%%%Your selection of weapons can be found here: https://helldivers.gamepedia.com/Weapons,,
Stratagem Radio,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free for Helldiver%%%%With a second or two of preparation, you can throw a beacon that will communicate one of four prepared messages through it's massive visual beam shooting up into the sky. While it was originally intended for communication with a Helldiver Dropship, it is also able to relay information to anyone in visual range.%%%%Be warned though, while only allies will understand it, EVERYONE can see it.,,
Sharp Uniform,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Free for Drop In%%%%You look like you belong. When wearing this, it takes on the appearance of the uniform standard of underlings wherever you are, and so long as you look like you're on task your supposed superiors will rarely think twice of you.,,
Mysterious Briefcase,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A mysterious briefcase appears somewhere in the galaxy, especially marked. In subsequent jumps it will take on the form of a setting appropriate McGuffin and be hidden somewhere in the world.%%%%Upon retrieving it and turning it in to your superiors, you'll receive great riches and status.%%%%The briefcase will not appear until you are sworn to a native faction, and will disappear until the next jump if you become unaligned again before it can be retrieved.%%%%If you pay an additional 50 CP for the Briefcase, it will never disappear once it appears.,,
Eagle Fighter,,2,,-1500,,True,,True,,A multi-role aerospace craft used by the Super Earth armed forces, often deployed under Helldiver Command to perform atmospheric operations. It is capable of aerospace superiority fighter operations, as well as performing precision ground attack operations in support of Helldiver surface missions. The Eagle's can be equipped with a variety of direct fire cannons, guided missiles, or various guided bombs. You can choose to have the functionality of the Eagle Fighter imported to any single “fighter craft” in your possession instead of receiving one.,,
Infantry Fighting Vehicle,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Discount for Cybord Sympathiser%%%%A powerful war machine used by the Cyborgs, this comes equipped with heavy armor, a massive main gun, and a rear compartment from which five twisted Grotesques can emerge, respawning a minute after the last Grotesque has been killed. You can choose to have the functionality of the Infantry Fighting Vehicle imported to any single “tank” in your possession instead of receiving one.,,
Cloaking Field,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Discount for Illuminate Collaborator%%%%Active combat camouflage technology straight from the Squ’ith. With this tech you become nearly invisible.%%%%Just try and avoid using any weapons that glow.,,
Helldrop Ship,,2,,-7000,,True,,True,,A faster than light capable ship responsible for dropping in Helldivers, and delivering stratagems from orbit to wherever they got requested from on the surface down below.%%%%Comes equipped with amenities and utilities for up to six living people, robust trans-atmospheric shuttles, an inexhaustible supply of inactive and suspended clones equipped for short range mind-upload, computer systems sufficient to mount and coordinate a war effort, and a devastating Helldiver armory that can weather seemingly endless lost kits.%%%%This item links to your warehouse via portal.%%%%If you pay an additional 400 CP this item lets you receive the benefits of the Reinforced perk regardless of Origin. You can choose to have the functionality of the Helldrop Ship imported to any single “space ship” in your possession instead of receiving one.,,Second tier
Commemorative Cape,,2,,-500,,True,,True,,The garment of a true hero, out of jump wearing this will mark you as a veteran of distinction.%%%%It also looks really cool with its constant heroic billowing, even in the absence of sufficient wind or atmosphere to be doing so.,,
Import,,3,,-500,,False,,False,,Pay 50 CP per companion imported to this Jump, who start with 500 CP each. This can be taken up to eight times.,,
Helldiver,,3,,-1500,,False,,True,,This companion starts with the Helldiver Origin for free.%%%%A fellow member of the Helldivers to take on your journeys and help you spread managed democracy. These companions will benefit from the Reinforced perk in any Jump regardless of if you purchase a Helldrop Ship or not.%%%%Helldiver companions start with 600 CP.,,
Butcher,,3,,-1500,,False,,True,,This companion starts with the Cyborg Sympathizer Origin for free. It cannot take a second Origin.%%%%The surgeons responsible for a decent chunk of Cyborg rebel “upgrades”, wrapped heavily in hinged-on flesh. They are more than capable surgeons and fabricators of technology, just don’t expect the end result to be pretty.%%%%Butcher companions start with 600 CP.,,
Illusionist,,3,,-1500,,False,,True,,This companion starts with the Illuminate Collaborator Origin.%%%%Prime examples of what you can achieve with sufficient thirst for knowledge and capability, Illusionists are powerful, well-shielded companions that can throw out offensive and supporting NanoTech abilities.%%%%Illusionist companions start with 200 CP.,,
Tank,,3,,-1500,,False,,True,,This companion starts with the Bug Origin. It cannot take a second Origin.%%%%It’s rare to tame one of these creatures without being a Bug yourself. This massive beast can flatten anyone that gets in the way of its mighty charge, and if it slams the ground, everyone nearby will be knocked off their feet. Be sure to mind that large, obvious weakspot on its tail.%%%%Tank companions start with 200 CP.,,
Drawbacks,,3,,00,,False,,False,,You may take up to 600 CP in drawbacks for extra CP to spend on perks and items. Companions may take up to 300 CP in drawbacks.,,
Super Earth's Finest,,3,,500,,False,,False,,You allies for the missions to come will be of incredibly variable skill levels, and you’ll be as likely to run into fresh recruits as you are into grizzled veterans- even on heavily infested fronts that’d chew up the former like Liberty flavored gum.,,
Super Earth's Finest - "Special" Forces,,3,,500,,False,,False,,Your allies are especially liable to make silly decisions or to unnecessarily make things harder on themselves, even when they are highly skilled. Expect to see plenty of orbital nuclear strikes called down seconds before emergency evac, soldiers using their jump pack just to see if they can land on top of a Warlord, and close friends trying to complete a mission using only their sidearm and smoke grenades.,,
Signal Corps Volunteer,,3,,500,,False,,False,,This drawback requires the Helldiver Origin, or the Helldrop Ship item and Stratagem Radio.%%%%Good news! When you call down a stratagem, you no longer need to throw a beacon to call it down, and the delivery time is even a little faster. Bad news! You are the beacon.%%%%Calling down equipment, materiel, and especially air support is now a bit more dangerous with it being centered to drop on your head- better get used to diving for cover after anyone in your team requests an ammo drop.,,
Valuable Carapace,,3,,500,,False,,False,,For some reason or another, your enemies especially want you dead to harvest parts of your body. Expect the mere sight of you to excite them and get them to concentrate their fire on you.,,
How About a Nice Cup of Liber-Tea!,,3,,500,,False,,False,,You spout off cheesy one-liners and patriotic barks through all speech as well as during acts of violence. These quips CAN count as "For Super Earth" cries, if delivered with intent. Your library of cheesy one-liners can be found here:%%https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o8abon9s6e6y3ed/AADMCAHS6n3D4MmUGmskd6Qua?dl=0,,
"Affirmative.",,3,,1000,,False,,False,,This drawback requires the Helldiver Origin. Dropschool really did a number on you, huh?%%%%Apart from the pre-programmed propaganda of How About a Nice Cup of Liber-Tea! (if you’ve taken that Drawback), you are only able to say "Affirmative", "Negative", "Move" and "Wait".,,
Merciful,,3,,1000,,False,,False,,You have difficulty bringing yourself to harm someone that’s been laid low, even if it would be the right strategic call.%%%%For example, on pushing back the Federation from a crucial urban planet, you can’t bring yourself to use planet-destroying WMDs to prevent them from recapturing it. Enemies you’ve downed you can’t finish off, even though you know they won’t stop trying to kill you.,,
Underfunded PR Team,,3,,1000,,False,,False,,Don’t hold your breath for liberation parades in your honor. You’re reviled, be it because you look scary, the population doesn’t support your cause or methods, or just enemy propaganda that was more potent than your own.,,
Life is Cheap,,3,,1000,,False,,False,,Your life, that is. It seems like no matter the precautions you take or the perk interactions you benefit from, you’re only two or so mistakes away from being turned into a greasy spot on the ground. Armor barely helps your survivability, and even being part of a well-disciplined team will have difficulty guaranteeing your safety.,,
Liber-Coffee,,3,,1500,,False,,False,,The weapons you bring and the manner of air-support available to you are randomly selected from your faction’s armory for every situation you'd want to be armed in.%%%%Overrides Take the Helm in matters of what gear to prepare.,,
Fireteam,,3,,1500,,False,,False,,Lower your active companion cap to 3 for the duration of this Jump. This includes Imports, companions purchased on this Jump, AND any companions you recruit during this jump using recruitment perks.,,
Tracked,,3,,2000,,False,,False,,This drawback requires the Helldrop Ship item, OR the Helldiver, Navy Specialist Officer, or Private Origins.%%%%Select one of Man's enemies (Cyborgs, Bugs, or Illuminate, or the Federation if you are associated with any other faction). They can now appear on any mission you deploy to, and potentially board your ship if you remain in one place too long.%%%%If you lose control of the bridge of your ship, the chain fails.,,
Suspected Cyborg Sympathizer,,3,,2000,,False,,False,,This drawback can only be taken with the Helldiver, Navy Specialist Officer, or Private Origins, it cannot be taken with the Defector perk. You are watched closely by your peers and superiors. Mistakes in the field or complaints about the management of the Federation will draw a great deal of ire and could even lead to your imprisonment if you aren't silver tongued enough to work around a militarized court. This suspicion can ebb and flow with observed behavior, but it'll always be lingering around you.,,
Super Earth Has Fallen!,,3,,5000,,False,,False,,This drawback cannot be taken with the Bug Origin. The Federation’s fleet is scattered across the galaxy, and Super Earth is no more.%%%%Jumper must re-establish humanity's homeworld by Jump's end, or the chain fails.,,
