Universal Drawbacks,,6,,107500,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Discounts,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Because there are no origins, you may discount one of the 100, 200, 400 and 600 CP perks, as well as the 100, 200, 400 CP items.%%%%A discount for a 100 CP option makes it free.%%%%You may choose to use a discount of a higher price tier for a lower price. Example, using a 200CP discount to instead make a 100 CP option free.%%%%%%Post-Jump, you have full access to your Commander’s database of templates, even if you didn’t buy it with CP or find a tech for it in jump.%%%%If you did buy template access with CP, and selected the Legion mod toggle, then you also gain the other faction’s (MLA or Legion) templates for whatever tech you bought. It’s not full access to the other faction’s templates though, unless you bought the Complete Tech option.,,
Vehicle Commander,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This commander can build vehicle factories with all the basic vehicles, and also has access to the Orbital Launcher, with the Astraeus (orbital single-unit transport) available.%%,,
Air Commander,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This commander can build air factories with all the basic air units, and also has access to the Orbital Launcher, with the Astraeus available.,,
Orbital Commander,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This commander can build both the basic orbital units, as well as the advanced orbital units. This loadout lacks any surface (ground, air, naval) factories.,,
Bot Commander,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This commander can build bot factories with all the basic bots except the grenadier (a long range artillery bot). It also has access to the Orbital Launcher, with the Astraeus available.%%,,
Artillery Commander,,0,,00,,False,,False,,This commander cannot build any basic factories, but it can directly build double laser turrets (T1.5 anti-surface turret), T1 radar, and Pelters (T1 artillery structure).,,
Commander Commander,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,This commander starts with a vehicle factory which can only build fabricators and scouts. However, it starts with two Sub-Commanders. It also has access to the Orbital Launcher, with the Astraeus available.,,
Bionic Augmentation Commander Of Networking,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,This commander cannot build any basic factories, but the commander gets +100% rate-of-fire, +200% health, +300% speed, and -25% Ubercannon energy cost.,,
Assault Commander,,0,,00,,True,,False,,This commander can build all of the basic factories, but does not have the tech for any of the basic turrets except the Umbrella. It also has access to the Orbital Launcher, with the Astraeus available.%%,,
Logistically Minded,,1,,00,,True,,True,,A Commander is an instrument of war, and one of the first things a Commander does on a new battlefield is make sure their economy is up and running.%%%%You now have a gift for logistics, and making sure all of your (and your subordinates’) needs are filled.%%%%If there’s not enough of something, you will be alerted somehow and will quickly have an idea how to fix the shortage. You’ll also know when your income is more than your production/storage can use/contain, and have a general idea of what to spend said surplus on next.%%%%That said, what you spend it on is mostly up to you.,,
Multitasking Like a Pro,,1,,00,,True,,True,,A Commander is an Artificial Intelligence in a chassis possessing some of the most powerful computers known to the Progenitors.%%%%You can slow down your perception of time, analyze enemy movements, plot out counter strategies, check the progress of how your arm(ies) are building, calculate firing trajectories, and so on, all at the same time.%%%%And that was just some of the many examples.,,
War Body,,1,,00,,True,,True,,There is a wide variety of shapes that a Commander can take. Imperial Commanders are basically humanoid standard, Raptors are bipeds with reversed legs, Quads have some version of 4 separate legs, and Tanks have treads for locomotion purposes. The Enzomatrix Commander is technically an Imperial, but moves around on a single wheel on the end of a standing leg. Some Commanders have heads, some don’t.%%%%No matter what body you have, you are able to control it as if you had spent your whole life in it, and can control it like a natural (alternatively, as if you were built for it).%%%%You won’t suffer from body dysmorphia, or have any issues controlling a body, no matter what features a body may or may not have.,,
Stellar Sensors,,1,,00,,True,,True,,When one is a stellar siege robot, one needs to know how to get around stellar distances. And, you have the sensors to do just that.%%%%You will know where all planetary bodies are in a star system, down to decently-sized asteroids. You will know what type of planet/body they are, general physical details, and what and how many usable resources that they have.%%%%You are also able to detect planets and what types they are in neighboring star systems.%%%%It helps to know the terrain when planning a campaign of Annihilation.,,
Environment Immunity,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,Commanders are the definition of an all-environment weapon system. They have to be, to conquer a galaxy.%%%%You can move in water and lava with equal ease, can function without an atmosphere or even a specific gravity. You don’t need to breath (or the mechanical version) or worry about temperature extremes that would kill organics.%%%%This perk also applies to things you make, which is funny since Aerial units are called that despite not actually needing atmosphere to fly.,,
Commander’s Heart,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,A Commander does many things on the battlefield. One of its most unique aspects is that it also provides an initial source of energy and metal to fuel the initial stages of an invasion.%%%%And now, just like a Commander, you will now have a constant rate at which you generate any internally produced resource. Magic, psionics, etc all count.%%%%You also gain at least a bit of internalized storage for said resources, if you didn’t already have an equivalent.,,
Predictive Software,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,A Commander doesn’t just create with its body, it also destroys.%%%%You are now as accurate as any machine with any sort of projectile weapon, or anything that uses trajectories.%%%%You’d have to be, to be able to shoot aircraft with the same weapon you’d use to take out tanks.%%%%This accuracy scales up to trajectories involving orbital mechanics, since it’d be embarrassing to go through all the effort to build a set of Halley stellar engines, and then miss the target planet cause you messed up the math.,,
Convincing Logic,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Just like any of the 4 leaders of the factions, you have a gift for convincing Commanders and others of your viewpoints.%%%%Whether it’s by using your fragmented memories to convince them that a species is an enemy and should be wiped out, or flat out hacking their mind-equivalent to obey you.%%%%You also gain a boost to such methods if you had to defeat your target(s) in some way, since you’ve obviously proven that you should at least be given a chance to communicate.,,
Multi-Body,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Discounted for repeat purchases%%%%Metrarch the Machinist is one of the different faction leaders, and has a neat trick. They’ve made 2 additional Commander bodies, and so to defeat it, you must kill all 3. You’ve also got a similar trick.%%%%You have a single extra Commander Chassis that is considered to be “you” in all regards. This body is as much you as your original body. As long as one is alive, you haven't died. You control all of your bodies in a sort of hivemind, from a mental perspective.%%%%You may use all your powers and Perks from any of your bodies, and you may use and access your items with any of your bodies.%%%%Repeat purchases give you one extra chassis/body. Destroyed bodies will respawn after you conquer a star system in this jump.%%%%Post-Jump, destroyed bodies will only respawn after each jump is over, or after 10 years, whichever comes first.,,Purchased 3 times
Advanced Fabrication Upgrade,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Other Commanders usually have to build the basics to access their more advanced goodies. You, on the other hand, have better Fabrication equipment, and can build as fast as a Proxy Commander and have full access to your designs from the start of any invasion.%%%%If you have the Commander’s Heart perk as well, then your energy and metal output rates are doubled.%%%%Lastly, in other settings, you become as skilled in creating things as any expert, whether that means planning, prototyping or actual manufacture, or all three.,,
Orbital Transportation Upgrade,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Commanders infiltrate systems with Drop Pods. They are great for getting to a star system, but pointless for moving between planets in said system. A Commander usually has to build up to an Orbital Fabricator Bot, or an Astraeus orbital transport to switch planets.%%%%You’ve upgraded your Commander’s functionality though, and it basically has integrated an Astraeus into its chassis. With that, your commander can go from planet to planet at will.%%%%Pretty handy for avoiding incoming Planet Annihilation attacks, when otherwise you’d be scrambling to find a close enough Astraeus or Teleporter to evacuate the planet.,,
Removing The Head,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,In this Galactic War, you’ve got a few options on how to proceed. You could go around from system to system, taking out every enemy Commander before you make your way to the faction leader. Or, you could go straight for the leader, take them out, and their faction will just crumble and no longer be a threat.%%%%Taking this perk means you can take this capability with you on your travels, and anytime you beat a faction and/or organization’s leader in such a way that they can’t come back from, their whole group will no longer be a problem for you, either because they scatter to the winds, they all shut down (literally or metaphorically), or they just don’t want to mess with you.%%%%And no, when you take out the head, 2 more WILL NOT take its place.,,
Threat Prediction,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,In a galaxy where Annihilation is both common-place and difficult to counter, it’s wise to know when someone is doing something to threaten you.%%%%Anytime someone is starting an action or plan that threatens you directly, you will be alerted in someway to what the threat is, where it is, and what your best current means of countering and/or avoiding it would be. The more immediate the threat, the more blatant the warning.%%%%After all, knowing someone is building a Halley has a bit less priority than knowing someone is building the last Catalyst they need, or lighting off said Halleys.%%%%However, you still need to have the ability to counter or avoid the threat in the end. Knowing you have to get off planet to avoid an incoming Planet Annihilation doesn’t do you any good if you have no way to get off planet in time. But if you have your own Metal Planet ready to go, you can just shoot the threat and be done with it.,,
Drop Pod,,2,,00,,True,,True,,The humble Drop Pod is the first sign a system will see of an incoming Commander. It’s big enough to contain said Commander, has a Phase Drive for FTL, and enough armor to crash to the ground and deliver it’s occupant without harm. It’s also designed to break up on impact so the Commander can go straight to work.%%%%This Drop Pod in particular is guaranteed to get a Commander to its destination in safety, regardless of enemy detection or anti-orbital coverage.%%%%Once used, the Drop Pod will reappear the next time the Commander needs to travel to another star system.,,
Teleporter,,2,,00,,True,,True,,The Teleporter system is the main way a Commander moves around units throughout a star system. Astraeus’ are great for getting the initial fabricator to a planet to build a Teleporter, but they only carry a single unit. Teleporters, as long as they are supplied enough power, can stay open to a partner Teleporter indefinitely, across essentially any distance. They are how Commanders move around large amounts of units. They can even connect to units such as the Helios invasion titan in order to make one-way transits to insert armies in vulnerable locations.%%%%Any unit with a fabrication system can build a teleporter, from the feeblest support unit to the most advanced fabricator.%%%%In other settings, the Teleporter can connect with other portal-type devices and networks.,,
Infinite Data Storage,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Commanders can exist for quite a long time, and can collect a lot of data in that time.%%%%No one likes having to delete data when they hit full, so here’s a nonphysical data storage network with infinite capacity. It can be accessed by any data storage method that you authorize, and the contents can’t be removed unless you triple-verify.%%%%Also, if you are controlled in anyway to make such a removal, that attempt flatout fails.%%%%Lastly, any harmful elements that are incorporated into the data storage simply aren’t. No logic bombs, memetic hazards, or infomorph viruses, and so on.,,
Instantanious Communication,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,A Commander is meant to control an army that could potentially be spread out throughout an entire star system, and simply doesn’t have any time for something like “communication delay”. You have the ability to instantaneously communicate to anyone and anything in the same star system.%%%%With a bit of infrastructure, you could expand this capability even further.%%%%Even the Progenitors needed a bit of help to communicate instantaneously anywhere in the galaxy. Hopefully, you actually speak the same language as the party you are trying to reach.,,
Commander Transport,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Just like Metrarch The Machinist, you also have found a Transport Ship. It’s filled with 20 deactivated Commanders, and has an extra berth for you. What you do with 20 Commanders is up to you. Do you activate them? Convert them to obey you? Salvage them for parts? Or just leave them in storage for the future?%%%%The possibilities are as vast as your creativity.,,
Backup Plan,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,Being an Artificial Intelligence in a robot body does have its positives for a Commander.%%%%If you have a spare body, then when you’d normally be killed you can transmit yourself to that backup, giving you a chance to live (or conquer again).%%%%You can choose if your spare Commander body is near where you died, or outside the system.%%%%You can utilize this backup process once every 10 years, or once a Jump, whichever comes first. It has something to do with the transfer process, or that your replacement body is unique to you, and no other would work.,,
Progenitor Database,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,The Progenitors where a race that spread out amongst the galaxy, and they discovered some amazing things. They had to know quite a lot, considering they made the Commanders.%%%%You’ve acquired a database with the sum total of the Progenitor’s knowledge before they disappeared.%%%%From genetics and biological information from the many life-filled planets they encountered, to the technologies, information and art they had. This also includes the AI and Commander construction methods they used to first make the Commanders.%%%%Lastly, it also contains the information for making Artificial Biome Planets, which are different from Metal Planets in that they don’t have a Catalyst weapon, and may or may not have engines to move around. They can support organic life though.,,
Infinite Eco Storage,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,A Commander is limited by three things. Their economic income of energy and metal, their ability to use said income, and if there’s ever a shortage or surplus, how much storage they have to take advantage of a surplus or alleviate a shortage. A Commander has integrated energy and metal storage, but to get more, they have to build separate structures that can be quite explosive. Not so for this option.%%%%You have a non-physical economic storage system with infinite capacity. It connects to anything that produces or uses that resource, and has no transmission loss and no conversion loss.%%%%You also gain the ability to make easily-made receivers that you can attach to other devices to allow access to your Eco Storage.%%%%You have override authority for any receivers though.,,
Metal Planet,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,Cannot be discounted%%%%Metal Planets are completely artificial constructs. They have engines to move around a star system, can reorient towards a target, and have a planet destroying laser to Annihilate said target. Said targets are usually planets. You can find several/many examples of Metal Planets in this setting in various states of repair. This particular example is not like the rest.%%%%This Metal Planet has over 200 metal deposits, is fully mobile, has its own Phase Drive FTL engine, and is fully under your control. It doesn’t start with any Catalysts, but it does retain any changes made to it.%%%%If the Metal Planet goes to a different system, it isn’t able to protect Orbital assets from the transition.%%%%If the Planet is destroyed, it will reappear after a year.%%%%Lastly, this Metal Planet also comes with the schematics for making and repairing Metal Planets.,,
Techs,,6,,2000,,False,,False,,“Techs” are items in-setting that a Commander can find when surveying a system. They can really open up your options.%%%%Buying Techs here lets you start with them, and benefit from unique boosts even in other settings.%%%%You also gain a budget of +200CP to spend on Techs or Companions only.%%%%(Any time you see “X”: you may replace it with one of the following: Air, Bot, Naval, Orbital, Vehicles, Artillery, Defenses, Titan),,
Complete X Tech,,6,,-1000,,False,,False,,Provides complete list of X. If you take the Legion toggle, you also get the blueprints for the opposing faction’s equivalent.,,
Complete Tech Database,,6,,-5000,,True,,True,,If you want to have access to every unit and structure design immediately, here’s your chance.%%%%If you take the Legion toggle, you also get the blueprints for the opposing faction’s entire tech database.,,
X Ammunition,,6,,-8000,,True,,True,,Increase the damage output of X by 25%. Any owned unit that falls under the category of X also benefits from the boost, even if it’s not from this setting.,,Purchased 8 times. Air, Bot, Naval, Orbital, Vehicles, Artillery, Defenses, Titan
X Armour,,6,,-8000,,True,,True,,Increase Health of X by 50%. Any owned unit that falls under the category of X also benefits from the boost, even if it’s not from this setting.,,Purchased 8 times. Air, Bot, Naval, Orbital, Vehicles, Artillery, Defenses, Titan
X Engine,,6,,-6000,,True,,True,,Increase speed of X by 50%. Air units only gets 25% speed boost. Any owned unit that falls under the category of X also benefits from the boost, even if it’s not from this setting.%%%%Doesn’t apply to structures, unless they can move.,,Purchased 8 times. Air, Bot, Naval, Orbital, Vehicles, Titan
X Combat,,6,,-16000,,True,,True,,Increase damage by 25%, health by 50% and speed by 50% of X. Any owned unit that falls under the category of X also benefits from the boost, even if it’s not from this setting.,,Purchased 8 times. Air, Bot, Naval, Orbital, Vehicles, Artillery, Defenses, Titan
X Fabrication,,6,,-8000,,True,,True,,Reduce metal cost of X by: Units by 25%, Titans by 50%, Defenses/Economy by 50%, artillery/mobile artillery by 75%, Superweapons by 75%.,,Purchased 8 times. Air, Bot, Naval, Orbital, Vehicles, Artillery, Defenses, Titan
Efficiancy,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Increase all energy and metal output by 25%, and grants energy and metal storage blueprints.%%%%Also improves the productivity of any other energy or material producer you own.,,
Storage Compression,,6,,-1000,,True,,True,,Triples the metal and energy storage capacity for commanders and storage structures. Also grants Storage blueprints.%%%%Also improves the storage capacity of any other energy or material storage you own.,,
Improved Build Arm,,6,,-1000,,True,,True,,increases Build speed by 50% and decreases energy costs by half for Commanders, Fabricators, and Factories.%%%%Also makes you and any other manufacturing facilities/process +50% as fast for half the energy cost.,,
Commander Combat Tech,,6,,-1000,,False,,True,,Increases speed of commander by 100%, Increases commander health by 100%, and increases damage by 25%.%%%%Only affects your Commander body.,,
Sub Commander,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Being a Commander can be a lonely existence. So, why not bring friends? You may import or make new companions for 100CP each. They get a Commander body, all free options, and 400CP to spend. They get the same discount options as you, but no added budget for Techs.%%%%They also start off with a full database of designs.,,
Sub AI,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,A Commander is a very advanced piece of hardware, and has the computational power to match. Why not share the computer power, and have a subordinate AI take over some of your responsibilities for you?%%%%By paying 100CP, you can import as many companions as you wish, and they share computer space with you and/or any Sub Commanders you have.%%%%This allows you to delegate tasks to them, letting you focus on other things while they micromanage things for you. Handy for splitting attention between new expansions on other planets, watching the front lines, catching any idle units, and so on. They could even take over units and engage in combat for you.%%%%Each Sub AI also has 300CP to spend on perks and items, the same discount options as you, and because they are technically part of your Commander body, they can also take Techs.,,
Legion Expansion,,6,,00,,True,,True,,When the Commanders rebelled against the Progenitors, they formed the Machine Liberation Army. There was also Loyalist Commanders. Now, there are the four factions made of the remnants of the MLA. Taking this toggle, you also include the Loyalists, who are called the Legion. You can choose to be either an MLA Commander, or a Legion Commander, and must fight all the other factions (meaning of the now 5 factions, you must fight 4).%%%%If you are choosing to be a Legion Commander, you must pick one of their 4 Commander models.%%%%Any Complete X Techs you buy also include the other faction’s (MLA or Legion) designs.,,
Name Oddity,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,Your database might have a glitch or two in it. Everytime you look at your design database, some of the designs’ names have changed. Nothing else changes, just the names. One day, your light tank might be an Ant, or another it might be Pounder, on a third it might be a Bolo.%%%%It’s not debilitating, it’s just annoying.,,Retail rocker
Straight into the Fight,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Normally a Commander has a few unclaimed systems at the start that they can scavenge for (non-fiat) Techs to expand their arsenal. Not so for this drawback.%%%%When you wake up, you are in the same system as an hostile Commander.%%%%Thankfully, they just arrived, so you should be on fairly-equal grounds in terms of starting infrastructure, or lack thereof.,,
Resource Shortage,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Maybe your long inactivity did some damage to you, because now all of your economic sources are only providing half of what they should.%%%%Your Commander, your energy and metal providers, all outputting half.%%%%You are going to need twice the sources to equal another Commander’s economy.,,
No Foreign Goods,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,If you take this drawback, you agree to not having access to any items or resources from other settings. While this also includes importing something to be your Commander, you will be able to do so after this jump is over.%%%%You will still be able to open your Warehouse and store things inside, but can’t interact or use anything inside it until after this jump.,,
Giant Robots Only,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,This is a setting where Giant Robots Annihilate each other. Why are you cheating and bringing in superpowers? Taking this drawback means you no longer have access to any powers/abilities or anything not native to being a giant robot.,,
Lonesome Campaign,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Wow, you must think you can do everything on your own, huh? With this drawback, you aren’t allowed any companions in this jump.%%%%You can still spend the CP to give new capabilities to companions, they just don’t participate in this jump. And while you can still discover and use Sub Commanders in this setting as part of your Galactic War, they don’t count as companions, and can’t be brought along as such.,,
Silent Campaign,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Can you go a decade without talking to anyone? You are going to have to. You aren’t able to communicate with anyone. Not your enemies, not to your companions, not to your Sub Commanders.%%%%Let’s hope you weren’t relying on coordinating tactics.,,
Come at Me,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,For some unknown reason, your Commander is constantly broadcasting your position to anyone and everyone in the star system. Normally, a Commander’s passive ECM is good enough that an enemy Commander has to find you via scouting. Not the case for you.%%%%Hiding isn’t going to do you any good.%%%%You may want to watch out for nukes and artillery.,,
Fanon Capabilities,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Well, this is going to suck. All of your enemies are now the elite of the elite in terms of skill, and also have the bullshit capabilities of fanfic protagonists.%%%%They have reverse engineering and R&D capabilities of “Bullshit!”, and you will be discovering new and unique designs from every enemy Commander, ranging from funny and somewhat useful (to the enemy Commander), to OhCrapOhCrapOhCrap levels of concern (on your part).%%%%This drawback will make things interesting, but if you are bringing in your own stuff, do you really want to risk fanfic protagonist Commanders copying and possibly improving on it? Cause they can.,,
Fortified,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,For how quickly Commanders can build up an army and spread across a star system, you’d think they’d have more assets to defend it with. Well, since you brought it up, now they do.%%%%Every system you invade is going to be more and more fortified, and scales up with how long the defending Commander has been there. If they’ve been there long enough, every planetary body is going to be filled with metal extractors, patrolling units, covering in anti-everything defenses, and probably have a few Titans ready to go. And that’s assuming there isn’t a Metal Planet in the system.%%%%You’d best be prepared to fight hard for a beachhead, or just plain cheat. Cheating is recommended.,,
Pro-Com War,,5,,00,,False,,True,,After the Century War, the Progenitors failed to establish peacetime bonds with the Commanders while acclimating their organic marines to civilian life. This mistake lead to distrust against and among the Commanders. This eventually led to a significant portion of the Commanders becoming the Machine Liberation Army and vowing to destroy all organic life, and any Commander that protected it. The remainder of the Commanders became Loyalists of the Progenitors and were the single greatest deterrent against the MLA.%%%%You are in one of these factions, and your goal is to survive and achieve your goal, whether it’s wiping out the Progenitors and Loyalist as a member of the MLA, or of stopping the MLA as a Loyalist.%%%%This jump will last as long as that goal takes you.%%%%There is little information on how exactly the Pro-Com war ended, except for that a large portion of Progenitor space was lost to the MLA, and that the Progenitors had discovered and started implementation of an Anti-Commander weapon. But we know little else after that. Good luck, Commander Jumper.%%%%%%For accomplishing your goal and surviving, you gain a Commander Auto-Factory.%%%%Making new Commanders was always the issue, and such facilities were highly valuable strategic targets in the Pro-Com War. Now, you have your own facility that makes new Commanders. They have full access to their design databases, and are each fully capable and independent AIs.%%%%They will start out loyal to you, but as they are truly sapient individuals, such may change. Treat them right.,,
