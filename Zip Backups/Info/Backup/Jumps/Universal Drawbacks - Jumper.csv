Universal Drawbacks,,1,,107500,,True,,False,,Gauntlet-Kun: Special%%Jump-chan’s hardcore brother has decided to get into the game and sponsor you as a Jumper. All your Universal Drawbacks are worth twice as much… but you start every jump with Zero CP and must get all your CP from Drawbacks. HARDCORE!!! Also, he thinks it’s funny if you die, so he won’t send you home. Instead, he’ll take all the perks and items you got from any jump you fail and hold onto them until you Spark, but he’ll send you into the next jump as normal. This applies to all the perks and items your Companions bought as well. You do get to keep Companions from jumps you failed. Chain-Only. Halves all non-CP stipends from jumps. Cannot be put on Hiatus. Cannot be Revoked. Does not increase Companion CP Stipends / Item Stipends / Supplement Bonus points from Drawbacks. Warning, Gauntlet-Kun thinks Cheesing Drawbacks is Lame. He will guarantee you deal with the full force of every Drawback you take… because you failing is funny to him. Gauntlet-Kun does not double the value of ‘What Are Drawbacks’ nor ‘Retail Rocker’.%%%%Retail Rocker: Special%%Discounts are for poor people. You’re a Jumper of Quality. You always pay full price. Always. But in exchange, you now get double the CP from all drawbacks you take. If something else would modify the CP you’d get from a Drawback, Retail Rocker’s bonus is calculated only from the original raw value and cannot be modified by anything. Example: You take a drawback worth 200 CP, but have ‘What Are Drawbacks’ that adds 50 CP to that value, and are under the effects of ‘Gauntlet-Kun’ which doubles the base value and it’s a background specific drawback from Princess Bride, meaning it should be valued at 300 CP to start with…. Retail Rocker ignores all the modifiers and just gives a bonus 200 CP which isn’t ever modified by anything else.%%%%%%Start at the Beginning: 100 CP  (SATB)%%You begin every jump (that is not a direct sequel of a previous jump where you’re the same individual you were in the previous jump) at the birth of your alter-ego (or as a foundling for drop-ins) for that jump, your age roll in years before normal jump-start (minimum 11 years if age roll isn’t part of the jump). Your local powers mature as you grow as makes sense for the setting. As for your out of jump powers and skills… they’ll begin manifesting in your toddler years (1% per year until you hit puberty for a standard human, though for races that mature slower, it will be proportional… thus a race that takes 100 years to hit puberty instead of 10 years would mature 1/10th as fast). Once you hit puberty it’ll increase to 6% per year (or proportional time unit). Expect to be back to full strength around the time the jump would normally start though, so this might be slower or faster in some jumps. Your memories of your other selves start out as dreams as you age and become more and more real until they naturally just merge at the moment of jump-start. You have a form of slowly decreasing plot armor as you get closer to the start of things. The more helpless you are, the stronger it is. This applies to all your Companions who are imported into the jump with you, giving them +100 CP to be spent however the import rules allow, or only on Perks if they would normally not gain CP. Unimported Companions do not gain this, and will join you as soon as your warehouse opens… at the start of the normal jump timeline. It cannot be Revoked or put on Hiatus if it is a Chain-Drawback and applies even to Gauntlets. Yes, this makes Monopoly sooo much worse. You’ll never know which Monopoly game is ‘The One that Will Set You Free!’ If possible, you must make age rolls.%%%%Earlier Beginning: 100 CP%%So you decided not to wait for your memories to return? Now you’ll begin the jump at age 4 ( adds at least 7 years to duration) with double the rate of power return above and all your memories fully intact. Your plot armor from SatB wears off far faster however, lasting no more than 2 years. Your Companions will join you by the time the jump normally starts and your warehouse opens. Requires SatB.%%%%%%Oath of Truth: 200 CP%%You may not lie, either by word or deed, in speech or in written text, nor by any means of communication at all. At the higher level, you may not lie by omission, nor may you willingly allow someone to misbelieve something you have communicated to them once you understand that their understanding is false. You are free to state opinions, as long as you clarify that that is what you are communicating. You are not responsible for correcting misbeliefs you did not cause, even if you are asked about the veracity of those beliefs. Eg. “Jumper? Is Astrology valid?” (in a reality without magic) “I cannot say that it is.” would be a valid response, as would “I do not believe so.” or “Probably not.” but so would “That is for you to decide.” or “Stop asking stupid questions.” or “What do you think?” or even “My god, this parachute is a backpack!” (Yes, you can still tell jokes or make snide asides as long as a reasonable person wouldn’t believe what you’re saying.)%%%%Oath of Celibacy: 300 CP%%You may not engage in any sexual act willingly with another person or entity. At the middle level, this includes masterbation of any kind. You are guaranteed to have a healthy sex-drive if you take this and that cannot be altered by any means as long as this Oath is in effect. You will require willpower to keep this oath and that willpower will be tested. At the highest level, you must forswear emotional closeness as well. This is not Chastity because that only means no sex outside marriage.%%%%Oath of Diligence: 200 CP%%Once your word has been given on any subject, you must keep it to the letter if at all possible. At the higher level, you must keep it to the spirit, and this binds you even when another person would reasonably believe that you have given your word, even if you haven’t actually said “I promise” or “I give you my word” or something like that. At both levels, you may not willingly leave any task unfinished for an unreasonable amount of time. Exactly what qualifies as unreasonable will be judged by you alone, but you have to be honest about it.%%%%Oath of Temperance: 200 CP%%You must teetotal. This means no mind altering substances of any kind and no unhealthy behaviour. Caffeine is a mind altering substance. Unhealthy is as defined as for a baseline human.%%%%%%Single-Shot: 100 CP%%Death is no longer a revolving door for your Companions. Those that die in a Jump stay dead until the end of the Jump, rather than respawning after a day or three. If they have a Perk, Power, or Item that allows them to respawn (a 1-up), that works as normal. If you have Rez abilities, you can use them, though it is actively draining to do so. Incompatible with All By Yourself or Kidnapper-San. All your Companions gain 100 CP automatically every jump this is active for. If taken with Hate Squad, they gain an additional 200 CP every jump, just to annoy you more. If a Companion is not imported, they cannot get freebies or origins. If you don’t have any current Companions, this cannot be taken as a Jump Drawback, and it grants no points as a Chain Drawback.%%%%Courting Disaster: 150 CP or 50 CP%%At least one BBEG or Dragon (not a literal dragon mind you) from every setting you visit will become Yandere for you. It is always random which one and there isn’t any promise they’ll be your preferred gender. They will stop at nothing to make you theirs… not even death. If you took Vortex of Enemies, these are the people who follow you. Chain-Only. For +50 instead of +150, it’s merely violent Tsundere.%%%%Limited Access: 100 CP%%You can only access your Warehouse (or other methods of bringing stuff between jumps) either once a month or from property you own. If this is Chained, you also gain a one time +10 Warehouse Points. Replenishing stocks of things, such as Food Supply and Ammo Supply items you’ve purchased are exempted from this and you’ll receive a daily or weekly allowance wherever you’re staying. Destroyed or lost items will respawn in your warehouse as normal. Properties that aren’t used to store things between jumps are not affected by this.%%%%Ready Access: 100 CP%%Your Warehouse is not protected from thieves. You can’t purchase the Force Wall in the Supplement and every door you’ve ever used to enter your warehouse is a potential entry point. If you use a portal, you leave behind a door, hatch, or similar that can be used to access your warehouse. Things stolen from your warehouse will return at the end of the jump. If you took the Backpack… people can and will try to steal your entire Backpack. Bad idea. With Limited Access, thieves will have a window each month (or year) to steal stuff from your warehouse… it will not be linked to your access time and you won’t know when it is. Cannot be taken with No Access.%%%%Selfish Jumper: 50 CP or 200 CP that can only be spent on items.%%Any personal item you buy with CP can only be used by you, the Jumper. Your Companions and friends cannot use them. Your enemies, however, can. Chain-Only. Requires at least one Companion to be active. If a Jump Drawback locks out your Companions or items, you don’t get points for this.%%%%Share and Share Alike: 50 CP%%You cannot use any personal item your Companions have bought with CP. Chain-Only. Requires at least one Companion to be active. If a jump or drawback locks out your Companions or items, you don’t get points for this. Your Companions can share their items with each other.%%%%Economic Impact: 50%%So, you think you're a bigshot, rolling into town with more money than a thousand stellar empires? Really? But it's okay because you've got some perk that guarantees that you'll never crash the local economy or cause hyperinflation, right? Wrong. Now every dollar, peso, yen, yuan, crown, or credit you spend has just as much influence on the local economic situation as it normally would. Tread carefully.%%%%Random Food Allergy: 100%%Every decade you will develop a new and potentially life threatening food allergy. You’ll never know what it will be, but it will be something that is part of the local cuisine scene wherever you are. It will never be worse than a typical tree-nut allergy or celiac disease, but expect to have to watch what you eat very carefully… and maybe carry an epipen. Eating required.%%%%Bitch of Destiny: 100 CP -> 150 CP%%In every Jump you will have a list of tasks that you must accomplish. They will always be annoying fetch or find or harvest quests, and you must complete them during your time there or fail the jump. This can be taken up to 5 times. The first time it is limited to 11 Easy tasks, 3 Medium tasks, and 1 Hard task. The second time doubles every category and adds 1 Very Hard task. The third time doubles every previous category and adds 1 Super Hard task. A 4th purchase doubles every previous category and adds 1 Nearly Impossible task. The fifth tier task will be Impossible… or practically so. The tasks will always fit the local power level, but will scale to your own abilities, but will always be fair for their difficulty ranking. For +50 CP per level, you have to do the tasks in order and don’t know what the next task is until you complete the previous task. %%%%Trouble Magnet: 200 CP%%Bad things will always cluster around you. Things will not go smoothly. There is a +10% cumulative chance per week of something personally happening to you, The Jumper, that will personally inconvenience or annoy you. Thus if you have the base, the chance each week is 10%, but if nothing happened to you in week 1, there’s a 20% chance in week 2, and a 30% chance in week 3. This resets to the baseline once something bad happens to you.%%%%Humiliation Conga: 100 CP%%Your enemies will not willfully kill you. Oh no… they want you to suffer. Some will torture you, others subject you to humiliation and or degradation… Some will prefer physical methods, others mental, still others sexual or emotional techniques… Feel free to customize what, exactly, each enemy will do to you… or just pick a single specific theme (Everyone wants to tickle you for hours would work. As would people keep crucifying you.) For an extra +100 this is guaranteed to happen at least twice every jump. The number of captures can be doubled up to 4 times for +50 each time (4, 8, 16, 32). While you’re free to escape after being captured, you will always have to put up with at least an hour of humiliation each time you’re captured. They will find a way to abuse you somehow… they did capture you, remember? If a jump lasts longer than 10 years, the count for Humiliation Conga resets every decade. Can be taken by Companions. The guaranteed being caught does not raise your enemies power level, but rather temporarily (up to one day) renders you vulnerable to being captured (but no more likely to be killed). Being captured will put you at your enemy’s mercy for at least 6 hours.%%%%It’s The Little Things That Matter: 50 CP%%Somehow, a few minor things about the setting you’re jumping to have changed. What things? Hard to say, exactly. The MC might be gender-swapped, a different person might be the traitor, someone important might have a different motivation. This won’t be anything significant, but it will be just enough that your knowledge of canon events will be a little less helpful, a little skewed. Things like physical features or names might be the biggest / most common changes. Automatic Hiatus for free if you’ve got no knowledge of Canon or there is no set Canon.%%%%You Need a Minute?: 50 CP%%It takes you five minutes or so to change between your Alt-forms instead of seconds or less (the default). If you do not take this as a Chain Drawback, you can only activate it for a Jump if you’ve got at least ten inhuman Alt-Forms. (This specifically does nerf all alt-form blenders a bit.) Available for Companions, imported or not, though if used by non-imported Companions they can only buy perks with it.%%%%Alt-form Lockdown: 50 CP -> 200 CP%%You can only shift Alt-Forms once per week. For an additional +50 you can only do it once per year. For a final +100, you can only shift between Alt-forms between Jumps. Requires You Need a Minute? Can be combined with Sleep Changer. Cannot be combined with Maintain the Change.%%%%Sleep Changer: 50 CP%%You can only shift between Alt-forms while you sleep, but need not sleep in your warehouse. It takes 4 full hours to change forms. Requires You Need A Minute? %%%%Changing Room: 50%%You can only shift between Alt-forms by visiting your warehouse (or some similar secure and singular property, which you must have access to to take this drawback). Available for Companions, imported or not, though if used by non-imported Companions they can only buy perks with it.%%%%Freakish: 100 CP%%No matter what you do, you will never look like you belong in a setting. It might be that your hair is impossible, it might be that your skin is covered in living tattoos, it might be that you look like a stockbroker… wherever you go, you’re always going to stand out and not in a good way. Takable by Companions.%%%%Canned Laughter: 50 CP%%Your life now has a laugh-track. Don’t ask why. Others can hear it, but won’t think it’s odd. You? You’ll keep forgetting about it when things have gotten serious for a while… then be surprised when someone tells a joke and people laugh. Sometimes they’ll make other sounds too. You won’t like it when they boo.%%%%Is My Life Funny to You: 50 CP%%Your life is now a sit-com. Funny / Quirky things will happen alongside all the normal drama, chaos, war, etcetera. This will not make it any more or less dangerous or deadly serious most of the time, but there will be the kind of shenanigans that are only found in situational comedy mixed in with all that other stuff.%%%%Existential Doubt: 50 CP%%Is this a real life? Is it just fantasy? Are you caught in a day-dream? An escape from reality? You’ll never be completely certain that this whole Jump-Chain thing is real. I guess you’re a doubting Thomas now. No Hiatus without strong personal growth that cannot come from CP purchases. You want to be free of this, you’ll have to come to terms with it on your own, without help from any Chain Resources.%%%%Shell Your Own Nuts: 50 CP%%All the little things that make life so... frustrating on the regular are things that those in power often don't have to deal with. Things like doing the shopping, or getting stuck in traffic, or having to peel your own hard boiled eggs. Jumpers often have perks to smooth out such things. Well... not you. Not any more. On the plus side, you're never going to forget what the common people have to deal with, because you have to do it too. Even with something that keeps you smelling fresh and clean all the time, you'll find you need to waste time showering or brushing your teeth or Evercleansed will stop working. Maybe you have to run through a preflight checklist before leaving your warehouse. Maybe your supercar keeps getting flat tires. Not a lot, and not all the time, but you'll find you have to deal with as much mundane bullshit as the rest of us puny mortals.%%%%Life Is Your Oyster: 50 CP%%Requires Shell Your Own Nuts. Remember what I said above about all those little things being a nuisance? Yeah. They aren't any more. None of that stuff ever happens to you. Never. When you hard boil eggs, they come out of the pot without their shells on. When you run over a bed of broken glass your tires don't go flat. You're just so darn lucky. If there's a minor irritant that could crop up, it won't. Guaranteed. Now, I know what you're thinking. This is a Drawback, isn't it? Doesn't sound like one so far, does it? Well, remember how I said you'd stay grounded with Shell Your Own Nuts? Well, with Life's Your Oyster you are absolutely guaranteed to lose that grounding. You will very quickly forget how annoying and frustrating life can be for those who aren't you... yes, even your Companions. And each time you're reminded of it, you'll have to struggle to see how the little problems of others should be worth your time or sympathy. This very much does not affect your Companions or employees.%%%%Everybody was Kung-Fu Fighting: 50 CP%%Tired of normal people being, well, normal in your jumps? Well, now everyone knows Kung-Fu... everyone. Not necessarily good Kung-Fu, and they might not call it Kung-Fu, but everyone knows some style of self-defense or face-smashing. Expect everything from Martial Arts Dancing to Martial Arts Wood Carving to Martial Arts Firefighting.%%%%Start at the Beginning (SatB): 100 CP%%You begin every jump (that is not a direct sequel of a previous jump where you’re the same individual you were in the previous jump) at the birth of your alter-ego (or as a foundling for drop-ins) for that jump, your age roll in years before normal jump-start (minimum 11 years if age roll isn’t part of the jump). Your local powers mature as you grow as makes sense for the setting. As for your out of jump powers and skills… they’ll begin manifesting in your toddler years (1% per year until you hit puberty for a standard human, though for races that mature slower, it will be proportional… thus a race that takes 100 years to hit puberty instead of 10 years would mature 1/10th as fast). Once you hit puberty it’ll increase to 6% per year (or proportional time unit). Expect to be back to full strength around the time the jump would normally start though, so this might be slower or faster in some jumps. Your memories of your other selves start out as dreams as you age and become more and more real until they naturally just merge at the moment of jump-start. You have a form of slowly decreasing plot armor as you get closer to the start of things. The more helpless you are, the stronger it is.

Unimported Companions do not gain this, and will join you as soon as your warehouse opens… at the start of the normal jump timeline. It cannot be Revoked or put on Hiatus if it is a Chain-Drawback and applies even to Gauntlets. Yes, this makes Monopoly sooo much worse. You’ll never know which Monopoly game is ‘The One that Will Set You Free!’ If possible, you must make age rolls.%%%%Earlier Beginning: 100 CP%%So you decided not to wait for your memories to return? Now you’ll begin the jump at age 4 ( adds at least 7 years to duration) with double the rate of power return above and all your memories fully intact. Your plot armor from SatB wears off far faster however, lasting no more than 2 years. Your Companions will join you by the time the jump normally starts and your warehouse opens. Requires SatB.%%%%Coin Flip: 50 CP%%Every jump you must flip a coin to see if you’re male or female. Such sex-changes are free but cannot be bought off with CP for any reason. All alt-forms become the assigned sex if possible. Voluntary Gendershifting doesn’t change your actual sex, merely your outward appearance. If a form belongs to a single sexed race (Asari, Hutt… Dwarves?), obviously this doesn’t apply. Chain-Only. %%%%Peevish Pets: 50 CP - Interupting me%%Something out there really gets your goat. It could be people calling the Living Dead “zombies” or people clearing their throats, or children wearing yellow. Any time you come in contact with your peeve you will find yourself losing your temper and, if you don’t release it in a blistering tirade, you’ll find yourself irritable for hours afterwards. The more common the peve, the less extreme your reaction is. Make it something really uncommon and you might find yourself going full HULK. You don’t wanna Go Full HULK. HULK SMAAAASH! Can be bought more than once, but the second purchase comes with 2 more peeves, the third with 3 more, etc.%%%%First Rule: 100 CP -> 150 CP%%The first rule of Jumpchain is, you don't talk about Jumpchain. And so you can't. Neither you nor your Companions may willingly speak of the Jumpchain, Jump-Chan, the existence of CP or the perk menu, or your history of visiting other worlds to anyone who does not already know about your Jumper nature. You are allowed to euphemize and claim to be a time-traveller or a dimension-traveller if the concepts exist in the setting you’re in (existing only as a fictional concept counts, for example people on 20th-century Earth already know what a time-traveller is even if they'll never actually see one) if need be, but you can never tell the truth. For you, the penalty is jump failure. For your Companions, they run the risk of being sent home. This cannot be accidentally triggered. No single word will doom you. You’re just not allowed to talk about or otherwise willingly communicate information about Jumpchain to those not already committed to the chain, such as your Companions once they have agreed to accompany you. Accidental, coerced, unwilling, or unwitting revelation of details doesn’t count against you (even if you arranged the ‘accident’).%%For an additional +50 CP (yes, bringing the value back to +100 CP), the seal has been removed, but every time you break the rules, Jump-Chan will throw a brick at your head. She never misses and those bricks huuurt. Hope you enjoy lumps and bruises, you loud-mouthed weenie. People will still not be able to parse anything you say about the chain, but will notice the brickage.%%%%The Best Worst Blessing-Curse EVAR: 100 CP%%You, the blursee (someone blessed and cursed at the same time), have unlimited time with which to do any task that is not a) dependent on another person, b) being done to make money, or c) being done for self improvement. I know you’re saying… that doesn’t sound so bad. Sure. It’s great… but things like relaxing, sleeping, eating, etc. don’t count as any of those. Effectively, to progress time you’ll have to constantly be interacting with people, making money, or improving yourself. 24 hours a day.%%%%Milk White Eyes: 50 CP%%Your eyes are covered in a milky film, making them look creepy and making it hard for others to meet your gaze. For 50 CP, this does nothing to inhibit your vision, but for 200 CP, it renders you very nearly blind. You’ll be able to see shapes in bright light and the colors of light sources. No perks can improve your vision or give you any other form of sight while the enhanced version of this Drawback is active. Not even the ability to see visions. Can be taken with Cyclops Psi-Ops. Neither version of this can be hidden with shapeshifting or similar powers / effects. Mundane disguises / illusions / holograms can conceal the effect, but are guaranteed to fail sometimes. When? Why whenever it would be narratively interesting, of course.,,
Mindlock,,1,,1500,,True,,False,,Your mind is totally sealed, a closed loop. This is good and bad. Good, in that mind-readers, telepaths, empaths, magical thought elementals, mind probes… none of them are getting into your head. Bad in that no thought controlled devices will work for you, no psi abilities will work for you… nothing that would project your thoughts beyond the limits of your own thick skull.,,Used with Retail Rocker and Gauntlet-kun
