Starting CP,,0,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Villager,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are no-one special. You washed up on the shore of the island of Motonui one day, and the villagers accepted you as one of them. You have no memories of this world. Or, alternatively, you were born in the village of Motonui and have a family and friends in this world.%%%%You may be any age from 4 to 64 and any gender you like.,,
Not a Princess,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are someone special, born of a heritage and lineage respected and admired. You are of the blood of chiefs and wayfinders. You have been raised from childhood to put the needs of others be- fore your own, and are brave and true, unflagging in your devotion to your people.%%%%You may be any age from 4 to 64 and any gender you like.,,
Demigod,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Just as Maui was made the demi-god of wind and wave by the Gods, you too were born a human, but abandoned by your parents and raised by the gods. You are stronger and tougher than any mere mortal, but as long as you are in this world, you must have the symbol of your power in your hands to use your more fantastic powers. As a Demigod, you are immortal and ageless and are probably several hundred years old.%%%%Feel free to choose your gender.%%%%You must take the individual drawback “Without Your Fishhook You are Nothing” for no points to keep your immortality and agelessness past this jump.,,
Living Legend,,0,,00,,False,,False,,From the tiny Kakamora to the mighty Tamatoa to the titanic Te Ka, there are many living legends in this world... and now you are one of them. You might be the Storm Spirit, or The Wind, or something more concrete like a giant monstrous whale, but whatever your form, you are a timeless being, no more affected by the passage of time than the ocean is.,,
Haka,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You know how to express yourself in a simple powerful way, a way that shows your defiance and presents an unmistakable challenge across all language barriers. The haka is a way to proclaim your strength and prowess before battle, to welcome distinguished guests with honor, or to commemorate the passing of a worthy individual. When you use the Haka to level a challenge at another, it cannot be ignored, and (if you're powerful enough) even the elements themselves must pay you heed.,,
DISNEY!,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,100 CP to keep%%%%You can sing! I mean really belt it out. Not only can you sing, but when you sing, other people will often join you, sometimes even dancing, even if they can't normally do either, and do it well. They will even know the words. If there isn't any music, someone will probably start playing an instrument, improvised or otherwise. Your ability to spontaneously break into original songs that relate to what is going on is practically Disney-esque.,,
Tattoocraft,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You become a master of tattooing in the traditional Polynesian fashion, and can apply those tattoos far faster and with less pain and swelling that is entirely natural. You instinctively understand the meaning of all tattoos you see from now on. By an act of will, you can alter existing tattoos, either to improve bad ones or repair damaged ones.,,
Nowhere You Can Go That I Will Not Be With You,,3,,00,,False,,False,,The strength of the individual lies in the strength of the community. Surely you have some friends you?d like to bring along. For 100 CP you can import any and all companions you might have as villagers, giving them 400 CP each, though they cannot take drawbacks. This cannot be used to create new companions. Alternatively, for 200 CP you can import a single companion (or create a new one) as a Living Legend, Not Princess, or Demigod, giving them 600 CP. they can take up to 600 more CP of Individual Drawbacks. For 200 CP you can also recruit any canon Not Princess, Living Legend, or Demigod, but they don?t get CP to spend. If your old companions aren?t enough, for 100 CP, you can create or recruit up to 3 new villager companions, canon or other- wise. Demigods, Not Princess, and Villagers created this way will be loyal to you as long as you don?t mistreat them. Living Legends will act according to their nature and may or may not be loyal to you.,,
Villager - Where You’re Meant to be,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The villagers of Motonui know who they are and where they belong. Now, you do too. You possess the ability to find and share contentment anywhere. Wherever you go, you will find that you belong there, as long as it is at all hospitable.,,
Villager - Consider the Coconut,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You know all the skills of a tribal villager. From making baskets to fishing, to farming, to swimming, to danc- ing. You know how to build huts and how to cook traditional Polynesian foods. Not only are you exceptionally good at all of these tasks, you excel at teaching them to others. However, your true gift lies in finding utility in all things, making sure there is as little waste as possible. Consider the Coconut, whose husk, flesh, milk, shell, wood, and leaves all serve different purposes.,,
Villager - Village Crazy Lady,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Once you know what you like, well there you are. Sure, you might be a bit strange, but that can have many ad- vantages. No one ever questions why you do what you do, or anything out of the ordinary about you. You can go where you want and, as long as you?re not damaging anything, no one will stop you. Secrets just have a way of falling into your hands. You always seem to find yourself in places where something interesting is happening... and you know who you are at all times and nothing can ever make you forget it.,,
Villager - Spirit Animal,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have a large tattoo of some natural animal on your back, and have a special bond with those animals. They tend to flock around, and will listen to your requests as long as you don?t abuse this connection. Once, per jump, when / if you would normally die, you may come back, transformed into the form of your chosen animal tattoo. Your form is a particularly grand and large version of that ani- mal, and becomes an alt-form from then on. Each jump, you may change your tattoo to something appropriate. You can be all glowy if you like.,,
Not a Princess - Born to the Chiefs,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have a long and proud heritage, one stretching back beyond all historical records. Because of this, know how to hold yourself and how to put others before yourself, and you can call up visions of the spirits of your ancestors to see what they might have done in similar circumstances or to inspire others or yourself. Every common-born individual will treat you with respect. You carry this with you, no matter where you go.,,
Not a Princess - We Know Where We Are,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You are a Wayfinder, you know where you?re going because you know where you?ve been. As long as you know where you are and how you got there, you will be able to find your way back to wherever you came from. As long as you know where you are, and something about where you are going, you will be able to chart a course there eventually, though there may be trials and setbacks along the way. You could even cross the pacific ocean without any instrumentation or landmarks and instinctively understand how to navigate anywhere you might end up.,,
Not a Princess - A Sky Full of Stars,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,There is wonder out there in the darkness, a universe as yet uncharted. No place will ever be truly dark for you, not outside, not inside, not inside your own heart. Even in the darkest places, it will be as if everything is lit by bright star- light, and even in the darkest of times, you will never lose hope (for more than a few minutes). As long as you can see the sky, or even a sliver of it, you will never grow bored and will always find some new aspect of the universe to find fascinating.%%%%You can name every star in the sky (there are about 10,000 visible with the naked eye), and since you can do that, you can instantly tell any two (or more) objects that look virtually identical apart as long as there is the slightest difference. Oh, and you have a perfect visual memory, remembering every aspect of anything you?ve ever seen to the smallest perceptible degree.,,
Not a Princess - Chosen,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,One of the forces of nature has chosen you and will answer your call, as long as you are in a place it can reach. The ocean will protect you from drowning and part at your request. The storm will ravage and rage where you ask. The wind will blow as you ask. The sun will blaze or temper its brilliance at your whim. As you grow more confident, as long as you are respectful, the range and power of what you can command will likewise increase, though you?ll only ever have pull with your chosen force. Furthermore, thanks to your chosen status, your will is indomitable, as you have come to learn that there is little you cannot accom- plish if you put your mind to it.,,
Demigod - You’re Welcome,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You are a Master of Arrogance. Insults and slights slide off you without impact and your self-worth is nearly impervious to the imprecations of others. Any praise at all serves to revitalize you as if it were rich food and drink.,,
Demigod - Hero of Men (and Women),,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your feats are legendary and your reputation precedes you. No matter where you go, people will have heard of you and your more astonishing achievements. They will respect and or fear you as seems appropriate. The better your reputation, the more they will be awed and impressed by you. The worse, the more they will be terrified and cowed by you. It is possible to have more than one different reputation, depending on if people are your enemies or allies or just people.,,
Demigod - Cher-hooo,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Would you look at that? You can shapeshift into any natural animal you?ve ever seen. And you can do so incredibly rapidly. It takes less than 1 second for you to shift from a tiny bug to a giant whale. You can even transform in mid-flight and back, or partly shapeshift at will. This is powered by your confidence and sense of self-worth. Anything you?re wearing shifts with you, but not things you?re carrying.,,
Demigod - Ordinary Demi-Guy,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have the strength of twenty grown men and the toughness to survive a thousand foot fall without damage. Non-lethal wounds heal within minutes and you have enough endurance to stay awake and active for weeks on end. You can survive indefinitely without food or water, and while you won?t be happy, you won?t be suffering or hampered by the lack. What?s more, you can perform what otherwise would be impossible feats, such as dragging islands up from the bottom of the ocean, or lassoing the sun, or growing coconut trees by planting electric eels.,,
Living Legend - Monstrous Nature,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Mandatory%%%%Not all Living Legends are nice. Some... many... most perhaps, are monstrous in nature. Some are simply so inhuman as to be hard to define by any mortal terms. Certainly, the concept of morality or ethics has little hold on them, and that?s very much the case with you. Each Living Legend has a particular nature, a set of rules and strictures that apply specifically to them and only them. They are not good, or bad, and nothing any mortal code might have to say about it can make it otherwise. If you?re a Living Legend, for the duration of this jump, you must act in accordance with your nature, and acting against that will cause you great emotional discomfort. Your nature is determined by who and what you are. If you are like Tamatoa, a greedy treasure collecting crab, you will find yourself acting like it. If you?re a storm spirit, you will find yourself lashing out, often at random.%%%%After this jump, however, you can simply invoke this so that any system of morality or ethics slides off you harmlessly. You are not good or evil, you are just you.,,
Living Legend - Shell of Gold,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,As a Living Legend, you may take a form that fits your legend. It can be anything that might exist in this world. You could be a giant volcanic island, or a super-sized monstrous version of some natural creature (Tamatoa is a Coconut Crab the size of a large house), or you could be a living elemental, like the Ocean or a living storm front. Regardless, you are timeless and all but immortal... but also instantly recognizable in your true form as being who and what you are. Even someone who has never met you will know who you are. Your name will be whispered across the various cultures you encounter, even before you meet any of their people.,,
Living Legend - Force of Nature,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,As you pass through the world, you leave bits of yourself behind, smaller parts of your whole. These could be seeds of thousands of plants that swirl through the air behind you, or an aura of smoke and ash, or swirls and whirls of mist. These minor elemental fragments serve to fulfil your elemental nature, each in their own way. A life elemental?s fragments would seek out desolation and restore it. A fire elemental?s fragments would burn and devour.%%%%These fragments shed naturally when you are in your elemental form and normally don?t have much of a life of their own. But by sacrificing some of yourself, be it blood or hair or something similar, you can bring them to life for a short time. The more you give, the longer they will last, and if you sacrifice some part of yourself that is important to you (a hand, a finger, an eye) you could potentially bring that fragment to permanent life.,,
Living Legend - A Greater Gift,,1,,-10000,,False,,True,,Perhaps you are a being of the storm, or of volcanic fire, or of life itself. Perhaps you are the Ocean in all its vastness and wonder.%%%%You may spread whatever you are far and wide by an act of will, though the further you do this, the more you will lose yourself in the act. However, if you focus on a specific place and time, there is little you cannot do. You could transform a volcanic wasteland into a verdant paradise in minutes as a spirit of life, or burn such a paradise to ash and dust as a spirit of fire. When you act in this guise, you utilize what you are. The Ocean uses water to influence things. Te Ka uses fire and smoke. Te Fiti uses plants and life itself.%%%%The only limits on this are the limits of nature itself, and even then, such limits are fragile things, often little more than suggestions. Even at your most spread out, you will be able to sense things happening at your extremities the same way someone would feel a bug crawling on their foot. You must be something that is part of the natural hu- man world. You could be the sun, or moon, but they?d be a geocentric model?s versions of celestial bodies. This is a pre-science culture. No taking things like gravity or nuclear fission. Death would be a ravening beast, just as life is a massive verdant island. What you are not is also as important as what you are. Time might be a bird whose wings brush away a little bit of the world as it passes, but while it could age things, it couldn?t flow backwards or stop time, as that would go against its nature.%%%%While you are hard to damage in any real way while diffuse, when you are in a single place, you are more vulnerable and can still be destroyed with sufficient force or power.,,
Pet Pig or Chicken,,2,,00,,False,,True,,You can have as many as you like. The chicken is a bit dim and the pig is scrawny and small, but they?re very loyal. Do not try to eat them. They have unnatural longevity, never growing older. Put down the knife. No eating the pets. Not even as emergency rations.,,
Fair Winds and Clear Skies,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Yu can?t quite control the weather, but whenever you absolutely need the sky to be mostly clear and the winds to be strong but not%%too strong, you can make a wish for that to happen and, unless some force is actively trying to shape the weather differently, it will be that way. This takes a few hours to%%work, so best make your wish early.,,
Sundrops,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The mystical healing flowers of Tangled grow here in the south pacific, and if you take this option, you get a small garden patch of them. They can cure any sickness or injury if dissolved into a tea, and if a special prayer is said, they can reverse aging.,,
Villager - Necklace of Ancestors,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This ancient pendant necklace has a small compartment inside the pendant that can contain an item of power so that no force can detect it. It will never be searched by anyone as long as you wear it.,,
Villager - Lagoon,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A lush salt-water lagoon is added to your warehouse, full of all manner of sea life. It is surrounded by a forbidding reef that can- not be sailed beyond. There will always be fish in the lagoon, as well as crabs, oysters, and sea turtles. You?ll also get a small beach if you don?t also have Island Paradise.,,
Villager - Island Paradise,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A tropical island paradise, lush and vibrant with life, just like Motonui, complete with a village and villagers, follows you from jump to jump now. If you also have the Lagoon, the island will be surrounded by a reef and lagoon overflowing with fish and sea life. If you have the Cave of Answers, it can be found inside the central mountain of this island. You may choose to add this island to your warehouse rather than having it appear in other jumps, or incorporate it into any property you already own.%%%%Everyone on the island, visitor or resident, gains the benefit of the DISNEY! Perk while there.,,
Not a Princess - Conch Shells,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have an unlimited supply of conch shells, puka shells, and all other shells of common sea creatures. These are often used as currency or trade goods. The shells can either come empty or (if Te Fiti has been restored) with their original inhabitants, most of which are quite yummy.,,
Not a Princess - Canoes of All Sizes,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,You gain a large fleet of maori-style canoes, from single person outriggers all the way up to grand catamarans suitable for an entire family. All are suitable for deep ocean usage. Each ship?s sail tells the tale of those who have sailed upon her.,,
Not a Princess - Cave of Answers,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,This is a large cave with a waterfall at one end and a large platform with a maori wooden drum on it. If you go into the Cave of Answers and bang the drum within, the history of the world you are in will play out across the face of the waterfall. As history is vast, having a specific question about the past will cause the cave to focus on that period. For some reason, it particularly likes showing things in song format. If you have the Canoes, they can be stored in the cave, where they will never decay.,,
Demigod - Magic Fishhook,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have a large magical weapon of primitive but exquisite design. It was crafted by the gods of this world and given to you. It is all but indestructible, save by a god, and even then it can be used to damage even the toughest creatures without being damaged in turn. Up to twice per jump it can be used to deflect any attack, no matter how powerful, but the first time damages it and the second time destroys it. It must be restored by a god, though it will be restored afresh at the beginning of each jump by Jump-chan. You may import any previous weapon into this. If you are a Demigod, you must be holding this item to use any of your more overt powers, at least until this jump ends. %%%%No one else can use your „Fishhook? as anything other than a weapon. If you shapeshift with this item in your hand, it will become a marking on your body until you shift back.,,
Demigod - Living Tattoo,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your body is decorated in a living tapestry of tattoos that represent all your accomplishments and achievements. It even has a mini-you that lives among the other tattoos and with whom you can interact. This mini-you can count as a companion, but never takes a companion slot, because they can?t leave your skin. Your mini-you has tattoo versions of all your powers and you can make all your tattoos that aren?t alive vanish at will after this jump. You can import other tattoos into this.,,
Demigod - Island Prison,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,You gain a small rocky island from which no being that is imprisoned upon it by you can escape under their own power. It will follow you from jump to jump and you will always know where it is. It can hold one prisoner in each setting and those prisoners don?t come with it. Normal mortals might be able to es- cape, but the more powerful the prisoner, the harder it will be for them to do so. You have to actually seal them inside the cave on the island yourself.,,
Living Legend - Entrance to Lalotai,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,No matter where you go in your travels, you will always be able to find an entrance to Lalotai, the realm of monsters. Why you might want to go there is anyone?s guess, but it is said that (since it lies at the bottom of all oceans) the treasures of countless cultures lie there... and there are mysteries to explore down there, and monsters to fight, so there is that.,,
Living Legend - Kokamora Fleetship,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,What?s more fun that a thousand coconut pirates armed with blow-darts and spears on a massive ship that turns into more ships? Why, a thou- sand coconut pirates armed with blow darts and spears on a massive ship that turns into more ships that obey your orders and can be summoned out of the fog at your slightest whim! The entire fleet counts as a single companion and there are always more of them.%%%%They might be a bit hilariously inept at times, but they are dangerous and quite inventive. Look what they did with just wood and coconuts. They will stick around and be annoying / amusing until banished again.,,
Living Legend - Heart of Te Fiti,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Once the jump ends, you will gain your own version of the Heart of Te Fiti. It is a powerful magical item and cannot be destroyed or copied. While worn, it gives health and vigor to anyone in proximity to it. It can sustain life long past the time it should have passed and makes plants grow stronger and lusher. While it is part of you, you will cure all corruption and bring forth lushness and verdant plant growth wherever you go. If you give it away (and you can do so once per jump) it will confer extreme longevity and a small fraction of all your powers to whoever you give it to.%%%%Only your chosen one and their descendants will be able to use it. Any life magic focused through the Heart will be greatly increased in power and reach. If you give it away, you get it back at the beginning of each new jump.,,
Hair in the Face,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You will constantly find that you?re getting your hair in your face. All the damned time. Somehow, it will never dawn on you to cut your hair, and all efforts to restrain it will be only temporarily effective.,,
You can’t Fix it,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Things keep breaking around you and for whatever reason, you?ll never be able to repair them yourself as you?ve lost all technical and magical skills that might help.,,
A Glitch in Time,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Somehow things have gotten confused and instead of this being the story of Moana taking Maui to return the Heart, it?s now the story of Lilo taking Stitch on the same voyage. And you have to make sure they succeed without obviously helping them, or using any out of jump powers or technology to get them across the sea from Kaua?i to Tahiti (yes, Te Fiti is Tahiti). Remember, Stitch (like Maui) can?t swim and Lilo is six years old. The time is still around 1000 years in the past and no, you can?t get alien technology to help either.,,
Get Smoten,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,The Gods find you deeply irritating and keep trying to squish you. They?re not actively vindictive or anything, so they?ll just send the forces of nature or monsters to harass and hound you from one end of the world to the other. Expect a challenge.,,
Smoke and Ashes,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,It hasn?t been 1000 years since Maui stole Te Fiti?s Heart... it?s been 2000, and all life on the planet has been smothered by ash and smoke. The world is a desolate place where what few things manage to cling to life are monsters and horrors. The Ocean is a sea of muck and storms ravage what is left. Somewhere in this world is Maui, still imprisoned, but long since gone mad as the world crumbled around him. You must find Maui and convince him to help you find the Heart (and only through his help will you be able to do so) and then you must confront a far more powerful Te Ka and return the heart to where it belongs. Only in doing so can you restore this world to what it once was. All the world is much like Lalotai or worse.,,
Villager - No One Goes Beyond the Reef,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are unable to leave go beyond the reef that surrounds the island of Motonui for any reason.,,
Villager - Everything is By Design,,4,,-2000,,False,,False,,Things go as they have always gone, and that is fine by you. If you take this, you will be unable to make any impact on the flow of events... and must live an entire lifetime (at least 60 years) in this world.,,
Villager - No Fish,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,As a Villager, you?re used to listening to the orders of the chief, and not particularly used to acting on your own initiative. For the duration of this jump, you will have to have someone else make every important decision for you and you lack the drive to make any major changes or take and significant action without orders.,,
Not a Princess - It Calls Me,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You have a deep and abiding Obsession with the sea. It calls to you deep in your soul. Any day you spend entirely on land you?ll feel a little hollow, and it will grow worse each day you do not spend the majority of your time on the open sea.,,
Not a Princess - Idiot Rooster,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You are really dumb. As in sometimes you eat rocks or wander off into danger that you are oblivious to dumb. You also occasionally freak out for no reason.,,
Not a Princess - We Were Voyagers,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,You have lost something, but you have forgotten who you are. All your memories of past lives and jump-chain itself have faded into faintly remembered dreams. As the years pass, you will become convinced that you must cross the ocean and find... something... somewhere... that will restore what you have forgotten. It is unwise to take this with „No One Goes Beyond the Reef? as this voyage will mean that you must instead descend into Lalotai (the realm of monsters) to recover what was lost. A path to Lalotai will appear hidden somewhere on Motonui, but it will be hard to find and the trek across the realm of monsters will be arduous indeed.,,
Demigod - Can Do Anything but Float,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You cannot swim. If you enter the water, you will sink to the bottom. Oh dear.,,
Demigod - No One’s Hero,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,There was a time when people respected you, revered you, maybe even worshipped you. That is no longer the case. Sometime in the past you did something unforgivable and now all faces have turned against you. Only by somehow setting things right once more, an act which will put everything you are to the test and at risk, can you win back the trust and admiration of the rest of the world.,,
Demigod - Without Your Hook, You are Nothing,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Mandatory for Demigods, for no points, if you want to keep the demigod?s ageless immortality. If you don?t want it, you don?t have to have this drawback. You have a specific item in this world that you must hold in order to use any of your most overt powers. That?s anything like magic, psychic powers, super powers... everything that is not subtle. You can still be incredibly strong and tough and charismatic and heal fast... but only into the level of Maui?s demonstrated strength without his hook (He?s strong enough to lift a camakau -- an outrigger canoe -- with one hand).,,
Living Legend - YUGE EGO,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Big Monster, bigger ego. How anyone puts up with you is anyone?s guess. Not only are you extremely conceited, but you?re obnoxious and unsympathetic too.,,
Living Legend - Always a Bigger Monster,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,It is a truism of this world that there is always a bigger monster, and for you that?s doubly true. First off, you?re not even close to the top of the monster pecking order, being only about the size of Maui or a little bigger, but wherever you go, bigger monsters keep showing up and trying to eat you or steal your stuff.,,
Living Legend - Life in a Coconut Shell,,4,,00,,False,,False,,For the duration of this jump, you are stuck inside a coconut shell. A normal sized coconut shell. Your body will feel all cramped and squished and you will have great difficulty interacting with the world outside the coconut, which does have a few holes in it for you to see out of and to maybe push an arm or leg, if they?re small enough.,,
