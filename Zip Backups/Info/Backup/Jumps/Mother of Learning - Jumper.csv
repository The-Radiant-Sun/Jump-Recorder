Universal Drawbacks,,6,,107500,,True,,False,,Taking Universal Drawbacks,,
Body Mod - Greater Essence Infusion - Body Mod Effect,,6,,-1000,,True,,False,,Send 100 CP to the body mod,,
Student,,0,,00,,True,,False,,You are a student at the Cyoria's Magical Academy. Feel free to pick your year.,,
Hier,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are the heir of a noble house, with everything that entails. You can pick and choose your family history and how many relatives you have.,,
Teacher,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are a teacher at Cyoria's Magical Academy.,,
Independent,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You are an independent agent. Perhaps you are a famed adventurer, or some poor sap Zach included into the Time-Loop before Zorian.,,
Mana Manipulation,,1,,-12000,,True,,True,,First purhcase free%%%%Allows your soul to generate and to manipulate Mana. You start with a Mana Magnitude of 10, which is a little below average for a Mage. Each subsequent purchase increases your Magnitude by 2. There is no limit to how high your Mana Magnitude can be, but keep in mind that the more Mana you have, the more difficult it is to control.,,Purchased 24 additional times - Mana Magnitude of 124
In The Know,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Lets you in the Time-Loop, granting a Marker that 'loops' you back to the beginning after each iteration, allowing you to keep your memories and any alterations done to your Soul. Physical alterations are reset after each iteration. Each tier grants a different Marker. You get a Faulty Marker for free, like Zorian's, which may or may not trigger some security features of the Seraphic Gate, but definitely allows you 'in' the Time-Loop. Tread carefully.%%%%For 200 CP, it grants you a full marker, but comes with the same restrictions as Zach's, preventing you from directly altering your own Soul, and 'resetting' the world whenever your Soul is altered beyond a certain threshold. [Can be gained for free if you take Agent of the Divine or Slave To Your Flesh]%%%%For 600 CP, it grants you a Master Marker, without restrictions, and Primacy over the Seraphic Gate along with a built-in 'manual' for all the internal functions of the Marker, such as the 'Key-Finder' function. This allows you to 'trigger' the world reset at will, and the world only resets when *you* trigger it, either by dying or living past through the entire iteration. After the Time-Loop is concluded, the marker 'loses' most of its functions, but retains the ability to act as a '1-up', sending you a month back in time should you meet an untimely demise. This can only trigger once every 10 years until Spark, after which you may trigger it freely, even without dying.,,
Soul Conciousness,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are aware of your own soul, and are able to examine and manipulate it to a lesser extent, essentially the beginning stages of Soul Sight. You will require further training to do more than look at yourself with only this perk. This also grants you the ability to retain consciousness and rationality while disembodied.,,
You are a Soul,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,This perk guarantees continuity of identity, consciousness and self, regardless of what you do to yourself. Teleport by dematerializing your body, transmitting it, and then recomposing it? You are still you, and will always remain so.,,
Unique Bloodline,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,First purchase free for Heirs%%%%Your bloodline is blessed, or cursed, with an ability mirrored from a magical creature; An Aranea's affinity for Mind Magic, for instance, a Soul Chrysanthemum's affinity for Soul Magic or simply an Elemental's affinity for Evocation and specific elemental spells. Or it could be an outright power, such as a Shapeshifer's ability to transform into an animal. This affords you immense latitude in your chosen field, and allows you to perform head and shoulders above your less fortunate peers, and a talent at related unstructured magic.%%%%Unlike the usual bloodlines, this doesn't reduce your Mana Magnitude, as it was already 'accounted for' by your benefactor.,,
Mark of the Divine,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Free for "Agent of the Divine"%%%%This acts as a capstone booster for other perks.%%%%Your soul is encased in an indestructible matrix of divine energy. This matrix stabilizes your Mana flow and enhances your Mana Magnitude, doubling it, while allowing you to retain your Shaping Skills in spite of your monstrous reserves. Unlike Zach's, this does not come with a contract attached to it, and you are free to act as you will.,,
Student - Shaping Breakdown,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You are capable of breaking down any spell into multiple, simple steps and/or exercises, which can in turn be taught to anyone with magical potential. Such exercises also enhance your ability to manage and reduce Mana wastage.,,
Student - A Scholar's Touch,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have a deep understanding of how to study new subjects. Such things are almost instinctual to you, and you have a sixth sense of where learning materials for any given material will be, if it exists at all.,,
Student - Boundless Learning,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Enhances your ability to learn. What would take you years of dedicated study now takes a week of intense study for the same result. You have immense ability at adapting knowledge from one field to function at another; i.e. using Dimensionalism to bypass a shield spell in magical combat.,,
Student - Impossible? Improbable!,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,There is no such thing as impossible for you, only the improbable and the ignorance of the population. To you, what truly sets a Mage apart is the ability to seeing through the illusion of the 'Impossible' and understanding the truth that anything is possible. This grants you the ability to work on and crack the code on 'impossible' feats. This takes time and effort, but eventually, you will be able to achieve your goal, no matter how unrealistic.%%%%In theory, you could even bypass a 'Mind Blank' spell, the absolute Mind-Magic defense, and affect a Mage's mind!%%%%%%Capstone Boosted:%%You eat the impossible for breakfast. Your ability to analyze, comprehend and break through the limits of your chosen subject is heightened and accelerated. What would take years of dedicated research, how barely takes a week.,,
Heir - Heir to a Noble House,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,There are all sorts of limits that become irrelevant if you’re well-bred enough. Enrolling into the academy and learning magic before your peers, becoming an active mage before you’re twelve, that sort of thing. With this perk, doors open to you whenever you mention your family name. Do you want an apprenticeship with an Artificer known to teach no one his craft? He'll be salivating at the thought of your family owning him favors. Just remember that you might have to pay all these people back one day. Or not, depending on the circumstances...%%%%This follows you on after this jump, whenever you are part of a well-known family, others will trip over themselves to gain your favor, offering pretty much anything they can in order to improve their social standing.,,
Heir - Ancient Knowledge,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Your house is ancient, and so, you have had access to knowledge and training forgotten or unknown to the world at large. Unfortunately, this doesn't grant you world-dominating powers, as older spells and techniques tend to be rather unimpressive in scope. What advantage this grants, however, is specialized training in all your 'innate' abilities that are shared by your relatives;%%%%Specialized Shaping exercises for families with larger-than-average Mana Magnitude, training exercises to master your unique bloodline and so on.%%%%This essentially affords you a few year's worth of specialized training for all your unique abilities that are found in your family, along with knowledge of ancient arts and traditions that are no longer practiced in modern society.,,
Heir - Art of Blood,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Most, if not all nobles houses have either fiddled with it at some point, or married someone who did, in order to gain a fancy, heritable power. This power is now yours; You have comprehensive training, skill and knowledge of Blood Magic and its applications in creating bloodlines. You can go straight to the heart of the matter and 'build' a new bloodline based on a creature's abilities, devise a ritual to imbue it into yourself or others and have it become hereditary; You could give rise to an entire new 'noble house' all by yourself.%%%%Do take note that this is not without risks or drawbacks, as potent abilities have equally large drawbacks, such as mana requirements; creatures with immensely powerful abilities are, effectively, trapped in high mana environments as they require more mana than their souls produce, and 'starve' otherwise. Giving yourself the power of a dragon is a good way to being unable to leave the Dungeon for longer than a couple of hours.,,
Heir - Superior Pedigree,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Your bloodline is hailed as the best thing since sliced bread. All your inherited affinities, bloodline abilities and similar are an order of magnitude more powerful and useful than they would otherwise be; Empathy grows into full-blown Telepathy and mind manipulation right off the door; An affinity for spatial magic would afford you the ability to teleport yourself and others freely with unstructured magic and barely using any Mana at all, and so on.%%%%Unfortunately, such power is ancient and well documented by both the local government and your ancestral enemies, so expect them to have counters for you should you decide to act out.%%%%%%Capstone Boosted:%%Your bloodline is an extremely well-kept secret. No one outside your immediate family and those you trust with your life know about it. Not only that, but your bloodline has been streamlined and improved by countless ancestors over the ages;%%%%Any and all drawbacks inherent to your bloodlines are faded to almost nothing.%%%%Did your innate Fire affinity cause you to have bouts of irrational anger? Did your Mind-magic affinity cause you headaches when going out in public? Did your affinity for Soul-magic cause megalomania and god-complexes? No longer.%%%%This applies to bloodlines acquired in other jumps;%%%%A Sharingan would require only mild stress to activate and seeing a comrade be injured rather than brutally murder in order to 'evolve', for example.,,
Teacher - Discipline Master,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Pick a field of study. You now have as much understanding, experience and knowledge as an average master of the field; enough to teach pupils or have a commission from the government.%%%%Fields of study include, but are not limited to; Projection, Negation, Animation, Divination, Alteration, Wards, Dimensionalism, Conjuration, Transformation, Summoning, Illusionism, Medical Magic, Combat Magic, Mind Magic, Soul Magic, Spell Formulas, Alchemy, Blood Magic and more.,,
Teacher - Repitition is the Mother of...,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,Your teaching skills are world-class. You could fit an entire month's worth of learning into a single class, and have your students actually learn the material. You also gain the ability to teach through unorthodox methods, such as flicking mana-infused marbles at your students, and have it actually help them learn mana-sensing. It won't make them hate you less, though.,,
Teacher - Unrivalled Mastery,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Your skill in every single field you picked to be a 'Subject Master' of are enhanced, not only in breadth of knowledge but in depth and sheer versatility. You could duplicate Xvim's skill at doing essentially everything with Shaping Exercises, from lifting marbles to breaching a teleportation ward and erecting reactive mind-shields.%%%%And this applies to all fields you master, your skill bleeding through other areas as your expertise rises.%%%%You could weaponize Dimensionalism, use Fire Magic for healing, and so on. You are considered an absolute authority at your chosen fields by anyone who knows of your ability and skill.,,
Teacher - Archmagus,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Like Ikosian mages of the old, you’ve found that the best way to increase your magical capabilities is plagiarism. Look at a natural ability, then deconstruct it into new into a set of new spells. Your spell-crafting skills are impressive enough on their own, but given an example of a supernatural ability, you can easily reconstruct that ability as a brand new discipline of magic; ranging from turning an Aranea's natural psychic abilities into a set of mind-control, mind-reading, and mental defense spells, to turning a dragon’s fire-breath into flame-throwing spells, to nearly any other ability you can name.%%%%%%Capstone Boosted:%%Your ability to plagiarize is enhanced beyond the wildest dreams of most mages. Not only can you reformat the abilities of magical creatures as spells, but also any esoteric phenomena.%%%%You could replicate superpowers, clarketech, magic items and even divine/celestial phenomenon (Though be sure to mind the lightning bolts if you do.).%%%%You could even devise 'theoretical' abilities and devise spells from them, though in the latter case you naturally will encounter failure if your theories prove false, in addition to research and prototyping taking a prohibitively long time to do.,,
Independent - Business Mastery,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You have immense insight at sniffing out and seizing opportunities for advancement. Aside from this, your skill at negotiation and business are such that they grant you effective immunity to being the target of grudges and vendettas from business deals. You are able to negotiate and talk with your worst enemy as if they were a neutral party, and have them consider your terms based on their merit, rather than simply ignoring you.,,
Independent - Unique Marketing Skill,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have a unique, very valuable ability, and a large surplus of skill at using it, that can be very marketable if you put it just right.%%%%This can be anything 'learnable' with some effort, from Soul-sight to crafting wands, scrolls, golems, and other such magical skills, to more mundane things, such as Beekeeping, Accounting or Map-Making.%%%%The point is that this skill could easily land you a job, if only you present it the right way.,,
Independent - Pioneer,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,You are an expert at introducing new concepts to societies and large groups. This can range from convincing your friends to use a specific product to ensuring a new form of technology is accepted by the population at large.%%%%Not only that, but your creativity at marketing techniques and public relations is enhanced; You could sell sin to saints!,,
Independent - The Famed Adventurer,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Survival. Exploration. Discovery. You are a master at these things, practically stumbling over the remains of ancient civilizations like other people stumble into fast-food joints. This perk enhances your ability to discover ancient ruins, unlock their secrets and take them for your own to world-class levels, while making it look easy to everyone else! Adventure on!%%%%%%Capstone Boosted:%%Every adventurer needs a party. After all, who's going to carry all the loot? Not you! This causes everyone working for/with you to rapidly gain in skill and capability, reaching the levels of a top tier professional in a short span of time.%%%%Even scraping the bottom of the barrel isn't a problem, your companions will be the equal of anyone else in the business quickly enough as long as they aren’t just completely incapable.,,
Items,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Each Origin gets its 100cp item for free, and a discount on the rest of its items. You can import similar items into any of these at no additional cost. Any item can be taken multiple times, but 100cp Origin items are discounted instead of free after the first purchase. If these items are lost, stolen, or destroyed, new ones will be in the Warehouse 24 hours later.,,
The Looper Diaries,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Self-updating, detailed description of your adventures. This persists between Time-Loop iterations.,,
Mana Crystals,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A box of Crystallized Mana. Can be used for a large number of things. Crafting magic items, golems, selling for profit, weighing down paper and bouncing off the forehead of annoying little sisters. Your imagination is the limit!,,
Wraith Bomb,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A small item, contained a number of trapped Wraiths. Pull the cord and throw it; it then releases a number of undead monsters that in turn make more of themselves. Good for depopulating an unsuspecting city. You monster.,,
Hammerspace,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,You have a small pocket dimension in your soul, which you can use to carry objects and beings. Anything in your Hammerspace is in temporal stasis, and is incapable of acting or aging. Since this is contained within your Soul, all stored things persist between Time-Loop iterations.%%%%You can 'store' anything you're directly touching. You can store up to three times your own mass and volume in total.,,
Airship,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,The peak of technology. Allows you to travel immense distances with ease, while carrying a large amount of cargo. This particular Airship was developed to be drivable by a single person.,,
The Cure to Aging,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Did you steal from a particularly weird Witch?%%%%This is a bottle contained a perfected brew that halts the aging of whoever drinks it, and grants a rather potent healing factor. It also comes with a set of scribbled notes teaching how to make more, and insulting the intelligence and capability of whoever reads them.,,
Seraphic Gate,,2,,-8000,,True,,True,,A copy of an artifact made by the Gods, from the corpse of their defeated enemies. This particular enemy is brain-dead and can't really interact with you, even if you bypass the security features.%%%%If you activate the Seraphic Gate, you initiate a Time-Loop, essentially creating a month-long simulation of the world you're in.%%%%You have 1000 Time-Loop iterations to explore, learn and play around in after each activation of the Seraphic Gate, after which it must 'recharge' for three years.%%%%Using a Seraphic Gate while inside another Seraphic Gate is... unwise.,,
Student - Acceptance At School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,This item guarantees your place at an institution of your choice, regardless of how competitive or difficult it is to get in. It also means all your education is paid for. Enjoy!,,
Student - In Cold Blood,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The most feared weapon of all fantasy settings. A Gun.%%%%This particular gun is enchanted to 'conjure' bullets as you fire, never running out of ammunition.,,
Student - Minor Magic Item,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A magic item of your choice, as long as it isn't an artifact-grade object. This can range from bags of holding to alcohol-to-sugar transmutation rings. The item comes with schematics, blueprints and instructions on how to make more.,,
Student - Scroll of Knowledge,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,....Did you take a stroll to Faêrun when I wasn't looking?%%%%This is a magical, self-updating scroll. It 'absorbs' and contains all knowledge in the world, adding to itself whenever you visit new worlds. It changes to reflect the subject matter you wish to study, and shows you exactly what you need to learn to advance to the next level, changing itself once again when you master the current text.%%%%Keep in mind that the scroll draws from knowledge already existing in the world, so if something hasn't been done before, it can't teach you how to do it.,,
Heir - Ancestral Home,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,This is an ancient house, built to your specifications. It is on the extremely opulent side, with every luxury imaginable available. While it doesn't comes with any guards or servants, it does have all the paraphernalia you need to hire and equip them.,,
Heir - Noble Fortune,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Ah, fortune and riches. You have complete access to your family fortune. Unless you go out showering the common folk in gold, don't expect to run out of gold anytime soon.,,
Heir - Family Spells,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A collection of extremely rare spell scrolls belonging to a field of your choice, regardless of its legality.,,
Heir - Private Black Room,,2,,-6000,,True,,True,,Your family is one of the few into the national secret of the Black Rooms; and you have your own. Hidden deep in one of your properties, it allows you to extend a day into a month. Remember to stock up on perishables!,,
Teacher - Private Library,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A small collection of rare tomes, focusing on a field of your choice. This can be used to learn or teach a Discipline to a high degree of mastery.,,
Teacher - Scroll Collection,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A collection of every spell publicly available. While it won't make you a monster on the battlefield or an archmagus on its own, its more than enough to get started.,,
Teacher - Little Black Book,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,You've been in the game a long time, and you have the blackmail to show it. This small book is filled in with names and secrets of dozens of high-profile mages, craftsmen and otherwise important people. Use it as you will.,,
Teacher - A Master's Grimoire,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,A single, leather-bound book that is the magnum opus of a very talented mage. This can be used to learn most, if not all, spells and techniques of a single discipline, along with tricks and suggestions on how to apply your power in the best possible ways.,,
Independent - A Thriving Business,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your own business! It affords you a modest living, as long as you put in a few hours of work each day. It comes with all necessary documentation and permits for whatever trade you might ply!,,
Independent - Ancient Spell Tablets,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A few stone tablets describing how to perform ancient magic. Be aware that ancient spells are clunky, hard to use and can have unforeseen consequences.,,
Independent - Red Robe,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,This article of clothing is extremely well-crafted, using rare and expensive materials. It renders you all but immune to direct applications of magic, requiring overwhelming amounts of skill and power to overcome its protections.,,
Independent - Ancient Artifact,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have in your possession a Divine Artifact with seemingly impossible properties and abilities. The properties of this item need to be possible in-world, but are then taken 'to the next level'. Maybe it works as a Mana Battery that doesn't lose its affinity to you, doubling your reserves. Or perhaps its a portable palace in a pocket dimension. Regardless, the artifact is sure to be priceless. Keep it hidden. Keep it safe.,,
This is My Story,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Toggleable drawback. Allows you to replace either Zach or Zorian. Zach-inserts must take Agent of the Divine.%%%%Cannot be taken with "A Side Character".,,
A Side Character,,4,,00,,False,,False,,Toggleable drawback. Allows you to replace a canon character, with the exception of Zach and Zorian.%%%%Cannot be taken with "This Is My Story".,,
MORNING, MORNING, MORNING!,,4,,2000,,True,,False,,Your starting situation in the Time-Loop is... annoying. It isn't anything you can't deal with, but it will certainly end up driving up the wall after a certain point. It could be a little sister that wakes you up by jumping on your stomach, a killer hang-over from the 'night before', or anything in the same vein.,,Retail rocker
Magic? Pfft. Who needs Magic?,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You suck at magic. Any exercise, spell or magical discipline will take twice as long to study, understand and master. Magic just doesn't come naturally to you.,,
Outcast,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You are a social outcast to society at large. You can still have friends who see past this, but to the world, nothing good can come from you. Maybe you hail from a family of cannibals, or maybe your mother was a Witch, or else your once noble and proud house broke a number of promises and all nobility thinks you're lower than dirt.%%%%Pick your poison.,,
Unstable Bloodline,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Must have a Bloodline%%%%Your bloodline has a few unwanted side-effects related to their ability, which are much worse than they would otherwise be.%%%%An Empath normally gets headaches without proper training, and instinctively avoid people; you would be practically agoraphobic. Someone with a Fire-based bloodline would find themselves prone to extreme bouts of anger, and Shapeshifers would be slaves to their inner animals.%%%%The side-effects are always related to the bloodline in some way, and will always have a large effect on your quality of life, even if you somehow manage to find work arounds.,,
Absolutely Scrumptious,,4,,4000,,True,,False,,...Did you bathe in meat sauce and pheromones? Because to the inhabitants of the Dungeons, you might as well have. Monsters will always go for you first, second and third, and they will try to eat, breed and do unspeakable things to you if given half a chance. Even the otherwise sapient and sometimes peaceful inhabitants of the Dungeon will have trouble controlling their urges around you. Why would you pick this?,,Retail rocker
Person of Interest,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Choose a faction. (Must be a group larger than 5 and have higher-than-average power.) This faction now wants you to either join them, or die. Mind you, you can't just pick someone you like and then join them, they will want you for your power, knowledge, resources or whatever else you might have, and only that.%%%%They will have absolutely no problem in using less-than-legal or ethical means of ensuring and enforcing your loyalty. Expect mind-control, geas, blackmail and worse.,,
Blurring Days,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Who can remember what happened in a specific circumstance, fifty iterations ago?! Not you.%%%%Your life in the Time-Loop continues as usual, but the little details sort of blur together. Expect to commit continuity errors when interacting with people, such as referencing a conversation that never happened, or commenting about a secret you were never told. Oops.,,
Tiny Soul,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Your Mana Magnitude is half of what it should be. While this does afford you a head-start in controlling what little power you have, you will never be able to reach the heights a regular Mage can, or cast as many spells.,,
Nemesis,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,You have an enemy. This enemy has somehow added him or herself into the Time-Loop and is out to get you killed. This can range from having you ambushed first thing in a Loop, to engineering to have you expelled or fired repeatedly... This enemy will grow stronger as time passes, and will eventually figure out how to take you out if you don't kill them first.%%%%If only there was a way to permanently kill someone in the Time-Loop...,,
Agent of the Divine,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,You have entered the Seraphic Gate with a contract printed on your Soul, burdened with glorious, divine purpose. The specifics of the contract are up to you and a rather high-up angel in the celestial order. Did I mention that the negotiations of this contract will happen while you're asleep and dreaming? And that Angels have nothing better to do than learn how to twist mortals around to serve the purpose of the gods?,,
Slave to Your Flesh,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,This... might have been a mistake. You made a pact with He-Of-Flowing-Flesh to get into the Time Loop goodness, and you have until a month after the completion of the Time-Loop to free the Eldritch abomination from its dimensional cage, or your Life, Soul (and Jumpchain) is forfeit.,,
Agent of Destruction,,4,,10000,,False,,False,,Oh, boy. You decided to side with the evil, eldritch abominations that want to devour the world and splatter the gods all over the continent. And everyone knows it. Expect armies, adventurers, dragons, angels and ancient monsters from the beginning of time to come after you and stop your plans, whatever they may be.%%%%This persecution lasts for the duration of the Jump, and the only way to stop it prematurely is to, in a word, win. Though you might find that victory rather... hollow.,,
