Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Location,,0,,00,,False,,False,,There are many places to start in this place, however only one plane- The Throne. The Throne is the center of the multiverse, and where the Seven rule from. Many dangers lurk in this city, but there is also much opportunity to be had. Roll (or use an RNG) 1d9 to find out your location.%%%%Ashton- the home of Dragonsgate, the most famous and most used Gate into the Throne, this location is divided into 2 sub-districts: Outer Ashton, formed on the outside of the walls, and Inner Ashton, the inside of the walls. This place is the most populated part of the Throne, being the place most immigrants and pilgrims and the like start out at.%%%%Old King’s Road- The center of commerce in the Throne, and perhaps even the entire multiverse, the Road operates under the rule of Neutrality, where even the most vicious rivals may not so much as lift a finger against their enemy. The Road is packed with shops, from the highest class of restaurants the lowliest of stalls. Oddly enough, the Throne doesn’t have an established currency, so you might want to find something else to pay with.%%%%Furnace- The forges of the Throne, this place is believed to be the oldest district in the entire throne. From here, almost all forged goods, including weaponry, jewelry, and general crafted items are forged. This district, however, is among the most dangerous, as despite the lack of crime, a smog that can choke a man in minutes exists here.%%%%Spires- Connected to the Furnace, this location stands high up, with skyscrapers being the only thing that exist here. This is the most often used location for incoming nobility and upper class people, so it also boasts some of the best restaurants in the city. It is also famous for its massive Red-light district, though touching the merchandise if forbidden, and if you break it they might have to kill you.%%%%Palaces- The first of the 3 inner rings of the city, this is where all the richest people in the Throne live. They are just as brutal as the rest of the city, but they are better at hiding it. Beyond that, there is also the City of Night, the part of the district that is blocked from the sun. In there, you can find all sorts of interesting goodies.%%%%Sanctum- The 2nd of the 3 circles, this location is ruins, ones from the Universal War, the war where the Demiurges fought to the death, and only seven survived. With the amount of ruins, the universities and other places of education have popped up%%%%Sacred Spoke- The 3rd circle of the 3 circles, this place if forbidden from interaction by non-demiurges, and any intruders will either be put down by the guards, or even the Demiurges themselves. The Sacred Spoke is actually full of ruins, and corpses of Demiurges still litter the street, and ancient war machines lean on the destroyed ruins of buildings.%%%%The Shades- The poorest part of the city, and the most unfortunate to be born in, the Shades put most shanty towns and slums to shame. Practically ruled by gangs, the best advice for those that start here is to get as far away as possible, as quickly as possible.%%%%Free Pick- choose one of the locations above.,,
The Fated,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?Some people have delusions of grandeur. Thoughts of gaining power over everyone else. Thoughts of being an unstoppable Juggernaut. Most of these people end up dying in gutters and drains, with no one caring about some idealistic fool. Such is the nature of this cruel world. However, sometimes one of these fools truly achieves something great. Just enough people reach this level to guide more fools to their doom. Which fool you are is up to you. Just remember; this is a world ruled by beasts, and they have little tolerance for those that hope to change that.,,
The Master,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?There are many forms of art, from many worlds across many universes. It is only natural that some would seek mastery of arts. From cooking to forging to martial arts, there are as many forms of art as there are practitioners. However, few of these students truly master what they do. But not you. Within you lies an ability and skill that puts you above most of the other practitioners. Just keep in mind, there is still much to learn.,,
The Beggar,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?Most residents of the wheel are poor, and defenseless. But even below them are people even less fortunate. Whether they live in a barrel in the center of a market, or something else, they are barely getting by, and sometimes not even that much. However, within these lost souls like a fire, one that, if properly dealt with, could become a blazing inferno.,,
The Fury,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?In this age of beasts, it is no surprise that some people embrace the inner beast. These people, at the risk of losing themselves, can become an engine of destruction. The people who follow this path often end up dying or losing themselves to their inner beast, and thus must be put down. But some avoid this fate, becoming truly powerful beings.,,
The Law,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?Despite everything, there are still laws in the Throne. Most ignore them, and do whatever they want, but there are some who follow and enforce these laws. They are a minority, and often end up enforcing only the rules they care about, or ones they made up. Idealism, after all, is just comforting lies we tell ourselves to have hope that things might get better. This path is wrought with failures and people that would like to see you twisted to their own ends. But keep control of yourself, and move forward. Maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.,,
The Boss,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?There are many guilds across the multiverse. Some deal in slaves, others in drugs, and so on. But this isn’t an automatic thing, someone must watch over these transactions. That's where you come in. Whether you are a small gang leader, an overseer for a guild, or such, you have power, more than most people have. Just remember: there are those that are willing to do many things to get to where you are.,,
The Refined,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?You are not just any fool who walks the street. You are royalty; someone important enough, at least to the 7 or the guilds, that you can live in comfort. But why do that, when you can go out and twist the world to your will? But pride cometh before the fall, and it's quite a long fall, so be careful.,,
The Hunter,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?Mercenary, assassin, serial killer, all names for a simple profession- killing others. There is always a demand for those that are skilled in the act of ending lives, and you will see much work being provided for you. Maybe you can even reach heaven from a mountain of corpses?,,
The Hunger,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?The Art of Lying to God, or as known to the less informed worlds, Magic, is quite a useful thing. Though little can actually so much as start to comprehend how it works, you seem to have grasped a bit of it. While you start off small, the Art is one of the most useful things in the wheel. Just be careful; there are many that seek your secrets.,,
The Outsider,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Drop In%%%%?You’re not from around here, are you? It seems you have made the next step in the direction of absolute power. But this step is one full of peril. A world going to shit, and the only people that can change it are either dead, missing, or doing their own thing. Maybe you can carve your own path in this world?,,
Humans,,0,,00,,False,,False,,?The Classic choice. Born from Aesma’s creation, they are flawed. But despite that, they are the most widespread species in the throne, and they make up 5 of the 7 demiurges. In this setting, humans aren’t limited to what we see on earth. They can have differently colored hair, skin, and other things. So long as it looks human, its viable. Humans are also more willful than any other species, and have a higher potential for power. Human shades, while the in the void, are black.%%%%Age is 16+2d8,,
Servant,,0,,00,,False,,True,,?Created from the fingernail of YISUN by the god Koss, he spent 1 year and 1 day making them. Servants are immortal, so long as they are not killed. They are also bound to what they were created for, and therefore are less driven and less willful.%%%%You have access to the Servant Creation table.%%%%Age is 100+2d100,,
Devil,,0,,00,,False,,True,,?Create from the Hot Black Flame, these self-serving and egotistical beings are from the void. They are originally unbound, meaning they were feral, though they are quite powerful in the unbound state. By giving a Devil a mask, they grow less powerful, but they become smarter and sentient. You start as a Blue Devil, the second lowest mask type, though you have potential for growth. Age is not something that applies to Devils, therefore you don’t need to roll anything.,,
Angel,,0,,-2000,,False,,True,,?Weapons of destruction, made to enforce the God’s laws, and put down Servant rebellions, they are arguably the deadliest race out there, though there are still people of other races that outpace them. You are a creature of the void, where you can exist in your true form. In order to stay in Reality, you must gain a shell, which, while comparable to a “constantly exploding nuke”, you lose most of your power in real world. Even then, though, you are a force to be reckoned with. Like Devils, Angels simply don’t age, and you can choose how your shell looks.,,
The Fated - Hope,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Hope. Perhaps the biggest lie. To have hope is to have your dreams smashed and belief shattered. But this lie can also fuel you. When you have Hope, no matter what it is, it is much harder to break you. Perhaps sometimes lies are helpful.,,
The Fated - Martyr,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,So many people die without getting anywhere. Most people died expecting something great, only to be let down and alone in their last moments. But at least you can bring them down with you.%%%%If you were to die, you would kill the person who killed you. No matter what protection a person have, if you die they die.%%%%However, this only works when you are killed by another sentient being: jumping off a cliff, nor slitting your own wrists, will work.,,
The Fated - Brightest Star,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Get enough power, and people will look up to you. Doesn’t matter who, or why, but you can use this to your advantage. You, at will, may start glowing a bright white light, and allies within the light are motivated and moralized, while enemies in it are demoralized.,,
The Fated - Heat of the Voice,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Some heroes from myths across the Wheel, about heroes who could whip an army into shape with a short speech. And now you follow in their footsteps. You are good at giving “pep talks” to your allies, and when you do, your allies are more effective in battle than they would normally be.,,
The Fated - Vengeful Star,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The thing about battle is, in most cases, the warrior is at their best state at the beginning of the battle. As the battle continues, they become wounded, tired, and sometimes unwilling to fight. But at least you can hurt your enemy just as badly as they harm you.%%%%When you are hit, you may inflict the same amount of damage you have taken on your enemy. The more enemies you're fighting, the more dispersed the damage is, and it is less damage they take.%%%%Of course, this won’t help against someone completely immune to any and all attempts at harm, but anything less than that is gonna be damaged, though magical effects from the wound don’t spread with the damage.,,
The Fated - Destiny,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,There are many stories from many worlds, about heroes defeating nigh-impossible odds. They are mostly bullshit, made to placate the masses about how someone might come and save them. But maybe you are different?%%%%By writing a story about yourself, you may follow the path written. You go the way your story went, all the way to the end. Well, at least theoretically.%%%%Any tests you set for yourself must be overcome without the help of the Story, and “I win” stories simply don’t work. So, don’t expect to defeat Jagganoth just because your story says you did.,,
The Fated - Hero of Legend,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,So many heroes out there on so many worlds. Maybe you want to imitate them? You naturally seem to attract, or maybe you are attracted to, points where you can go on an adventure. If you force it, maybe you can even end up along with the major players in the world?%%%%%%Boosted:%%Not only are you attracted to adventures, but these adventures tend to be a scale as to rival the main character’s story. While this depends on where you go, it will always only be rivaled by the overarching plot.,,
The Fated - Armor of Will,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Realistically, most heroes would die early in their adventures. But that would be boring. You aren’t gonna die to something as petty as falling down the stairs, are you?%%%%You have plot armor, and this has the effect of being hard to kill, unless said attack was deliberate. You avoid accidents by centimeters, walk out of a building shortly before it explodes, and more. However, as was said earlier, if it's a deliberate attack against you, then this plot armor is less effective against that.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Your plot armor increases to such an extent that only a deliberate, planned attack on your life would kill you.,,
The Master - Mundane Martial Arts,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,While some people have some fancy schmancy advanced martial arts that can break reality, but you can make do with what you have. Choose one martial art from our earth, and master it perfectly.,,
The Master - Hard Bitten,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,One of the flaws of fighting with your own body is how fragile your form is, with the flesh ripping and bones breaking after a few strikes on the enemy. Not anymore.%%%%Now, you can no longer wound your own body, by striking something too hard, or too often. This isn’t to say you are gonna survive your body being overloaded with energy, nor is it gonna protect against external attacks, but you no longer have to worry about hitting something too hard.,,
The Master - The Wise,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,There must be something special about you, because people seem to look up to you. They seem to take your sayings as wise teachings, and they tend to ignore your shortcomings, saying they are flawed.%%%%Doesn’t help against someone if they already hate you, but it's a start.,,
The Master - Swat at Flies,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Guns, in the world of today, are rare. Not extremely rare, but rare enough that you only occasionally see one. Regardless, they are potent, able to pierce most armor, especially the more advanced ones. You, however, can change.%%%%When attacked with a bullet, or other physical projectile the equal to or smaller than your hand, you can “swat” the bullet from the sky, stopping it from hitting you. You can do this 5 times a day.,,
The Master - Mountain Rooting Step,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Just because you are small doesn’t mean you are a pushover. By standing still and focusing, you become immovable. That doesn’t mean that people can’t harm you, of course, it justs means you can't be pushed back.,,
The Master - Great Master,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It seems your reputation has spread. Good, it makes it all the easier to get students and followers. The wiser and more famous you are, the more potential followers you get.,,
The Master - Teacher of the Ages,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You might be a good master, but a good teacher? With this, you are both. You may teach anything you have learned, regardless how complex it is, in about a year. And those easy-to-master arts? You can teach them even faster.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Not only can you teach, but those you teach can teach it just as well as soon as they learned it, and so on.,,
The Master - Wide Reputation,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You must have done something big, because it seems like everyone knows about you, even if what they heard isn’t 100% true. Your actions tend to cause big ripples, ones that affect everyone around you. On top of that, your actions tend to grow in size and ridiculousness, the more people know about them.%%%%%%Boosted:%%To say you have a wide reputation is downplaying it. Almost everyone in the setting knows your name (or at least what you call yourself), and they all view you how you want to be viewed.,,
The Beggar - Habitual Drunk,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It is hard to outdrink you. It seems something in your body craves the stuff, and you need it badly. No one, no matter who, can ever outdrink you. Ever.,,
The Beggar - Drunken Brawler,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,While drunk, it appears luck and fortune are on your side. When drunk, not only do you become stronger than normal, but you also become more likely, dodging at the perfect moments to avoid attacks, and such.,,
The Beggar - Squash the Dog’s Back,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,There must be something in you, because when you strike someone, you hit hard. Your attacks seem to have a gratuitous amount of gore and bloodiness to them, and it is even more painful than the attack would have been normally. While it also boosts the damage you do to people, its not by much.,,
The Beggar - Impossible Weapons,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,It looks like they have you cornered and unarmed. Fools. They just aren’t creative enough to use everything you got. You can use almost anything as a weapon, from a 2x4 to a potted plant to a clay idol. Never again will you be defenseless.,,
The Beggar - Enemy Mine,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Sometimes petty rivalries can get in the way, but not when you are around. You can make people who hate each other, including yourself, work together. This, however, doesn’t mean they are gonna enjoy it, and they may also backstab each other when a chance presents itself.,,
The Beggar - Tracker,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,When on the run, people tend to make mistakes, including ones that anyone else would call obvious flaws. Thankfully, when looking for someone, you can use this to your advantage. On top of giving you skill in tracking someone, fate is on your side, with you being able to find clues as to where your target ran off to.,,
The Beggar - Thanks for the Noodles,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Most people don’t seem to expect the homeless, frail person to be badasses. Whether that description fits you, people underestimate you all the same. Even when given ample warning, they will expect you to be weaker than you actually are. Even those that fought you before seem to fall into this trap, with them thinking this time will be different.%%%%%%Boosted:%%People seem to forget about hurting you, as they feel you are too weak to fight. They also treat you with pity, and hold back, not wanting to hurt you.,,
The Beggar - Just Getting By,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,In these days, it is so easy to fall into the pits of despair. With all the power being held by a fraction of a fraction of the population, everyone else serves them in some way. However, you will never fall into the pits of despair as they do. Your mental state, no matter how badly damaged, will always continue to repair itself, never going down.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You can help others get better, as well as yourself.,,
The Fury - Rage,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Like any beast, you can go into a berserker rage. You feel no pain, can take much more punishment, and brutalize your enemies even more than usual. However, when you are out of this rage, all the pain and damage you ignored will come flooding in a single moment.,,
The Fury - Coat of Scars,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Some scars look cool. Some look ugly. But, regardless of what people think they look like, they are generally useless in a fight. At least, to other people. For you, the more scarred and damaged a place is, the more durable the area is.,,
The Fury - Tiger’s Blood,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Looks can get you far in the Throne. Some mercenaries, assassins, and general killers are hired just for having an imposing figure. Like them, you look pretty threatening. While I’ll leave the specifics to you, you generally have an aura of “don’t fuck with me” around you. Just try to have strength to back up your looks.,,
The Fury - Tiger Eye Technique,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Whether through genetics, experimentation, or something else, you simply see through Darkness as if it were bright in the room. Useful for going around in the depths of the city.,,
The Fury - Boiling Blood,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Some people say the only way to fight properly is to know what you are doing at all times. But this doesn’t apply to you.%%%%The more reckless you are in battle, the more damage you can soak and the more pain you can deal out.%%%%Also, as a side effect, your body is so brutal that when you bleed, the blood literally sprays at your enemy at such a force it can damage them even through plate armor.,,
The Fury - Meti’s Technique,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,By calling your attack, you become much more lethal to your target. When you target a single person, all your attacks against them are far, far more lethal and brutal. What could have bruised them before would go right through them with this.,,
The Fury - Claws of the Beast,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Requires Rage%%%%To rage is to lose yourself to your inner beast. Well, at least in theory. There are some that managed to keep their skills while berserking, and now you are among their numbers.%%%%When you lose all the chains holding you back, you don’t lose any skill in weapons or attack methods or martial arts.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Not only are your items just as deadly, but they are now even more deadly, causing much more destruction than normal each time you swing your blade.,,
The Fury - The Bloody,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The more people you slaughter with your own weapons and body, the more dangerous you become. All your attacks become more effective, your armor becomes harder to pierce, and your enemies become more squishy. The buff, however, depends on how much of a threat to you your enemy is, so seeking out armies of weaklings won’t change much, while someone who stands on an equal or greater stance than you have a much larger boost.%%%%%%Boosted:%%It is a treasure to see you in battle. You are capable or ripping your way straight through an army, without much harm done to you.,,
The Law - Wield the Old Law,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The old law, the law that the Angels follow, is extremely complex and hard to understand. But somehow you know it front to back perfectly. You know what are rules, violations, and loopholes you can abuse.%%%%When you go to a world different from this one, you instinctively know the rules of said world.,,
The Law - Famous Iron Soul,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,When wearing armor, the armor feels like nothing on you, and doesn’t inhibit your stamina at all, regardless of how thick and heavy the armor is.,,
The Law - Burning Finger,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,When you touch someone, you may trigger extreme, unbearable pain in the area you are touching, and you may also cripple the limb you are touching. Useful for threatening, and “interrogation”.,,
The Law - Het Transforms into a Pillar of Basalt,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Maybe someone threatens you, or thought they could get away with what they were doing, or maybe they looked at you the wrong way.%%%%Regardless, by focusing on someone, they seem to do less damage toward you. While simple, it can be useful in some circumstances.,,
The Law - Unlimited Chariot,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Why let petty things like walls or cages stop you? It seems that objects designed to keep you out, or keep you in, are like paper under your blows. Let nothing hold your justice back.,,
The Law - The Watchful,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,One of the problems with angels in this day and age is that they are quite corrupt, unwilling to help, or just outright uncaring.%%%%Whether you are an angel, you never become disconnected from those you are protecting, regardless of the power you hold or how far away you are in either mind or body.,,
The Law - We Shall Make an Anvil of Their Skulls, and My Heart Shall be the Forge,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,There is much evil in the Throne. Slavers, criminal empires, uncaring gods.... It's quite a big shtishow. But maybe you can change that?%%%%With this power, the more evil a person is, the stronger your blows against them. Let them hide, for Justice has come.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Evil burns in your presence, and any evil actions (other than your own) within 100 meters causes extreme pain and agony to the perpetrator.,,
The Law - Watchman's Eye,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Evil is not something obvious. It is hidden, and while sometimes it's obvious, the most black of all evil is often the best hidden. But by looking at someone, all their sins are laid out at you. Their intentions, their crimes, their merits, their accomplishments. Justice sees all.%%%%%%Not only are their sins laid out to you, but they also become a loyal servant to you, seeking redemption through death. This does not work on this with powerful wills, but even they can still feel it.,,
The Boss - Shining Boss,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Gang leaders tend to be obvious in what they truly are. They wear all kinds of bling, and expensive ones at that. Despite this, whether through fear or respect or something else, no ones even thinks of stealing from you. To them, it doesn’t matter if you are dressed in rags or a suit made of gold; they simply will ignore it.,,
The Boss - That’s Our Boss!,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Morale is important, and you have taken this to heart. Just by existing, your followers are full of pride just because they follow you. May not seem like much, but it helps with insurrection issues.,,
The Boss - Swell Ranks,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Downtrodden of this world are so gullible, willing to do anything just to get higher on the social scale. By manipulating this, you are good at finding loyal recruits among the lowest of the low.%%%%They will thank you, even when you are stealing from them.,,
The Boss - Squeeze ‘em Dry,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Even though the Throne doesn't have an established currency, there are still things of value out there. But more often than not they are in possession of someone. So, you take this to its natural conclusion. You always seem to find easy, if not necessarily legal, ways to get money, be it extortion, mercenary work, or more.,,
The Boss - Serious Swagger,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Glorious and Indecent. Those are two words that describe you. When wearing jewelry, fancy clothes, and other expensive stuff, people seem to respect you even more than normal.,,
The Boss - Total Nutters,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Your followers are so loyal, they would die for you. Literally, actually. When you are given orders to your followers, not matter how much they value life, they would gladly sacrifice themselves purely because they respect you that much.,,
The Boss - Nothing to Fuck With,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Sometimes you gotta send a message. The more afraid your enemy is of you, the more you hurt them. Show the world that you are not one to be fucked with.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You are so scary that you are practically an urban legend at this point. The mere mention of your name and that you are coming is enough for a whole gang to surrender.,,
The Boss - Fierce Loyalty,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,People who follow you, seem to look up to you. Whether they see you as a parent, a protector, or simply someone they want to be someday, they respect you nonetheless.%%%%To the point where no matter what it done to them, they will not betray you. Even if they promise the world, your followers would spit in their face, telling them they already serve the man that rules it.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Your “employees” are also good at convincing others from different gangs to sabotage their own organization and join you.,,
The Refined - One Thousand Blooming Flowers,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Guess with all the free time you have, you have worked on some hobbies of yours. Pick one type of art from any period of history up to the early 21st century, and you are the undisputed master of it. This perk can be taken more than once, but only discounts count on the first purchase.,,
The Refined - Mantra of Pravi, the Exquisite,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Must be the way you walk. Or maybe it's the way that you hold yourself? Despite any dirtying you go through, you will always look the way you want to look.,,
The Refined - Flying Sleeves,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Who says you can’t use your own clothes as weapons? Somehow, in battle, you may use your clothes, no matter their fabric or weight, as weapons, and some deadly ones at that.,,
The Refined - Devouring Shadows,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Fear is something present in everyone’s hearts, even the bravest of us. You know how to manipulate this to your advantage. At will, you may summon a personally made nightmare from the shadows, and it resembles whatever the victim’s greatest fear,,
The Refined - House of Smoke,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,From the shadows, you can create some of the most realistic illusions, to the point where even reality is fooled.%%%%Meaning, these illusions, while still illusions, are physical, so you can do stuff like pick up a pan from the kitchen you manifested, and hit an enemy with it.,,
The Refined - Sublime Performance,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,People would pay to see you. When you perform in some way, regardless of the actual skill involved, to onlookers it looks so beautiful they are mesmerized.%%%%Those of strong will can ignore this, and people can be taken out of it by being hurt, but so long as neither of those things comes true then you should be good.,,
The Refined - Cloak and Dagger,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The most vicious and dangerous place isn’t the battlefield. It’s the ballroom. With every noble and upper-class person, there are plots to kill or sabotage each one. You are the undisputed master of this. You can spin courts of nobles around your finger, and destroy people through proxies so complex it will never fall back to you.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Not only can you twist a court around your finger, but you can control how society functions, through proxies or from the court itself.,,
The Refined - King’s Charisma,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Something about you just makes you shine. With every word you say, a life is changed. You are so charismatic that people would die for you, with just a few sentences said. You can turn enemies into allies with a few words. They say words will never hurt you, but you’ll show them the truth.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You may be the most charismatic person in existence. With a few words, you could change the course of history. People who hear a small verse from you, no matter where, would be willing to die for you.,,
The Hunter - Silent as a Mouse,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Stealth is important for assassins, for obvious reasons. Whether you were trained, self-taught, or just experienced, you are a master at stealth, and on top of that, you can fit into areas you shouldn’t be able to fit in, so long as it isn’t ridiculously different in size.,,
The Hunter - Sense Atum,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Atum. The fire that exists in all beings with a soul. Used in many martial arts, it is called “life-force” on some worlds. And you can use it to your advantage. You can sense the Atum (or life-force, in other jumps) of other beings, even through stone or dirt, but not metal of any kind. The further away, the more muddled they are. But hey, it's better than nothing.,,
The Hunter - Toad School Technique,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Whether you bred insects into your skin, altered your own body with sorcery or surgery, or something else, your body has some type of natural weapon. It can also be hidden well, so no need to cover it up, though you should not make it obvious.,,
The Hunter - The Empty One,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,No one can run from you. So long as you know where your target is, and the location of them, you can “teleport” there, so long as the place you teleport to is unwatched.,,
The Hunter - The String Cutter,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Violence, according to YISUN, actually is the answer. When you want change, whether on a small scale or a large scale, you know who to kill to change things the way you want them to be changed. Just be careful, anyone with that much influence probably has some sort of protection.,,
The Hunter - Scorpion School Technique,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,No place is safe, so long as you were there. You know how to bait people, create traps, and plant those traps in there they would be the most useful. You can also make traps at an unusual speed, capable of trapping an enemy base despite the fact you just got there.,,
The Hunter - Murder the Gods and Topple Their Thrones,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Seven are uncaring about the world they rule. They let the guilds and syndicates rule the world for them. But maybe that isn’t good enough for you? You know how to get a revolution started. You are a master and setting up small cells, providing weapons and supplies to your followers, and everything else a revolution requires. Though, this doesn’t help when it comes to actually recruiting people, just with the followers you have.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Fate seems to act on your side, with events happening that heavily favor the growth of a revolution, and events will also make the rulers of the world less powerful and more fragile.,,
The Hunter - Reach Heaven through Violence,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,A common saying across the Wheel is “reach the heavens through violence”, and it appears you have taken that to heart. In a battle, you seem to embody death. Ripping through entire crowds of armed and armored people, without making a noise nor getting a drop of blood or fluids on your outfit. Additionally, when you see something you haven’t fought before nor studied before, you can observe it, and find out its weakness and weak points, though the stronger and harder to kill something is comparatively to you the longer it’ll take, and at some point they would be strong enough that you can’t study them at all.%%%%%%Boosted:%%To call you a killer would be an insult. No, you are the reaper. You can kill anything, even things that cannot die. And even then, they will never have some special attack that would activate automatically if they died, so no death curses or such.,,
The Hunger - Red Arts,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Red Art is associated with changing the existing physical universe or non-animate matter. In layman’s terms, it means you can alter non-living matter, and transmute it into anything. However, this transmutation depends on the difference between the two. Iron into gold is easier than salt water into gold, for example. You also can’t make matter from nothing, requiring matter already there.,,
The Hunger - White Arts,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The White Art is associated with changing the self or the self’s perceptions. In short, you can alter your own body, teleport across the multiverse, aligning your Atum, and so on. This type of the Art is much harder to master, however, making it used only by the most advanced Sorcerers. One other thing: there are rumors that the White Art’s ultimate use is to turn back time. Maybe you’ll see if there are truths to this rumor...,,
The Hunger - Coherency,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Problem with the Arts, is that not saying things correctly can have physical consequences, including death. But that shouldn’t be a worry for you. You will never trip over your own words, always able to properly say what you want to say.,,
The Hunger - Toolless,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Some new practitioners need tools to safely use the Art. You have grown beyond this need for tools. To cast magic, you don’t need any foci to cast your spells. You simply need to say the world, or will it, to cast it.,,
The Hunger - Technomancer,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Sometimes, but rarely, magic is used to enhance technology. You possess this odd skill, and with it, you can make some magical technology, like the Glyphosphere of Mammon’s design.,,
The Hunger - Captivator,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Unbound Devils, for as dangerous as they are, are used to fuel and enhance many kinds of machinery, like Prime Angel Shells or Airship engines. You are skilled in this area, being able to bind Devils or other eldritch beings into objects, and have then enhance said object.,,
The Hunger - Will to Kill,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The thing is with the Art, is that it is often a contest of Will. For example, a will to kill a person must overpower the victim's will to not die. Sometimes, the magic can even be sent back at the caster. But you shouldn’t have this problem. Your will is immense, so much that you shouldn’t need to worry about the magic being sent back or fizzling out, unless you are aiming it at someone like a Demiurge or other similarly powerful beings, due to their will.%%%%%%Boosted:%%No matter the odds, you will always win a challenge of will, regardless of your will nor your enemies will.,,
The Hunger - The Red-White Art,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Requires Red Arts and White Arts%%%%Red-White Art is a mixed art, more common in many uses than the pure White, but extremely rare and difficult in its most powerful uses. With this type of magic, you can transform people, such as turning your skin into iron, making kings babbling idiots, or transforming a warrior into a story tall monstrosity. At its peak, it can kill people, sometimes even entire armies, with a single word. People fear this art so much, that it is banned on some worlds.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You have found the power of the Black Arts; the act of creating something from nothing. As simple as it sounds, keep in mind all red arts require you to have matter available to mess with. It can also potentially kindle the Flame Immortal, allowing you to create souls from scratch.,,
The Outsider - Found in Madness,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,What's the big deal? You’ve seen some shit on your adventures across the planes of existence, so why should a world like this feel weird to you? You are hard to faze with simple weirdness, as you are used to it by now.,,
The Outsider - Friendly Face,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You naturally seem to get people to trust you, whether by your looks or mannerism, you come across as gentle and nurturing and friendly. Just be careful, there are some who view this as a weakness.,,
The Outsider - Inheritor,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sometimes, you gotta prepare the next generation for what's to come. You are skilled in the act of finding a good heir for your powers, and additionally you are good at grooming people to your specifications.,,
The Outsider - Self-Aware,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,We are all flawed, but YISUN likes it that way. Perfection is boring, and weakness defines us as much as our strengths. You must be a follower of YISUN, it seems, as you are aware of your strengths, your flaws, your everything. You know who you are, and that is a gift within itself.,,
The Outsider - Hidden from the Eyes of God-,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Sometimes, you have to hide. When hiding, you do so with surprising effectiveness, and you can stay hidden so long as no obvious clues are there to point in your direction.,,
The Outsider - The Crew of Jumper,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Friendship is important. Sometimes it's the only thing preventing us from going mad. Thankfully, you will never have to deal with loneliness. You seem to naturally attract “true companions”, people who you can trust and see as equals.,,
The Outsider - The Master of the Universe,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Sometimes, life isn’t fair. Sometimes, you gotta make your own way to what you want. When a power is hidden behind a wall that only those that are born a certain way or were blessed with potential, you can reach it just by searching for enlightenment. Let no one, not even the universe, change your path.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Even powers normally impossible to get, like powers that belong to a single person, can be gotten through enlightenment (though this does not work on fiat-blocked powers),,
The Outsider - I Choose King,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Many people hate themselves. They wallow in their failures, and they feel misery over how stuck they are. But there is a path, one that can lead them out. When you want to change, you will find that through some self-reflection and enlightenment, you can change in to the person you want to be.%%%%Additionally, so long as you like what you currently are, you will remain that way.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Not only can you change, but you can change the world around you. By improving yourself, the world improves, though it will never decrease in quality.,,
Human - Creativity,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,One of the things that sets humanity apart from the other races is that how creative they are. They create entire stories and worlds in their head. You embody this aspect. The thoughts you have, the worlds and stories you create, as so creative and vibrant they are lifelike.,,
Human - The Eternal Flame,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Humanity is flawed, as Aesma created them solely to have their own creation. But in this weakness, there is strength. You never give up, no matter what the multiverse throws at you. Maybe you can be so stubborn that even in the face of god, you can spit in it.,,
Human - The Conquering Jumper,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Humanity has a potential, one that differs them from the other races. A potential for power. There is a reason 5 out of the 7 Demiurges are human. So long as you seek power, you will find pathways into getting more.%%%%%%Boosted:%%The true king as come. You are a force of nature, capable of fighting every single prime angel in heaven, simultaneously alone, and you could win.,,
Servant - Smug Prick,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You’re an asshole, I hope you know that. You can spread your smugness into your surroundings, so everyone knows how better you are then them. Jerk.,,
Servant - A Reason for Existing,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,There is a reason you exist. Literally. Servants were created by Koss, the craftsman god, to help him around the Throne. You excel at one job, with the more specific the job the bigger the boost, and vice versa.,,
Servant - Grand Jumper,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Servants are immortal, and they can live so long as no one kills them. And some, like Mammon, grow with age. The longer you live, you grow smarter and wiser. You also never grow weaker from age, only stronger.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Not only do you grow wiser and smarter, but also physically. Your physical, and magic passively increase over time, and they increase at a faster rate than normal.,,
Devil - Distiller,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Devils love alcohol. They create all kinds of it. And you, Jumper, are an expertise at this. You can make the most delicious alcohol, and people would buy it for any price, so long as it isn’t overly outrageous.,,
Devil - Ebon Devil,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Considered some of the most dangerous beings in the universe, Ebon Devils are the oldest, and closest to their unbound form, as they can get. They are nightmares, with a now-extinguished Ebon Devil called Yaldacloath being able to steal a key from Mammon’s vault. You are one of these devils, and you gain boosts all around, but particularly in stealth, where you excel even among Ebon Devils. You also have a commanding aura, able to direct people lower on the social ladder than you, so long as they are a different species. Just try not to get too ambitious, as there will be consequences.,,
Devil - Pure Ego,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Himself isn’t the only one, it seems! By choosing this perk, you have become unbound from the Void. You have become separate from the rules of Reality, and the laws of Decay and Time. This means you no longer decay nor age over time, unless you want to, of course. On top of that, you can speak a language, one that not only hurts to hear, but can literally harm and cut through matter.%%%%Additionally, your power is boosted to the point where even 13 Ebon Devils would be needed to so much as threaten you.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You have become completely free of any and all restrictions. As a being second only to Himself, leader of Devil-kind. You are more of a force of nature than a living being, able to warp reality on a scale of a small city, and due to your abstract existence only supernatural attacks can harm you.,,
Angel - 26 Jumper Names Mark the Sky,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Angels tend to have flowery names, so why shouldn’t you? You may choose an overly flowery and long name, and people will call you that seriously.,,
Angel - Thorn Knight,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Thorn Knights, the servants of Metatron, are the most dangerous angels outside of Michael 2 and Metatron 1. They are equal to Ebon Devils, except in Speed and Stealth, where they excel in the former but lesser in the latter. On top of that, you will always be treated with respect wherever you go.%%%%You are also good at riding motorcycles and looking cool while doing so, for some reason.,,
Angel - Prime,,1,,-8000,,False,,True,,Looks like Michael is no longer alone. You are a reincarnated Prime Angel, one of the Angels that protected heaven after the gods died. You are strong, among the strongest beings in the multiverse, and you also have memories of the old days of being in the Throne before Zoss came, with some knowledge of the gods and what came before.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You are no longer a reincarnated prime angel, but instead one who survived Zoss’s onslaught. Your power is so great that you could slaughter the entirety of the Red City, minus the Demiurges, easily.,,
Common Sense,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You actually have some sanity, after all. You see through people’s lies, at least the less complex ones, and you know when you are being manipulated.,,
Mendicant,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,An order of beggar knights, the knights here are all poor, and are often just getting by in life. However, despite this, Mendicant knights are considered the most dangerous of the 4 orders.%%%%By trying to hide your true power, you become someone looked down upon, and enemies often underestimate you. This lasts until you stop hiding, of course, but isn’t it worth it to see the surprise on your enemy's face before you strike them down in a single stroke?,,
Peregrine,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,An order of explorers, this order explore the Wheel, and destroy any evil they see, and repair any shrine. You have had some of this power handed to you.%%%%By searching for something, events will conspire to have you find what you were looking for.,,
Bellergent,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,The order of Bloody Knights, the knights of this order are always searching for a good fight. They wander the roads, looking for someone (or something) to battle.%%%%By choosing this perk, you now have the tendency to find things that will always challenge you, regardless of your power. You will never be stuck at a certain point, just because nothing challenges you anymore.,,
Geas,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Knights of this order always have a single goal, one that differs between each knight. Some choose to help people, others to restore a king, and so on.%%%%By focusing on what you want to accomplish, nothing can change your mind from what you need to do. Whether it's torture, mental influence, or simple manipulation, your mind can simply not be changed from your goal.,,
Demiurge,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,There are currently 8 Demiurges in the entire multiverse: Allison, and the Seven. Well, it looks like there are now 9, with you getting in.%%%%This power manifests as a glowing white dot on your forehead. While it can be covered, it otherwise can’t be hidden or gotten rid of. At will, you may also manifest a halo above your head, and beyond having to look kinda like a halo, you get to choose how it looks.%%%%This power, access to the Key of Kings, grants you many abilities.%%%%First, you are able to do stuff like summon phantasms of gods to fight for you, have clones made up of white energy split from your body and attack your enemies, teleport, and more.%%%%Additionally, you know one of the words of the Seven Part Name, YISUN’s true name. By saying this word, you damage reality itself, and even killing those of weak will.%%%%Finally, you can also loan some of your power to your followers. How strong these powers you give them depends on how much power of your own you sacrifice, but these blessings can be pulled back to you at no cost, and making your power whole again.%%%%You can also make your Emissaries, the people who have been granted power by you, have their mind twisted to your goals, though those with strong will can fight against this, even defeat your corruption.%%%%The Key you get is equal to Allison’s / Zoss’s, though you have to learn how to use it.%%%%The downside to this power, is that anyone that sees your Key and knows what it is probably wants to steal it for themselves. And if it is taken out of your head, you fall unconscious and take a ton of damage and pain, regardless of any power you have.%%%%%%Post-jump, you may choose to hide the Key, revealing no outward signs of it.%%%%%%This perk is also a capstone booster.,,
The Sanctioned Action,,1,,-7000,,False,,True,,Is to cut. There is only one, maybe two people in the entire Multiverse that have the skill to cut. And it is much more than just cutting something with a sword. To Cut means division by the blade of Want, that parer of potentials that excises infinities. And by cutting, you cut not only the physical, but the universe itself.%%%%At the point where you start at, it is “merely” the ability to cut through anything not completely invincible.%%%%But by studying and growing the act of cutting, you will grow in Strength.%%%%At the end of the road for this, you will be able to cut anything, no matter how strong or durable or esoteric or abstract it is.%%%%Not only that, but you can cut people without so much as drawing your sword, and cut things just by touching them.%%%%You can also project a “laser” from the tip of your sword, and it cuts as well as you can.,,
49 Empty Palms,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Using your Atum, the fire that burns in every soul, you can turn your strikes into projectiles, allowing you to “hit” people from a distance. You can also use this power to do things like force a lever open, and other actions of that nature.,,
Vertigo Bullet,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You are good at using a ranged weapon, such as a gun or a bow, in close quarters. You can avoid attacks, reload, and aim all at the same time.,,
Pilgrim Fist,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Not a martial art in the strictest sense, you become much better at exploring places, and it is hard to get lost barring sabotage. You also seem to have an extensive amount of contacts for traveling; so while you might not get the strongest weapons available, you will still get what you need to survive when exploring.,,
Medicine Palm,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You are able to balance the Atum in others by touching them, allowing you to heal their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional wounds. You are also good at finding out how to help people heal, be it stopping a curse from killing them, to simply healing a broken bone.,,
Flying Snow,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You become light and agile, and you are able to fly for short periods of time, as it is tiring.,,
Demon Flips the Cart,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,By consuming twice the amount of sustenance that a member of your race usually does, you can hit people hard enough to launch them, sometimes even beyond sight. This actually doesn’t hurt them more than a regular attack would, but it's good for keeping people away.,,
Shivering Arrow,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You may purify some kind of physical ranged projectile, like a bullet or an arrow, and by using it in battle, the projectile never misses its target, even turning 90 degree angles and dodging obstacles to hit their target. Damaging them, however, isn’t a guarantee.,,
Pattram Sword Hand,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Using Atum, you can allow your unarmed attacks to act as if they were bladed, allowing you to cut into people. The sharpness of this blade depends on how strong you are, but even a regular human can treat their unarmed strikes as a steel sword. As a side effect, it is harder for you to break your own limbs in combat when hitting others.,,
Murderous Blade,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,A forbidden technique, this perk allows you to drain the Atum of others by hurting them physically, and steal their Atum for yourself. This allows you to heal from hurting others. A dark talent, for sure, but also a useful one.,,
Rider of the Endless Path,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You are a master at riding. When you need it, you may summon a mount of your choice (it is either a horse, or something that you own, like a hell motorcycle), and upon it, you are an expert at taking down others. You will almost never crash, and it is hard to hit you. Not to mention the fact of how satisfying it is to hit someone with a mace while riding a motorcycle. Your mount also grows more durable, at least half as durable as you.,,
Five Elements Internal Technique,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Using your Atum, you may attune to one of the following elements: Fire, Earth, Water, Wood, Metal. While resting for 8 hours or longer, you can choose one, and only one, of these elements. When the chosen element is used against you, you can expand the charge in order to completely ignore the attack, regardless of your strength. This ability does not stack, and can only be used once per rest.,,
Bearer of Legend,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Somehow, one of your weapons or even your body itself, has been infused with an ancient and potent power. While I’ll leave the nature of such power up to you, the power can be used to “charge” up whatever is imbued with the power, and the longer you charge, the more power it expels when used, and there is no limit to how much you can charge.,,
Diamond Soul,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It seems that, some time in the past, you studied a Shard of the Worldstone, a massive gem that was destroyed over 30,000 years ago. Through this studying, you have learned how to allow your body to take on Gem-like properties. When using this power, so long as you don’t move, you can’t be knocked back or down, and even a regular human who has this power would be as durable as a diamond, and this scales with how durable you are.,,
Howl of the Cursed,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,You have been cursed. Or was it a blessing? Regardless of the intent, you are now able to turn into a rampaging monsterous, warped, or bestial form. While in this form, all natural abilities (and I mean stuff like sharp claws and teeth, not genetic-based powers) are enhanced, to the point where your claws could cut through steel like it isn’t even there, and you can flip cars with one hand.,,
Twenty Five Purities Path,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Someone found the book, it seems. Having studied this book, you have gained a multitude of abilities. You are immune to all poisons and diseases, no matter the potency or nature. You are also immune to all attempts to change or alter your mind against your will.%%%%Additionally, by studying someone, you can see their weak points.,,
Head of John,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,For some reason, you have affixed 3 metal studs to your head. Don’t fret, these are actually useful. The left stud prevents your head from being decapitated, and it makes your head functionally indestructible (though this does not spread to the rest of your body), and you may survive a year and one day as just a head. Using the right stud, by focusing, you can read the general emotional state of the situation. The central stud allows you to fire a laser of ice, fire, energy, etc from the stud. You may choose what each stud is made out of, however it can’t be indestructible and you must have it either on you or in your warehouse.,,
Import,,3,,00,,False,,True,,You may freely import 8 of your friends for free, and with 400 CP, you can do this as much as possible. They each get 800 cp to spend, and get a background and race (though they still have to pay for Angel). Additionally, you can use this background for an OC companion.,,
Canon Companion,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,Want to destroy evil with White Chains? Or do you want to write fanfiction with Cio? Regardless, you can recruit a companion with this option, though you must convince them to join you on your adventures.,,
Cult of Jumper,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,Seems as if you have some followers. You now have a dedicated cult to you, one that will follow your every order. They change every jump, but they maintain the items you give to them, though different people hold them each jump.,,
Items,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Now that you have followers, and abilities need to survive, we are here, with a whole collection things you can buy. You can get a discount on 1 of each tier. Discounted 100s are free.,,
Meti’s Sword Manual,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A manual to the art of Cutting, by Meti. It attempts to convince the reader that violence is pointless and that they should become a farmer.,,
Signature Weapon,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A weapon made to your specifications, while it doesn’t have any supernatural abilities it is durable, needs to maintenance, and good at whatever it does. Over time, it also start to feature art of your adventures.,,
Iconic Clothing,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Clothing tailored to your specifications, it can look however you want, though it cannot be more protective than a set of plate armor. It also doesn’t need maintenance, repairs over time, and seems to avoid or minimize harm to itself, somehow.,,

They do no damage to your internal organs, and they can’t be broken or taken out of your body by anyone other than you. Really just decorations, but sometimes that matters.,,
Airship,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,An airship, nothing special about it other than it's the size of a galleon, rooms of everyone, cannons, and other stuff that warboats have, except this one is powered by an unbound devil engine, and it floats.,,
Slice of Red,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A warehouse addon, this addon resembles a 1x1 mile slice of a section of the city of your choosing. It is bustling with life of all kinds, though none can leave this addon.,,
Sin-Cycle,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,This motorcycle, if it could be called that, seems made out of torture equipment, with skeletons tied to it. Despite its looks, it can go up to 100 mph, ignores terrain (so long as it isn’t ridiculous), and doesn’t require fuel. Neat deal, huh?,,
Immortality Peach Tree,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A tree like Mottom’s eating the peach of this tree will de-age you, and eating them periodically will prevent you from aging. Unlike Mottom’s tree, it isn’t coming out a corpse, and it does not require the blood of virgins to live. It is in a small garden attached to your warehouse.,,
Prime Angel Shell,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,The shell of a long dead prime angel, this shell is now inhabited by Unbound Devils, this is commonly used as a war-machine, due to its size. The Shell can take a ludicrous amount of punishment, though it is slow in returning it.,,
Living Wood Arm,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A prosthetic limb made from wood of a living tree, this arm is much stronger than your other arm, and you can force energy through it, allowing it to manifest objects like a sword made from light.,,
Angel Armor,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,Armor made from multiple bodies of angels, it was then enhanced enough to put most armors to shame. It is strong enough to survive a drop off a mountain, a tank shot without flinching, and the collective force of an entire army. You can also import a set of armor, in order to get it these abilities. If you are an angel, then you may use this as your body.,,
Citadel,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Seven Demiurges each have their own base, such as Incubus’s tower or Jagganoth’s fortress. You now one of these.%%%%You may design your citadel in the Citadel Table.%%%%Post jump, It is either put somewhere in the world, or it is an attachment to the warehouse.,,
Guild,,2,,-6000,,False,,True,,You are the proud leader of a guild, the criminal syndicates that cross the multiverse. It is as large as the setting allows it, spanning from a world-spanning mega-corp, to a multiversal empire.,,

Multiple Limbs,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,You have more than 4 limbs, and you can choose how many you have. Just try not to go overboard.,,
Claws,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Somewhere on your body is a sharp set of claws, capable of cutting through flesh like it isn't even there. A good holdout weapon, but beyond that, though, it just looks cool.,,

Aesthetics,,2,,00,,False,,True,,You may choose how your Citadel looks. Whether it is a pagoda made of marble, a library full of books, or something else, you can make it.,,

Protection,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Every citadel needs some protection from invaders. For the 100 CP option, you have walls, some guards, and a gate. At 200 CP, you have thicker, reinforced walls, and the guards have guns comparable to a modern day military. For 300 CP, you have more guards, artillery, some high-technology vehicles like tanks, and a fleet of airships patrolling the area. If you have followers, they can replace the guards.,,
Mimic Nest,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A nest of Mimics, beings that, well, mimic inanimate objects. At least, until an enemy appears, in which case they come alive and try to eat the enemy. For some reason, they know when someone has your graces when coming in, so they don’t attack allies or followers. Mimics are also dumb, and a large number of the same object most of the time signifies their existence.,,
Traps,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,The basic thing to have in any dungeon, traps for those that aren’t wary. They can range anywhere from spikes and pits, to magical traps and cursed items. These traps also don’t trigger when an ally or follower of yours crosses them.,,
Luxury,,2,,00,,False,,True,,A less useful upgrade, but by buying this, you are allowed to make your citadel into a luxurious palace. You can get libraries, baths, gardens, bedrooms, and so on. And that is with the 100 CP option. With the 200 CP option, your luxury rooms are places of legend, in how advanced and comfortable they are.,,
Puzzles,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The citadel is full of puzzles, ones designed to trick and frustrate intruders. Followers can remember all the answers to it. With traps, you can have the traps activate if the puzzle was solved wrong. With maze, you can have some sections of the maze hidden behind puzzles.,,
Evershifting,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The citadel is not a static building. With effort, it can be changed. With a thought and some power, you can warp the entire internal structure of the building, making it hard to travel without getting lost.,,
Maze,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your citadel twists and turns, and unless the invaders have knowledge on where to go, more than likely get lost, and starve to death inside the maze. With Non-Euclidean, the maze is infinite in size, and some parts of it look and act lie Escher paintings. With Evershifting, the maze can change over time, making it much harder to find the exit.,,
Inner World,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,The core of your vault is less construction, and more natural. As in, the entire place resembles a terrain of your choice. With Follower Village, the village is somewhere here, and with Non-Euclidean, the inner world is practically infinite in size.,,
Follower Village,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Inside of your citadel, lies a whole village, with thousands of people in it. Whether they are cultists, soldiers, guards, or other things, they all live here, and would protect the citadel with their life. They also know their way around the place, so they will never get lost. That is the 300 CP option, at least. The 500 CP option is more comparable to a small city in terms of population, and every single one of your followers is a trained fighter. Not only are they deadly, but they also have High Technology, and are more than willing to use it on intruders.,,
Non-Euclidean,,2,,-3000,,False,,True,,The inside of your citadel does not obey the laws of physics. It is much larger inside than outside, maybe even infinite inside. Therefore, it is both much easier for intruders to get lost, and it also allows Followers, if you have them, to build even greater things inside of the citadel.,,
Vault of Gold,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,At the core of your vault, lies more money and gold then you can properly understand. Literal hills of gold coins, it all belongs to you. Try not to let it go to your head.,,
Flying,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Like a certain old hag’s palace, your citadel can float. It is mostly slow, but it is out of reach of those that seek to raid it, unless they have some way to enter a flying plane. Additionally, if you can teleport, you can teleport the entire structure with you.,,
Regrets,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,You have serious regrets about something in your life, and you have trouble taking your mind off it. Suffice to say, it is gonna make you do some stupid things.,,

Targets,,4,,00,,False,,False,,It seems you have attracted the attention of some of the more evil entities of the Wheel. They are all forces to be reckoned with, and they should not be taken lightly. You may choose as many as you want, and you get +200 CP for each enemy you take. You don’t have to kill them, but should they die they won’t come back. If taken more than one, they will work together to take you down.%%%%The Tyrant - A warlord, this person has carved his own section of the Throne through power, and his army. He seems to find you as the only person to threaten him, due to your abnormal amount of power, and thus, you must die. He will send assassins at first, each looking to stab you in the back, but if those fail he will just start to send soldiers to battle you. He is rumored to have a castle somewhere in the shades, one very well defended, so taking him down is gonna be no easy task.%%%%The Broker - A master manipulator, they have played a game that ruins or ends lives, just for their own satisfaction and enjoyment. And now, you have appeared, and they see you as the other player in their twisted game. They will manipulate events and conspire against you, all to make you a target of whatever cruel things at her disposal. They are said to be a high-ranking official in the throne, and their identity is hidden, so you will have to find them on your own.%%%%The Cult - More of a group of people than a single person, they have infiltrated almost everywhere, from the top of heaven to the bottom of hell. They recruit the downtrodden, who are searching for another way out, to nobles, searching for more power. Regardless, they see you as the sacrifice that will bring their dark god into the world. Be careful, they have eyes everywhere.%%%%The Wrecking Ball - A being of pure brutality, they destroy everything in their path. Be it a gang, an army, an angel, it doesn’t matter, it is all so fragile before them. They wield weapons capable of blowing buildings down, and their hide is stronger than even the strongest steel. And, Jumper, they have set their sights on you, the only person capable of challenging them. While blunt in their tactics, they won’t stop until one of you is died.%%%%The Monstrosity - A true abomination, it is unknown how they came into being. Maybe they were warped by magic, or a deformation, or something else. The point is, they barely resemble a human, more of a beast, and you have become their newest target. They might act alone, but their skills and weapons are unknown, as anyone who was marked as a target to them was dead before they got a good look at them.%%%%The Gang - Again, more of a group than a single entity, Gangs are ever present in the Throne. For some reason or another, you have disrespected them, and now they are out to restore their dignity, by any way possible.

Lost,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,Choose one of the seven deadly sins. You now embody the inverse of it.

Save 1 Friend,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,One of your closest friends was kidnapped, and now you have the intense urge to find them.

Journey Below,,5,,00,,False,,True,,It is rumored that below the city, on the underside of the throne, lies a hidden fortress. It is rumored that within this fortress, a long-dead demiurge stocked up on weaponry he found across the multiverse. It is said that there are things like devil-powered armor, vehicles that stand on two legs, and more.%%%%And soon, the Fortress will be raided.%%%%An Ebon Devil has been looking for those willing to help him raid the vault, and he has hired many different recruits, potentially including you. However, there is one thing you must know: they will betray you. This isn’t a secret; in fact, most people know that any group like this is bound to have competition and slaughter among them. The list of those among the party are:%%%%Oz'gar, the Mastermind- an Ebon Devil, they have been searching for this vault and gathering information about it for years. Having finalized their plan, they started recruiting people. Be careful, though, as he will do anything to take all the treasure for himself.%%%%17 Cold Storm Purges the Truthful, the Bruiser- a rogue Angel, they have made a reputation for themselves among the red city as a fierce mercenary, even among angels. They are four armed, covered in spikes, and is practically carrying an entire armory. They are more than willing to sacrifice everyone else to advance their own agenda, though%%%%Vorgon, the Face- a Gold Devil, they are smart, charismatic, and most importantly, brutal. Able to twist most people around their finger, and is more than willing to use this on the party, they believe they are better and more deserving than others. Be careful around them.%%%%Ozzan, the Mechanic- A Red Devil, they are a mastermind of technology, even the rare High technology. They always carry around tools, to be sure they won’t get trapped. They are also the master of bombs: being able to make them with even the worst tools and materials. It is no wonder that they are of use to the party%%%%Kalgren, the Acrobat- a Green Devil, they are the grease monkey of the party. They stalk from the shadows, looking to kill whoever threatens them. Silent, but always watching, waiting for a moment to cause an “accident”.%%%%Jumper, the Wildcard- That’s you. You may bring 2, and only 2, of your companions on this journey with you.%%%%The first step on the mission is to go down to the Shades. The Shades are the poorest part of the city, stuck in darkness due to the Throne’s sun no longer working. Within this place lie some of the deadliest criminals. The furthest that the Shades is known to go down to is 18 stories down, however there are rumors it goes even deeper than that. You must work with your party in order to find how to access the lowest parts of the city. Be careful, for slavers and gangsters are around, and they are more than willing to kill you or worse.%%%%Survive long enough, and you are bound to find the tunnels, which cross the underside of the entire Red City, though little know they actually exist. The tunnels are a labyrinth, however, and you must keep a keen eye as to not get lost. The tunnels aren’t empty, either. There are something living in the darkness, waiting for prey to show up.%%%%Eventually, assuming you don’t die, You will find the entrance to the Fortress. The fortress, from the looks of it, is worn down and harmless, but appearances are deceiving. The entrance of the fortress is full of traps, from simple spikes coming out of the floor, to more complex and magical traps like Devil-bound engines of destruction. On top of that, there are also many mimics within this part, looking like treasure or items of comfort, or sometimes even basic stuff like chests and chairs, or even floor tiles.%%%%As you make it through this, you have finished the first trial. Now, you must do the second. The second trial is simple, but hard: Avoid the Devil-bound engines. These engines are like dogs in how they look, except they are made out of a red metal, with holy words inscribed all over them. These engines are durable enough to put some ancient angels to shame. The best idea for this one, is to avoid them. The room they are in is a garden of sorts, except all the garden is made out of strange blood-red vines and plants, all with a fleshy texture. The plants in here are also dangerous. Some shoot out seeds that are shaped like bullets at sonic speeds, some have razor sharp vines they can whip at people, and others simply explode into a cloud of acidic poison that slowly erodes everything in the blast area, and even more. The room itself is a tunnel, albeit a massive one, and you must make it to the other end alive.%%%%Finally, you made it to the inside of the Fortress proper. The place is dusty, and seemingly unprotected, but that is wrong. The place, like the first trial, is full of traps, and even deadlier ones. There are also automatons here, powered by a dark science, and they wander the fortress looking for trespassers. Killing one won’t work, as it would send a signal to the rest of the automatons, and they will all know there is an intruder and look even harder. You must find the vault, where the treasure is hidden.%%%%The vault itself is an extremely complex puzzle. It does have a secret, though. By sacrificing a sentient being on a circle in the middle of the floor, their blood will make it so that the vault is open. Inside the vault, lies what you were waiting for.%%%%However, at this point, regardless of who made it or who survived up to this point, your “allies” will turn on you, seeking the treasure for themselves. You (and possibly your companions) must kill all the remaining party members. Then, the treasure shall be all yours.%%%%%%However, since the vault was opened by someone that wasn’t the long-dead Demiurge, the magical generator of the place starts to overload, and it would eventually explode, taking the fortress with it. You only have time to take one of the following treasures.%%%%Devil Engine - This golden suit of armor is a rare, ancient, and powerful version of Power Armor. Because of their rarity, even the weakest suits of power armor sell for tons. This one, however, is no ordinary power armor. For one, it can shapeshift itself to your specifications, and it is powered by an unbound devil, augmenting your strength at least half over, just by putting it on. In terms of durability, the armor could take on high-ranking angels and leave with only scratches.%%%%Davy Crockett - This strange launcher was found on a dead earth, during the second conquest. It is a tube, with wires in and out, and it does not need to reload. The launcher fires a green orb, and upon impact, it explodes with the force of a nuke, however after 40 feet it grows dramatically weaker, with everything past 50 feet of the explosion unaffected, and the launcher does not leave radiation behind. The explosion also causes all magic and technology within 20 feet to turn off, making it useful against Sorcerers of the Arts.%%%%God-bone Sword - a sword made from the bones of Sivran, god of conquest. It appears to be a long sword made of jagged bone, and the hilt has leather wrapped around it. The sword itself can cut through stone, steel, and even Angel Shells. However, the main purpose of the sword is it damages not only the body, but also the Atum and soul, meaning it can kill things for good, even Angels and Devils. Additionally, the user is filled with the power of the God of Conquest, making them a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.%%%%Hammer of Koss - a hammer with the head resembling a Dragon’s head with an orb in its mouth, the orb is actually a polished fragment of the Craftsman Koss’s hammer. When using this hammer in a forge, the items you create are much better than what they should be. When used in battle, however, the hammer allows you to change people hit by it, so long as they are weaker than the wielder of the hammer.%%%%Crown of the Conquering King - A jagged crown of corroded iron, this ‘crown’ was made for Zoss, though Zoss turned down the need for a throne. When wearing it, you can manifest objects of a bright white light in your hand. These objects are much better versions of what they were designed after, like a sword made with this being much better than regular steel sword. These manifestations can be summoned and dismissed with a thought.%%%%Dread Sorcerer’s Book - A book written by a sorcerer's Demiurge, this book is one of a kind. It looks just like any regular journal, with a pure black leather cover. However, inside of the book, there are in infinite amount of pages, each with ever-changing guides to magic. It features testing of the Art, forbidden and forgotten techniques, and more. The book also grows with each universe it goes to, though it will never contain one of a kind or rare spells, only common ones in foreign settings. The book also opens up to whatever page you want it to.%%%%Void-Cycle - This treasure is a pure white motorcycle with gold accents, and it looks like a dragon. It can drive itself, move on almost any solid terrain, and it is durable to the point of ridiculousness. It can go up to 200 mph, and due to the magic used to forge it, will never hurt the user either directly or indirectly. The Motorcycle is powered by a sorcerous engine, and will never run out of fuel.%%%%As soon as you choose your treasure, a portal opens in the center of the vault, and you can use it to escape, reappearing somewhere in the Shades. Next time you go to your warehouse, you also find a new door, one that leads to mountain of gold coins. They replenish over time, though slowly, and it is more than enough to destroy the price of gold in today’s market, so be careful with it.,,
