Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You’re something strange, aren’t you? A foreigner, less connected to this world than any other. Wanderers such as yourself are commonplace in Hallownest, although their life expectancy is usually quite low.,,
Scholar,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You studied Hallownest from afar, or perhaps have returned to it, memories fuzzy but pertinent. You seek to learn all you can about this kingdom, and to learn its secrets simply for the sake of knowledge, and perhaps to make sure it’s wonders could be used where they are better needed.,,
Shopkeep,,0,,00,,False,,False,,With all these travellers coming in, somebody has to supply them. Weapons, shields, food, tools, even a good place to sleep. And you’re here to fill that role, selling your services for Geo or barter. It takes a certain kind of shrewdness to be a proper keeper of goods and services, but you’re ready for it, and the flow of money that might come in through your door.,,
Nailmaster,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Nail is an incredibly versatile weapon, utilized by many across the world. Its forms countless, its styles innumerable. And some devote themselves to the Nail, aiming to master it not just as a style of fighting, but as a true artform. And what better place to hone one’s Nail than a dangerous ruin such as Hallownest?,,
Dreamseer,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Dreams are intrinsically connected to reality, and to people. One’s dreams can bleed into the material, thoughts and feelings echoing out, and Dreamseers are among the few to use this. Most Dreamseers died with the near extinction of the Moth Tribe, but some still can see through the veil and use it for good or ill will alike. Hallownest still dreams, even in stasis, a perfect place for one seeking to advance that art.,,
Mosskin,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Among those worshipped in the area around Hallownest, there are few as revered as Unn, besides the Wyrm King himself. The lord of Moss, their mere thoughts brought life to the caves, forming the verdant lands of Greenpath, along with its denizens, the Mosskin. Such beings are deeply attuned to nature and utilize it against those who might invade their lands.,,
Troupe Member,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Where there are followers of dreams, so too are there those of nightmares. Spoken of only in hushed whispers, the followers of the Grimm Troupe are widespread, even if they are not part of the group itself. Utilizers of the darker forms of dream manipulation, and anything that draws a Dreamseer is bound to do the same for those of the Troupe.,,
Godseeker,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Godseekers are foreign, thrust out from a now godless land. They seek one to follow, a God of Gods, one to give all their focus, to ascend them into something greater. Hallownest still possesses the lingering beacon of the Wyrm King, a shining pale point which attracts their kind, as did it you.,,
Voidtouched,,0,,00,,False,,False,,The Void found you in some way. Perhaps you were born of it, perhaps infused with it. Maybe it simply bonded with you on accident. But regardless, you are changed, different, empty. Deep within Hallownest, you can feel it call to you, and you have answered.,,
Paleborn,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Perhaps it was destiny that brought you back here. Perhaps it is out of obligation, or just simple irony. You are a child of the Pale King. Whether done out of a deal or something else, your blood holds power beyond belief. As to whether you harness it fully is up to you.,,
SOUL,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Soul. The truest expression of one’s self, the energy said to permeate almost all life and which animates the bodies of bugs. Many have theories and observations on it, but only a few can truly wield it. You shall be one of those.%%%%It can be used for countless things once one knows the applications, and can be harvested from others whether through physical force or harvest of essence with specialized tools.%%%%On its own, this doesn’t do much, but once one learns how to tap into it, its potential is nearly unlimited.,,
Body of a Bug,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Grants you the body and basic attributes of one of the bugs of Hallownest, customizable as you wish within reason, able to become any kind of insect you can imagine, with the upsides such a thing may provide, be it wallwalking or flight.,,
Melodies of Hollownest,,1,,00,,False,,True,,You gain the OST to Hollow Knight, toggleable at will and fitting to the situation at hand.%%%%Perhaps new tracks in Christopher Larkin’s style may appear as well from time to time.,,
Hardiness of a Bug,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Bugs are a hardy sort, with their chitinous exteriors and long lifespans. But of most note is their powerful legs and resilience to falls. A flea, while one of the smallest, can jump its height countless times over and land perfectly safe. Something you too can do as well.%%%%Long falls are perfectly safe for your person, no matter the height. Don’t go thinking you can drop from atmosphere without protection, though, this doesn’t protect against being burned to a crisp.,,
Eternal,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,A few bugs can be especially hardy to the passage of time, a thousand years may go by, yet they seem almost exactly the same. A longevity coveted by some, and loathed by others. This is a trait you now share.%%%%You practically cease to age, to the point where a thousand years may only age you a single biological year, in addition, your physical needs are half of what they normally are.%%%%Of course you aren’t immune to being stabbed or disintegrated, but left alone, you could outlive nearly everyone you know, and perhaps even the civilization around you.,,
Voidheart,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,A very special charm, even if a replica of the true thing. Forged of Wyrm and Root and baptized by Void.%%%%Its effects aren’t immediately apparent even as it fuses with your very body. But Void is that of raw potential. And potential is what it brings.%%%%%%Capstone booster,,
Salubra's Blessing,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Courtesy of a rather messy kiss, you are granted the blessing of Salubra.%%%%With this, whenever you rest anywhere, be it sleeping or simply taking a break on a bench, you rapidly regain SOUL alongside any other kind of magical resource.,,
Drop In - No Pleasure,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,To the world, you are nothing more than a small, insignificant entity. A waste of life, a worthless specimen. Creatures might glance over you thinking you aren’t worth the time to hunt. Warriors might heavily underestimate you, and scholars might think you a complete idiot.%%%%Which will make it all the better when you show them your true worth.,,
Drop In - A Most Irritating Prescence,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You know just the words to send practically anybody into a frothing rage. A simple insult here, a jab there, and you can blind the enemy with anger enough to incite recklessness.,,
Drop In - Unfathomable Luck,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Fate itself seems to twist around to grant you a boon, or save you from a worse fate. A wanderer might find and help you with a powerful monster, a guard might drop the key to your cell, hits that might graze simply slide by, and so on.%%%%Luck is fickle though, and overreliance on such a thing will surely be your end.,,
Drop In - Grey Knight,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You are wholly and utterly unpredictable. Your moves erratic, your attacks so completely off-kilter that it somehow loops back around into something actually effective.%%%%You cannot be predicted in any manner, whether by machine or instinct.%%%%In addition, your size and weight has increased to the point where simply impacting the ground can release radial shockwaves that can damage foes.%%%%Show them that clumsiness and unpredictability can be just as strong as proper training and clout.%%%%%%You do not need to actually flail around like an idiot or look clumsy for this to work. But it would make your victories all the more hilarious.%%%%%%Boosted:%%The Void that has seeped into your being grants you the gift of companionship, if temporary. You can now conjure or even spit out a series of Void-based constructs in your image, limited in power, but numerous and versatile. Simple creatures which fly, bite and hop at enemies, flying bombs which promptly explode soon after creation or if attacked, flying specters which drain SOUL or other magical resources from enemies, or even calling down a great visage of your face to crush them underneath your graven image.,,
Scholar - Analytical Mind,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your mind is like a steel trap, well crafted, and holds whatever it catches. You now have a near eidetic memory, capable of remembering things for hundreds, if not thousands of years without forgetting a minute detail.%%%%No thread shall hang loose, no step misstepped.,,
Scholar - Lord of Lumaflies,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Lumaflies are a curious bug, one used extensively in the works of Hallownest, with their natural glow, and more notably, their ability to generate, store, and discharge electricity. Many constructs within Hallownest are powered by these little bugs, from the lampposts all around the kingdom, to even the great trams and lifts make use of them in some way or another.%%%%And you’ve learned how to utilize these yourself, utilizing SOUL-synthesized pheromones to be able to control whole swarms of these creatures with ease.,,
Scholar - A Seal for Diversity,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,One of the most potent magical constructs created within Hallownest are the Seals of the Weaver tribe.%%%%These magical locks are nigh impervious to damage, their breadth and power scaling upward with both intricacy of the Seal, it’s size, and the amount of SOUL utilized in their construction.%%%%Their usage is twofold, whether to seal something inside, or to preserve something. A small seal affixed to a a weapon or armor is more than enough to make it practically unbreakable, while a large seal around a building can not only make a perfect prison, but also a way to preserve it, things and people left inside becoming unaging.%%%%In addition, this talent for Seals also allows you to create Masks capable of uplifting a creature to sentience, but at the cost of the creature’s original memories and mind.,,
Scholar - Craft of Void,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Void is a fickle, dangerous substance. Its mere presence can taint the air, but the potential within it is very much worth the risk, as the Pale King knew, and now you as well.%%%%You have learned the art of harnessing and creating life from Void, forming servants in molds and shells, able to reform on a whim upon defeat, and serving you to the bitter end.%%%%These constructs are often bound and clad in heavy steel armor and are more than intelligent enough to follow any order you give them, and if not, then they can learn.%%%%%%Without the booster, the Vessels don’t really possess much in the way of intelligence or personality beyond survival instincts, so don’t think you’re actually killing a real creature by body snatching it. Vessels can be made with sufficient amounts of biological matter for a small child alongside the flames and a bit of SOUL. Vessels do not possess any of your perks or other powers until entered by yourself.%%%%%%Boosted:%%The Void has whispered in your ear, supplanting improvements to your Moulds. Using SOUL as a conduit, you can grant your Moulds a weaker version of one of your perks, at around 50% of it’s normal strength. You can choose the perk at creation, but it cannot be changed afterwards.,,
Shopkeep - Calculating Mind,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Numbers, locales, tabs, finances. The cornerstones of business. So much to run, so much to think about to allow your business to flourish. Every asset must be accounted for, every sale perfectly sliced.%%%%You have the mind for this kind of thinking, the ability to multitask near flawlessly, to always be able to step back and think about things in logical, efficient manners, and to exploit customers just under their noses. But such a savvy businessman like you won’t need that last bit, will you?,,
Shopkeep - Cut Corners,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Sometimes you need to spend money to make money, and you’ve proven very, very efficient at doing such.%%%%Firstly, you are quite good at haggling prices, be it your own or for purchasing that of others.%%%%Secondly is your ability to cut corners in resource costs without harming the quality of your product. Subpar iron might be just as good as high quality ore, welding could be substituted with superglue, and so on. While this might make you look a bit like a cheapskate, you can’t argue with the results.%%%%This works on normal items you craft, and does not work for replacing magical or mystical materials.,,
Shopkeep - Way of the Smith,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,There’s a killing in the smithing business. Good smiths are hard to come by, especially in the ruin of Hallownest. Good thing you’ve become a master craftsman, then. Forging high-quality armor and nails comes as easy as breathing.%%%%Working new, unfamiliar metals and materials into your craft comes with great ease and figuring out new, efficient designs for things you work on is natural.,,
Shopkeep - Memento of the Soul,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Now this is an interesting talent you’ve learned. And a very, very profitable one. You have learned some of the methods behind the creation of Charms. Charms are often formed from the coalescence of the SOUL of a deceased, refined into a trinket.%%%%These trinkets can give small powers, larger charms granting more, smaller granting less. These can range from simply moving faster and hitting harder to very unique abilities. By harvesting the SOUL of another, you’ve learned to infuse it into a base, empty charm. The more you put in, the more power the charm possesses, but the more slots it takes up. What you get depends on what you put in.%%%%For instance, infusing the SOUL of a flying bug might be able to lower your weight, or grant the ability to glide. It will never give you the whole of an ability, only a facsimile.%%%%%%Alright, big note time. I’m going to lay out the specifics of Charm creation here as a guideline, since that perk was getting really big. Like stated, Charm Power ranges with size and SOUL put in, going from 1-5 Notches. These charms are usually connected to people in some way, granting the user some measure of additional power sourced from the originator. As an example for what each tier could do, let’s just use an example character. For this, i’ll just use Spiderman, since it’s a decent example character here. Also, bug powers.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Your power at manipulating the SOULs of others into trinkets of power is quite versatile. The Void offers a chance to find new sources of power, though. Power from within. Allows you to create Charms from your own SOUL, forming them into Charms resembling some of your capabilities. In addition, you have figured out the secrets behind the creation of Charm Notches, and have increased your personal maximum to 16. The same rules apply, and further info can be found below in the “Memento of the Soul” section of notes.,,
Nailmaster - Practice Makes Perfect,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,It’s true. Practice is the only way to keep up, to continuously hone your skill to a fine point. And you’re very good at analyzing it.%%%%You can essentially look back on moments in time, watch yourself, and note each and every flaw committed, by you or another.%%%%Through this, you have learned fluidity within your body, able to retrain instincts in but a few mere moments. Let it be known that you are nothing if not flexible.,,
Nailmaster - Honed Art,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,You have studied old tomes and consulted old master rigorously, and learned the techniques known as Nail Arts. Nail Arts are unique attacks, wielded by focusing deeply for a moment before unleashing one of several types of powerful blows with a Nail or other melee weapon.%%%%The Cyclone Spin causes a rapid twirling motion, turning you and your nail into a dervish of death for a couple moments, quick enough to even be able to generate lift into the air.%%%%The Dash Slash surges you forward before delivering a great piercing blow, capable of crumpling armor and chitin with ease.%%%%The Great Slash takes a similar concept, but sacrificing a little power for an immense increase in width, allowing one to carve through a horde in a single movement of your blade.,,
Nailmaster - Inner Power,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,SOUL is a power present in all beings, and you have learned to draw it out to unleash true power.%%%%You have learned how to channel SOUL into your blade, enhancing its strikes greatly, though each swing takes 5% of your SOUL pool.%%%%Nail Arts used while this state is active are greatly increased in power and scope, SOUL lashing out from your blade to cover the additional distance.,,
Nailmaster - Great Nailsage,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have trained, honed you and your nail to perfection. In your hands, a weapon is merely an extension of your will. You know its every trait, its every imperfection, and can utilize them to your advantage with merely a touch. The few who might be able to match you in swordplay are next to none.%%%%In addition, your speed and motions in combat are near imperceivably fast. You could swing a blade twice your size as if it were light as air, and your movements are incredibly hard to follow, almost as if you were teleporting from point to point.%%%%%%Boosted:%%You are fast, a blur to all. The Void allows you to capitalize on this, and show you that nothing can stop you. Allows the user to sheath themselves and their equipment in a veil of shadow, allowing the user to pass through solid substances at will. Donning the veil drains SOUL, and if within a surface when it fades will force you out in the nearest direction. Phasing through an enemy can cause internal damage and can allow you to completely ignore armor.,,
Dreamseer - Warded Mind,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Dreams are not just fantasy. They are gateways, peering into another realm. And just as a mind can enter this realm through dreams, so too can the opposite occur, other parties invading your own mind, supplanting their own wants and thoughts into yours. No longer.%%%%Your mind is an impregnable fortress to attempts to pierce into it, be it through the realm of dreams or other more direct approaches.,,
Dreamseer - Weapon of Mind,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Through practice, weaving of SOUL, and sheer focus, you have learned how to manifest a Dream Nail from your very hands. This long spike of energy does not reap flesh, rather it allows access to the minds and SOUL of others.%%%%Simply swinging it at another will reveal their current thoughts and slice a small portion of excess SOUL from their person, refilling your own pool by 25% per swing. However, if done on an unconscious or restrained foe, you can utilize it to enter their mind via the realm of Dreams.%%%%Within, you could see every last one of their memories and even use it as a conduit to enter the Dream Realm on it’s own, for all minds are connected to the realm at large, whether they know it or not.%%%%Some minds may be warded against entry, but by harvesting Dream Essence by entering the minds of powerful beings and defeating them within their own mind, you can eventually “unlock” your blade, allowing it to pierce any ward of mind and reveal their truest thoughts.%%%%%%Alright, some points on the Dream Nail I didn’t cover or specifics. One, once the Dream Nail is conjured, there’s no charge time to swing it like the regular. Secondly, for what as a “powerful being” differs from jump to jump. Generally consider it like powerful people, commanders of armies, apex predators, dark lords, that sort of thing. The amount of these you need to defeat scales with how powerful they are. For instance, a simple military commander might only add a bit of progress, but defeating a god would add a ton to this. Another note is you can still fight these dream versions even if the target is dead in the real world.,,
Dreamseer - Manifestation of Will,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Spirits exist in this world, bound to it because of past desires, or even a lack of realization of their own demise. While they may be spirits, they can interact with the world almost as much as a normal person can, capable of manifesting objects and weaponry out of Dream Essence to aid them in combat against those who might defile their graves. You’ve learned to do similar, with practice.%%%%By honing the image in your mind and manifesting SOUL, you can create phantasmal weaponry and armor, just as durable as the real thing. One can utilize these blades via a telekinesis-like effect, hurtling them towards enemies like spears. Each takes SOUL to use, and armor requires a channel of SOUL to continue existence.%%%%%%The weapons you can summon are basic weaponry, nothing overly fancy or mastercrafted. It’s a matter of quantity over quality. Armor scales upward with what you have access to, though, but the phantasmal armor does not have special properties beyond it’s durability.,,
Dreamseer - Melder of Dreams,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Your inner strength has blossomed, and your manipulation of the realm of Dreams is second only to several Higher Beings.%%%%Within a dream realm, your power, your magic, everything you do is enhanced greatly. However, of more note is your manipulation of these realms.%%%%You’ve learned how to influence others through dreams, coercing them, giving them suggestions, even direct mind control if done for long enough. Expending SOUL can speed up this process.%%%%%%Yes, this is essentially the Radiance’s form of mind control, sans the mutation and hive mind stuff. Though if you have the booster and Breadth of Mind, you could replicate the Infection perfectly, if that’s what you so desire.%%%%%%Boosted:%%The Void enhances your potency, and realizes some of your power into reality. Using SOUL, you can access your bolstered form even outside of a dream world, though this drains your pool quite rapidly. You can also force small changes to occur as well. Forging a small bridge to cross a chasm, making a solid steel door where once there wasn’t, even forming real weaponry into your hands on a whim. This can also be used as a form of storage for personal items, allowing you to whisk things away to your own dream world and pulling them back into reality when required.,,
Mosskin - Patience,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Mosskin, especially those amongst their warriors are known for it, an endless patience, waiting for days on end for an intruder to appear in their sights, and to ambush them when they do.%%%%You can wait nigh endlessly, and stay perfectly still for days at a time.,,
Mosskin - One with the Earth,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your body has grown a soft, mossy coating, one which can shift with the environment around it to blend in. Going to the Fungal Waste might see it turn brown, with mushrooms sprouting from all angles. Going to the City may see it turn dark and metallic, shimmering just like the metal corridors around you. Settling down in a spot might make you near undetectable with vision alone with this coating’s aid.%%%%While the coating cannot be completely removed, one can shrink it down to near unnoticeable levels, such as a small tuft of moss around the neck, or a flower on one’s head.%%%%%%If the coating is damaged or destroyed in some manner, it will eventually grow back.,,
Mosskin - Will of the Grove,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,It is said that Unn’s will can be seen through every leaf and vine they’ve created, and if they willed it, can be exerted upon as well. You’ve managed to replicate this trait through utilization of SOUL.%%%%By channelling SOUL, you’ve learned how to manipulate and shape plantlife, as well as allow it to grow symbiotically with yourself. Form walls of ivy and thorns, use vines as potent SOUL-charged whips, place SOUL within a plant to use it as a second set of eyes, use plants grown on one’s body as extra appendages or utilize them for photosynthesis, and so on.,,
Mosskin - Herald of Unn,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Unn thought, and the Greenpath bloomed into existence. Once barren caverns turned into lush greenery teeming with life. But Unn’s power fades. The call of the Mosskin for their creator falls on deaf ears, and they wilt. No longer. You have been granted a measure of the great Unn’s power, the ability to simply will plantlife into existence with naught but thought and a bit of SOUL.%%%%You may choose whatever kind of plants you desire to grow, be they simple moss or ivy, to massive trees and great fields of fruit and vegetable alike. You can even choose their colouration, or deem them to shift colours according to season or time of day.%%%%Let life grow in your presence, and may the world bloom with everlasting life.%%%%%%Boosted:%%The Void is ever malleable, and when combined with the power of life, one can truly embody the great spirit of the Greenpath.%%%%With larger exertion of SOUL, you can now form and create Mosskin within your mind and realize them into the real world. Mosskin are very similar to other kinds of bugs, distinguished by their mossy coating and loyalty to their creator. You can shape them as you please, and although their mossy exterior is required, it can be shaped however you wish.%%%%They can be anywhere between half the size of a person to thrice one’s height and width, the larger the size, the more SOUL is required. They can also possess the same kind of physical abilities bugs can, such as walking on sheer surfaces and ceilings, or true flight, among other things.,,
Troupe Follower - A Performance to Remember,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Even if you’re not a proper part of the Troupe and merely a follower, all within know something about performance. Making a good show is the purpose of a Troupe, after all.%%%%Choose a performance act, whether it be acts of acrobatics, animal taming, or any other sort of similar act. You are now very proficient at performing it and knowledgeable on it in general.,,
Troupe Follower - Allure of the Heart,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,What is an act without a showman? The one to draw people in, to capture their attention and have them hanging on every word.%%%%By tapping into SOUL, you’ve proven quite good at this act, capable of using it to grant a near irresistible quality to your words, perfect for a show, drawing attention, or perhaps recruiting new members...,,
Troupe Follower - Flame in Dream,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,If Dreams are soft and calming, then Nightmares are intense and raging. This is most reflected in the Troupe’s unique forms of sorcery, a form of pyromancy utilizing a mixture of SOUL and the Nightmare Essence which lingers within themselves. And now, you can do much the same.%%%%With just a bit of SOUL, you can conjure fireballs from your hands, erupt great pillars of scarlet flame underneath your foes, leave great trails of fire in your wake, and so on.,,
Troupe Follower - Born Anew,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The Grimm Troupe’s goals are simple. Maintain the Nightmare Heart through rituals of succession. The act of reincarnation, transferring its essence from host to host. This interests you very much, and after much experimentation and the deaths of more than a few non-sentient bugs, you’ve cracked your own version of this and figured out how to create a suitable body for it at that.%%%%Within fallen kingdoms, one can find Flames, the Flames of a kingdom’s fall. These Flames contain the memories of the kingdom, and can serve as ample fuel for your ritual. By collecting a number of these flames and creating a suitable vessel for them, you’ve skipped a few steps and have essentially created a living phylactery. If you die, your essence will be transferred to the vessel, and you live once again. It might take a little time for your new body to grow back to its full size, but surely that’s worth the cost of cheating death?%%%%Not to mention, as long as kingdoms fall, there will always be Flames to take.%%%%%%Boosted:%%The void’s insight has allowed you further experimentation with Flames, and further refined the ritual of reincarnation. You have found a way to consume the Flames yourself. While this renders them useless for the ritual, doing this can grant large amounts of information about the area as well as a notable, stacking boost in power in regards to Pyromancies.%%%%Flames burn brighter, longer, and larger with each you consume. A small boost, but with many flames, your power over fire could grow immensely. Of more note is of the ritual, which you have streamlined. No longer will you need to wait for the vessel to grow, as it will do so on its own before entering it. If left for long enough, you can simply walk in your new body as if it never changed. In addition, the vessels can be repurposed as servants with their own personalities and a proficiency with pyromancies. Filing them with flame can grant the same boons as if you had.,,
Godseekr - Attunement,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your focus and hunt for suitable beings to worship has allowed you to quickly size up potential Gods, and make sure you never glance over what should be attuned.%%%%At a glance, you can see the capabilities, accomplishments, and dispositions of others. No God of Gods will sneak pass your vision.,,
Godseeker - Thunder and Rain,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,The Godseekers once prayed to another set of Gods once, those of the Land of Storms. They fell, but a small imprint of them remains within yourself, for the link between God and Follower is mighty indeed.%%%%By bringing out SOUL, you can cause deafeningly loud thunderclaps with merely a collision of your appendages, and by emptying your pool of SOUL, you can conjure a great thunderstorm to pelt foes with harsh, heavy rain.%%%%%%As a note, you are immune to being deafened from your own thunderclaps. Your companions and others allies are not.,,
Godseeker - Breadth of an Ocean,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,The Godseekers faded into obscurity, many believing their end had come. But they survived by consolidating themselves, countless sacrificing their physical bodies and entering a single body, a host of followers all held within a single mind.%%%%You share this trait, the ability to consolidate minds into a single form, but if this is too intrusive, then you may instead opt for a linking of minds, a legion able to act and focus as one.,,
Godseeker - Ascension,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,The true purpose of a Godseeker is as servant, to bolster the gods they serve with their complete and utter focusing of mind. A trait which you excel at in the small-scale.%%%%By harnessing SOUL, you can focus on a single target, and see their power skyrocket. Normal hands may now shatter stone. Bolts of SOUL turn into meteors. Their true power is unleashed, for as long as you continue to focus SOUL into them, this ascension of power steadily draining your reserves at around 8% every second.%%%%%%Something I will note is that if you also possess Breadth of Mind, having more minds focusing on the target of Ascension will increase the recipient’s power further, but on a far smaller level. It might take dozens to double it’s effects from what is described. Another thing to note is the power increase scales up depending on how powerful the recipient was in the first place. For instance, bolstering someone who could shatter stone naturally might allow them to do similar with metal, or even tougher materials. Just take what they can do, and practically triple it for the Ascension. In addition, for the booster, once they get the full boost up to ascended level, you can still use it on them, it just won’t scale any further than that.%%%%%%Boosted:%%Your supportive powers are potent, and the addition of the Void does not increase their power, but their permanency.%%%%Consistently utilizing Ascension on a target will grant them a portion of said power permanently, eventually granting their full benefits always. This may take several dozen sessions and a lot of SOUL, but let their potential be fully realized, and then, push it even further beyond.,,
Voidtouched - Indecipherable Visage,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,The Void is an amorphous, empty thing. It has no mind, at least not anymore. Those corrupted by its touch are often hollow shells. While you’re not quite at that point, its influence still lies beneath.%%%%Your face is a mask all its own, hiding your true intentions and emotions from others, regardless of your current mood. This makes you unpredictable, and perfect for luring others into a false sense of security.,,
Voidtouched - Shade Sorcery,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,While most entities of Void do not possess SOUL, being entities of that purest potential, those that do are said to have been some of the first proper users of it. Basic, but powerful. Great missiles nearly the size of one’s body, devastating crashes into the ground, storms of wraiths that blot out the ceiling.%%%%The secrets behind these basic sorceries are yours now, ready to remove all who oppose you in a torrent of screaming spirits.%%%%%%This essentially allows access to the basic Hollow Knight spells. These use their upgraded versions, if curious.,,
Voidtouched - Creeping Corruption,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Void corrupts nearly all it contacts. A still pool changes and warps its surroundings, darkening them, sterilizing the air as strands of Void stretch it’s influence further. It affects people, changing perceptions, warping them to suit the Void’s needs, molding them into servants, their influence clear within the dark streaks the Void leaves underneath their eyes.%%%%You have become a proliferator of this corrupting influence, subtly shifting and changing that around you into something far more suited for a creature of your dark inclinations, be it the environment or people.%%%%Toggleable after the jump.,,
Voidtouched - Lord of Shades,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,It is said that the civilization that predated Hallownest’s conception worshipped the darkness, holding the powers of the Void in their hands, they nearly claimed the whole of it in thanks to such devotion and research. And this worship wasn’t baseless, no, there was something within those dark waters, a mind of great power. One who could exhibit control over the whole of the Void, one to whom any of dark bowed to. The Lord of Shades, and while you may not be the original, you’re quite close.%%%%All beings or entities associated with darkness or the Void gain a large respect for your presence.%%%%In addition, your body has swelled to massive proportions, becoming a great four armed titan of Void with a countless array of tendrils.%%%%Your physical strength is greatly magnified in this state, and your affinity for any form of dark magic or SOUL sorcery is amplified immensely as well.%%%%If you desire, you can condense your form somewhat for movement, though this does limit your strength.%%%%%%Yes, you are as big as the actual Shade Lord, but considering how malleable Void is, it can look however you wish shape-wise. Have legs or tentacles or smoke, all up to you. In addition, the condensed form can be as small as one of Hallownest’s smaller creatures, such as Tiktiks and the like.%%%%%%Boosted:%%By taking in the Void Heart, your status as Lord is fully solidified, and your powers over the dark expanded. The respect given by dark beings has been amplified to direct authority. They can refuse you if given sufficient reason, but such beings, be they of dark or Void see you as a true and proper leader, and are willing to take heed of your word.%%%%In addition, you have learned to infuse Void into any of your magics, granting them the boon your form grants to such magic.,,
Paleborn - Of God and Void,,1,,00,,False,,True,,Paleborn Exclusive%%%%Must take the Failures and No Voice Drawbacks for no CP Gain%%%%The Pale King sent so many down into that pit. Threw thousands upon thousands of corpses of their children down into the Abyss, hoping for one single pure vessel out of the Void that fused with their children. While perhaps you may not be the vessel they wanted, you are a Vessel nonetheless.%%%%You now count as Voidtouched for the purposes of discounts and purchases.,,
Paleborn - Pure Focus,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,One of the most intrinsic of traits for the likes of Higher Beings, and one your blood allows you to share.%%%%Focusing stored SOUL within yourself, you can mend wounds, the process only taking a handful of seconds.%%%%It can be interrupted, but as long as you have SOUL, it can be done.,,
Paleborn - Radiant Visage,,1,,-2000,,False,,True,,Your very body seems to exude a natural glowing aura, able to exude moods on those around it.%%%%Whether an aura of peace or one of an imposing presence, all around can feel it.%%%%After the jump, this aura can be suppressed entirely or in parts, shielding its physical glow or the mood-altering effects.,,
Paleborn - Spider's Web,,1,,-4000,,False,,True,,Your use of SOUL is fine and precise, to the point of where you can make long strands of thread from your very SOUL.%%%%This can be utilized for numerous purposes, from forming sheets of thread to block attacks, storms of thread to slice apart opponents, infusing weaponry with it to bolster its potency, or to zip from place to place with the aid of a tool that can make use of its near indestructible nature.,,
Paleborn - Prime Form,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,Through intense, constant training of body and soul, you have reached your kind’s true potential, only seen once before in the Hollow Knight.%%%%Your size has grown immensely, towering over most in Hallownest, granting the strength to cleave smaller bugs in twain and lift blades larger than most bugs.%%%%Combined with a mastery and bolstering of your SOUL, its pool of energy turned into a near reservoir, able to cast spell after spell with barely a break in-between. This is further complimented by their breadth and power.%%%%Conjure bursts of sharpened swords with but a flick of your wrist, plunge it into the earth and watch as a surge of blades eviscerate the area around you, and more.%%%%%%If you’re curious on how much of an increase your pool gets, just take the pool, and basically quadruple it. It’s based off the Pure Vessel, who in battle can seemingly cast countless spells on end for the duration of the fight., Also, seen a few people a touch annoyed at the increased size, but the Pure Vessel certainly wasn’t a munchkin like the Knight, and that’s the entire basis for the perk. If it annoys you, the boosted version’s shapeshifting can be used to shorten yourself somewhat.%%%%%%Boosted:%%With a mixture of paleblood and Void, little is beyond your grasp. Your body is now partially made of Void, allowing light shapeshifting, such as the creation of huge lashing tendrils or additional appendages to hold things. However, what’s more improved is your mind.%%%%Your body and mind are now completely immune to corruption, mind control possession, and mutation, in fact, such a thing may turn back on the perpetrator, or a the possesser might become trapped inside of yourself. Become a truly Pure Vessel and succeed where the Pale King failed.,,
Nail,,2,,00,,False,,True,,The Nail is a simple, versatile weapon, utilized by all sorts of people, be they travelers, warriors, or even more scholarly types for utility.%%%%The Nail comes in countless forms, be they knives, swords, lances, or even blunt weapons such as maces and clubs. Built sturdy and to pierce through chitinous exteriors, few would be without one. This nail comes in whatever shape you desire, but is basic and in need of proper refinement.,,
Hot Spring,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,You seem to have acquired a copy of one of Hallownest’s luxurious Hot Springs, said to have existed from a time even before the kingdom rose. These springs are not only refreshing, but almost magical.%%%%Resting in one of these springs can heal wounds and refresh one’s pools of magical energies, be they of SOUL or something else entirely. You may place this spring in your Warehouse or another abode you may possess.,,
Lumafly Hive,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,Free for Lord of the Lumaflies%%%%You’ve gotten yourself a hold of a large tank filled with a self-sustaining population of Lumaflies. These creatures don’t need sustenance to live, and with the right wrangling, can be quite useful for lighting and electrical purposes among other things.,,
Tram Pass,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,An old tram pass, recognizing the bearer as one of the few privileged to ride the great Tramways of Hallownest. While its use is simple here, it’s uses become far more interesting outside of the jump.%%%%Firstly, it grants passage on any form of transportation for free, and secondly, while underground within other worlds, one may brandish the pass, setting up a tramway of your own through the underground, allowing you to cross vast distances as far as you please, as long as both beginning and end are locations underground.%%%%%%If the wording is confusing for the secondary effect, it works like so. You head to an underground location and brandish the pass to the air. In a couple moments, the closest wall will burst open, revealing the Tram and setting up a Tramway. You designate an end location and it transports you there. They move at around 100 mph, but it’s possible to modify them and have said modifications stick. And yes, you can handle fragile goods with them. No delicate flowers being destroyed on this tram’s watch.,,
Drop In - Pimpillo,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Well, isn’t this a curious device. One that promises of destruction to those who oppose it’s wielder. Originally developed in the land of Pharloom, the Pimpillo is a devastating grenade, primed and thrown, often exploding on impact. One of the best options for clearing a room.%%%%You have a dozen on your person, a number which rejuvenates every week within your Warehouse.,,
Scholar - Arcane Egg,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A curious black orb, perfectly round in shape. A little too perfect, if one is being honest.%%%%These orbs are potent devices from before Hallownest’s time, used as massive storage devices for information, stored in a highly secure and extremely durable egg.%%%%While this one is empty, the ability to store massive quantities of information with only a small amount of SOUL is a highly useful thing to possess, indeed.%%%%%%This thing can hold basically a supercomputer’s worth of data. Uses SOUL to store it, no need for writing. Could be possible to hook it up with other systems if you could figure a way to turn SOUL into other forms of energy.,,
Scholar - Crystal Heart,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,The heart of one of Hallownest’s old Automatons, crafted to harvest the curious crystals of the Peak. This one has been fashioned into a necklace of sorts.%%%%By grasping it, you can channel it’s power, locking yourself in place on the ground, crystals sprouting at your feet. Then, upon release, the Heart unleashes it’s true energy, launching you forward at breakneck speeds through the air, allowing a rather simplified and fairly dangerous version of flight.,,
Shopkeeper - Pale Ore,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A highly sought after material, filled with pale energy.%%%%Pale Ore was often used in the creation of mastercrafted armor and weaponry, for the edges it can produce are ever keen and never require sharpening or maintenance, and their durability is said to outstrip that of many rare alloy metals.%%%%In addition, their cold bite can often quickly inflict frostbite on unprotected foes.%%%%You’ve managed to arrange shipments of this ore, granting you several chunks of it every week, more than enough to make a handful of weapons of a suit of armor.,,
Nailmaster - Mantis Claws,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A large set of claws carved from bone, easily attachable to one’s hands and feet, and easily retractable as well. These claws allow one to hook into solid surfaces, be they of stone, dirt or metal, and utilize that time hooked to leap off.%%%%The Mantids who utilize these are known as quick, agile hunters capable of climbing near any surface, and this allows you much the same flexibility as they.,,
Dreamseer - Whispering Seeds,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A set of seeds, which when planted in near any environment will eventually form a Whispering Root. Whispering Roots can access the history of the lands they’re planted in, and can serve as a conduit to the dreamworld if you desire quick access.,,
Mosskin - Effigy of Unn,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A large statue of the great slug-like being, clad in mossy stone. Causes plantlife placed around it to grow far more rapidly and for those that are edible to ripen to perfect form for consumption.,,
Mosskin - Isma's Tear,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A solidified, green tear almost resembling a pear in shape, a blessing of the old knight Isma. While on one’s person, this tear grants immunity to the dangerous effects of acid, as well as general immunity to corrosive effects.,,
Troupe Follower - Lantern's Light,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A large metal staff that splits into several strands at it’s end, each forming into a sharp claw. Within the claw, a constant scarlet flame flickers. Preferred weapon of the Grimmkin.%%%%This staff innately bolsters any kind of pyromancy put through it, be it of Nightmare of otherwise. Non-Nightmare flames gain a red tinge when cast through the weapon.%%%%In addition, holding the weapon on their person renders the user practically immune to fire.,,
Troupe Follower - Phantasmal Tents,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A set of large tents, decorated in scarlet and adorned with mask-like entryways.%%%%They function as normal tents, and are large enough to hold a reasonably sized circus within, but their main trait of note is the capability to summon and desummon them at any time in a plume of red smoke. Now you can bring the show of a lifetime wherever you please.,,
Troupe Follower - Scarlet Root Cloak,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A well-fitting black and scarlet cloak of countless strands formed from a Whispering Root, warped by introduction of Nightmare Essence and slaved to the user’s will.%%%%At will, one can extend the strands of the cloak to attempt to impale an enemy with the same force as a nail. Overwhelm an enemy from every angle, or send the strands into the ground, turning an arena into a deadly pit of spikes.,,
Godseeker - Godtuner,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A small bronze compass-like device. Resonates with beings of great power, allowing one to follow the devices directions to find them.%%%%What happens afterwards is up to the user, but the device seems to be able to ‘record’ the signatures of these beings for some purpose or another, whether the being is defeated or not. Perhaps you may find it’s true purpose in the,,
Godseeker - Weathered Mask,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A faded bronze mask, the signature adornment of the Godseekers.%%%%Wearing this helm seems to grant an otherworldly clarity to things, allowing easy focus for tasks, clearing of headaches, and most notably, an increase in potency to any form of magic or psychic powers involving or stemming from the mind.,,
Voidtouched - Mothwing Cloak,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,A cloak made of several strands, made of rare materials created from moths. Allows the user to burst forward a few meters in a straight line. Functions even in the air, allowing for quick evasion of attacks, but must charge afterwards.%%%%Requires the user to contact a surface to refresh it’s charge.,,
Voidtouched - Soul Vessel,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,A strange grey orb with three holes on the front and a highly intricate design. Used by an ancient civilization to store SOUL in addition to a normal pool.%%%%Having it on your person grants a secondary pool that is around 1/3rd of the strength of your standard. When your pool is full, it will enter the Vessel, and upon your pool draining, will dump it’s SOUL back in almost instantaneously, giving you a boost of energy.%%%%You may purchase up to 3 of these.,,
Paleborn - Thread Mines,,2,,-1000,,False,,True,,Small spheroids covered in holes. When tosses, they will lock in the air after a few moments, near invisible strands linking them to nearby surfaces as spikes burst from the holes. An excellent form of denying movement to an aerial foe, although sufficient force can knock them down.,,
Paleborn - Monarch Wings,,2,,-2000,,False,,True,,A small metal clasp, able to attach to and stick to one’s back.%%%%After attaching, you can will yourself to sprout a set of four phantasmal wings capable of generating a burst of lift before fading. This can be used even after a jump, allowing one supreme aerial mobility. The size of the wings scales upwards with your size, as well as the extra height it provides. Be careful not to bash your head into ceilings, though.,,
Charms,,2,,110,,False,,False,,Charms are unique items, each giving a boost to your abilities in numerous ways. These curios of power can be slotted to Charm Notches, three of which you get for free, and eight more can be found throughout Hallownest.%%%%Thus for convenience, let’s say you have 11 slots to work with.%%%%There are many charms, but you can only bring so many with you as you leave, as each charm takes up a certain amount of notches. Choose wisely.,,

Charm - Defender's Crest,,1,,-10,,False,,True,,One notch%%%%This charm gives you a powerful, heroic odour! In others words, you stink. Really, really badly. This charm gives you a wafting aura of stink around you, potent enough to actually cause minor, constant damage to those who wander within the cloud. A decent deterrent, but i’d recommend taking it off if you value any kind of social interaction.,,

Dying Light,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,Hallownest has been in ruins for a long time, and it’s taken its toll.%%%%Lumaflies, the main source of light in the caves, are dying off. Areas are darker, interiors once well lit now plunged into darkness, yet even as the light dies, the Infection still rages on.,,
Soul Sieve,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,SOUL doesn’t seem to be able to stick with you for very long. If not used within an hour of gathering it, SOUL will begin to rapidly leak out of your pool, fading into the ether.,,
A Void Knowledge,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You lose any information about the setting during this jump.,,
No Voice to Cry Suffering,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You are mute, unable to make a single noise from your mouth, or utilize any other form of speech, such as telepathy. This can make communication quite problematic.,,
Failures,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,You have a deep seated set of mental issues swimming around your person. Abandonment, Loneliness, and more.%%%%You feel as if you can never get things right, even if praised. It is treatable, but it might take the majority of the jump to correct.,,
Protected at Last,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Among the current denizens of Hallownest, there are few as truly unknown as the entity simply referred to as “The Collector”. Said to be the source of the countless imprisoned grubs throughout the land, this strange entity of Void stalks the ruins, looking for more to imprison, to ‘keep them safe’. And now they’ve got a particular eye for you.%%%%They won’t attack you directly, resorting to trying to catch you when you least expect it, or even capturing your other allies as well. This won’t kill you, but waking up and finding yourself in some remote end of Hallownest surrounded by foes and stuck in a glass jar is bound to be irritating and potentially lethal.%%%%While elusive, the Collector is not untraceable, and destroying the thing may stop these inconvenient escapades... if you can find them, that is.,,
Infestation,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,Within the Royal Waterways, a horrible set of disgusting creatures have emerged, the Flukes.%%%%Disturbingly resilient to death, these creatures have primarily infested the Waterways, but now, they’re expanding rapidly. Sightings of them have reached as far as the Crystal Peak, and practically every area in Hallownest now has a nest of Flukes within it, all Infected by the Radiance’s light and territorial to all.%%%%You’ll find many of these creatures in your travels, being an always present and ever hard to deal with pest. Perhaps if you can destroy their Nests and the Flukemarms attached to them, their numbers might slow.,,
Emptiness,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,A deep, dark emptiness resides within yourself. Your emotions are nonexistent, or close to it. You cannot understand things such as empathy, or bring yourself to sympathize with anything at all. All that is left is cold, unfeeling logic.,,
Relinquished Mind,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,You came from Hallownest, but leaving it sacrificed your self, only returned upon reentering, but not without cost.%%%%All memories of your chain are missing. Perhaps you may regain them in time, but for now, it’s just you in a strange, foreign land in a body you don’t even remember having. And Hallownest is not a forgiving place, especially to the unprepared.,,
No Cost too Great,,4,,4000,,False,,True,,Your approach to things has become rather... extreme, in many’s eyes. When aiming to solve a problem, you don’t care about the costs, be they material or in lives.%%%%Everything to you is merely a resource.%%%%Morals don’t apply to your problem solving, there is no cost large enough to you to even hesitate to act on it, even if you aren’t even sure if the plan of action you’re taking will work at all.,,
Void without Focus,,4,,4000,,False,,False,,Normally, a small vessel would make its way from the King’s Pass and in one way or another, proceed throughout the ruined kingdom and stop the Infection, one way or another. But that won’t happen, this time. There will be no savior for Hallownest, and the Infection will only grow in power before the Kingdom is consumed by the Old Light. That is, unless you take action yourself.,,
Primal Nature,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,If you asked travelers what the most dangerous creature in Hallownest is, many would point to the Primal Aspid. Not for their power, but their reliability. Firing spread shots of acidic goop, the Primal Aspid is difficult to avoid, highly erratic in movement, flying, and most notably, numerous. Many a traveler could take on a Primal Aspid one on one, but multiple is just asking for trouble.%%%%Unfortunately for you, it seems that the Primal Aspid population has spiked enormously, the buggers being capable of being found everywhere, from the Howling Cliffs to the depths of Deepnest. Even worse, they have evolved depending on their environment. Those in the Fungal Wastes emit noxious clouds of spores with their projectiles, while those in the Crystal Peak fire a spread of lasers instead, courtesy of the crystals attached to them.%%%%And to make it even worse, each and every one of them desires nothing more than your death, and know exactly where you are.%%%%It’s said that there is a source for this infestation, lurking in the depths of the Kingdom’s Edge. A great broodmother, grown fat on Wyrmflesh and bloated by the Infection, its spawn and itself imbued with the remnants of power left within the Wyrm King’s old form. It is a wholly powerful foe, the infection turning it into a near match for Old Light they serve, and they’re aided by swarms of their kin.%%%%Perhaps killing it may stifle the Aspids, but even lacking the tracking granted by their mother, they still hunt, ever present, ever hungry for your misery.,,
Prey,,4,,6000,,False,,False,,Hallownest, at its height, was a place of luxury, relaxation, a place where countless bugs were so enamored with the prospect of currency and civilization that survival instincts went out the window. In Hallownest’s ruin, it is survival of the fittest, and there are few closer to the top than the Hunter of Greenpath. This massive beast is smart, cunning, and without mercy. They have hunted practically every creature in Hallownest, from its highest peaks to the depths far below the capital.%%%%They are utterly ruthless, and now they see new prey in you. Their strength is that to rip bugs apart with their bare hands, to rend armor with massive jaws and sharpened claws. They are incredibly quick too, able to easily outpace most, and if not outpace, then outlast in terms of stamina. But none of this is their greatest strength, no, it’s their guile. Setting traps, luring creatures to weaken you, blocking passageways, they will wear you down bit by bit with attrition, and then, finally go for the kill when you least expect it.%%%%Despite their large size, the hunter is a master of stealth and ambush, and for all you know, you’re being watched the entire time.,,
Bindings,,4,,00,,False,,False,,The Godseekers always wished to test the worth of those who came before them. To see them reduced to their lowest point, and see whether they triumph or break under the pressure. To facilitate this, they created bindings intended to level the field, to bring even the most powerful down to par. And unluckily, it seems some of these bindings have been placed upon your person.%%%%There are four bindings to choose from. The first gives 400, and each after gives an additional 200. Will you ascend? Or shatter?%%%%%%Binding Of Shell: Your vitality has been stripped, reduced to that of a normal human. Considering even natural weapons here were meant to break through and rip apart hard armor more than soft flesh, you best tread carefully.%%%%Binding of Nail: Your power has been bound, your physical strength little more than that of an average bug, and your weapons no better than a broken sword.%%%%Binding of Soul: Your soul has been weakened, and your magic turned to ether in the wind. Your usage of outside magic is halted, and your SOUL reserves can only hold enough to launch a single spell or a single Focus before emptying.%%%%Binding of Charm: Your items and armor are stripped from you for the jump, as well as anything gained from here, including the Charm section. You can still select charms and items to take, but they will only be given after the jump.,,
Scenarios,,5,,00,,False,,False,,Scenarios are, in essence, additional “missions” of sorts. Wholly isolated from your normal chain, these occur after your time here is over. These scenarios can offer unique reward exclusive to them. However, there is a catch.%%%%You may only use abilities and items acquired from this jump to complete them. Failing these challenges does not end your chain, but it does forfeit the rewards. These scenarios are completely optional, and you may attempt as many as you like.%%%%In addition, drawbacks within the chain are not active during Scenarios and you cannot access your Warehouse or any other items within it during them as well.,,
Fit for a Fool,,5,,00,,False,,True,,The Colosseum of Fools. While it has turned to more barbarous means in more recent times, the Colosseum has existed almost as long as Hallownest has. It was once a simple gladiatorial arena, but then, the Lord whom presided over it grew bored. They desired something more thrilling. Thus, they hired accomplished engineers and put them to work. They constructed more deadly arenas, ones that could shift on the Lord’s whim. Spike-traps, fire, and an ever shifting arena caused its popularity to skyrocket, as well as it’s rate of lethality. This increased so much that even the Pale King took interest, and while they wouldn’t officialize such a barbarous thing, they sent a contender of their own to reinforce their will. However, in this instance, that contender would never make it through. Displeased, the Pale King looked to someone more worthy. You.%%%%You are to fight within the Colosseum of Fools as an agent of the Pale King. You must climb up the ranks of contenders, facing countless challenges along the way, and claim the title as the first Champion of Fools. Those you will face are wide and varied, bloodthirsty fighters, all of them, hailing not just from Hallownest, but beyond. However, at its end is the greatest challenge of all. Even if the King’s first contender didn’t make it through didn’t mean they died. No, they survived, the King abandoning them after the loss. Considering their devotion to the King, this made them furious. So they trained, reinforced themselves, and even managed to tame a great Oblobble as a mount, using them to carve their way up the ranks of the Fools on their own.%%%%The Pale Lurker desires your blood, and they’ve taken every precaution to ensure your death. On their own, while they may not possess SOUL sorcery, they possess a thousands tricks up their sleeves, being a former assassin. Lightning fast movement, volleys of knives, and movement restricting mines alongside a host of other gadgets and explosives are just the tip of what they possess, for the arena too is against you, courtesy of a hefty bribe to the Lord Fool. The ground will shift underneath you, buzzsaws will spin, spikes will impale, and the arena will ever favor the Lurker.%%%%But if you can overcome this great foe, and stand before the Fool, head held high, you will receive a set of cheers so vigorous that even the Lord Fool is impressed at the show you’ve made. And thus, you have been showered in prizes by both the audience and the Lord Fool themselves.%%%%%%%%Rewards:%%Firstly, upon the corpse of the Lurker, you find the reasoning for their original survival. A charm of Unbreakable Heart.%%%%This charm toughens your flesh and thickens your insides, making harm affect you far less than it otherwise would. This charm costs no Notches.%%%%%%Secondly, you are granted the title of Champion of Fools. Simply uttering your name in other worlds can instill fear or respect, depending on who you speak to, for your skill in combat is known to be legendary.%%%%This is optional when speaking, so you do not instill fear in everybody you talk to.%%%%%%Thirdly, in addition to a large mass of several thousand geo that was flung into the arena after the fight and the extra thousands from serving the King so dutifully, the Lord Fool rewards you for destroying the upstart Lurker by granting you a boon of companionship. The Colosseum oftentimes breeds bugs specifically for use in the area. Hardened, armored, these bugs are trained for battle. The Lord has been toying with a pet project, taming one of the great hunters of the Edge, the Primal Aspid. More specifically, one of the last queens of their kind. They are still small, but when fully grown, they would dwarf near every bug alive.%%%%And as a gift, you are given this creature as a pet and companion.%%%%It’s vulnerable rear has been covered with chitin, and it’s wings increased in size. It will take a while, but even now they function as a smart, capable battle companion, firing spreads of acid at foes while darting around them. It responds to orders very well and is surprisingly cuddly towards you.%%%%When fully grown, the Queen is more than large enough to suit as a proper mount for even a larger bug, and its spreads of acid have turned into pressurized streams of it, capable of corroding steel in mere moments.%%%%In addition, it can reproduce asexually, allowing you to breed more of these creatures if you so desire., if you desire to give your allies similar protection.,,
The Great Heist,,5,,00,,False,,True,,During Hallownest’s height, Geo flowed. It was what made the world go ‘round. What seperated the beggars from the fattened aristocrats. While the Pale King cared not for their fattened lifestyles, they were useful to him, and thus they allowed this and even endorsed it, expanding the economy of Hallownest further and further.%%%%And the economy’s heart lied within the center of that city in the form of the Hallownest Pale Bank. Every piece of Geo that has entered the economy at some point went through this bank, whether for inspection, storage, or lending, it was the beating heart that connected everything together. The King knew this, so they invested their own share into it, most notably in terms of defenses. The defenses that the bank would receive would be the testing bed for the White Palace’s own security. Collapsing floors, deployable spike and buzzsaw traps, SOUL totems reworked into life-draining sentries. And most of all, the Moulds.%%%%The Moulds make up the majority of the security force within the Bank, armed with the finest armor and weaponry, even the numerous Wingsmould patrols adorned with large spike launchers affixed to the sides of their shell. These Moulds are commanded by the former captain of the Pale King’s Royal Guard, a great hulking brute with as much brains as brawn. Of recent note is an acquired shipment of exotic goods from a foreign land, due to be shipped to one of the wealthiest bugs in the city, Lurien the Watcher. Their value alone is enough for anyone to live lavishly for the rest of their lives. It is currently being stored in a great vault accessed from the building’s center, and sealed with potent Seals, locks, and sorcery., enough to bar even the most powerful of spells or enchantments to get through it’s pale walls. Your task, as you might’ve pieced together is to raid this bank and somehow and someway make off with this treasure preferably with your limbs intact. Whether quiet or loud, you have many methods for doing this, but all will require more than a fair amount of skill to accomplish.%%%%%%%%Rewards:%%Firstly and immediately, you receive a very large sum of funds due to your successful heist, equivalent to 35,000 Geo, or closer to several million dollars, as this fund will be able to change to the currency most relevant to you when you require it (this goes for all Geo acquired from the scenarios, by the way).%%%%Secondly, you gain the Unbreakable Greed charm, which multiplies any currency gained from any means by 40%. This charm does not cost Notches.%%%%Finally, you gain a respect among thieves in any world you go to, making them far more amicable and trustworthy to you than they may otherwise be.,,
Ill Fated Venture,,5,,00,,False,,True,,The tramways are one of the biggest accomplishments before Hallownest’s fall. Creating sets of vehicles that didn’t need food and water like Stags, only occasional maintenance. They were faster, stronger, and could hold more people at a time. Two Tramways were made before the fall. The first, the short experimental tram between the Crossroads and the Resting Grounds, however, more ambitiously was the large tramway that aimed to link together the most disparate of areas, stretching from the Kingdom’s Edge to the Basin, and then a final one aimed to finally link Deepnest to the greater realms of Hallownest.%%%%That final one never came to fruition. Relations between the Weaver Tribe and the kingdom were always strained, and this intrusion into their land was not met with kindness by them or the countless swarming primal insects that haunted those grounds. Progress was made, then halted as groups of bugs constantly harassed and sabotaged operations. The light guard the tram workers possessed was not enough against the onslaught, and so it failed. Some would say it was doomed to such from the start. But perhaps if something was a little different, that might change.%%%%You have been assigned as head of the Tramway work teams, and your task is to establish and maintain a tramway station within Deepnest. You must use whatever you possess to make sure the Deepnest Tram becomes fully operational, and more so, safe. Whether this involves negotiation, extermination, or engineering other methods around the dangers of Deepnest, this must be done. You have 2 days to prepared within the capital before being sent off on the trip, where you shall be until your task is done. You fail if the work crews are killed and the Tram is made unoperational.%%%%%%%%Rewards:%%While the Weavers themselves aren’t entirely pleased at the irritance your venture has cause, and even more so at it’s evident success, their leader doesn’t share the same opinion. You have impressed the ever-aloof Herrah the Beast, by showing them that somebody within the Pale King’s kingdom has proper backbone, will, and courage to face the horrors of Deepnest and conquer them such. Thus, they award you with a handful of gifts of their own in addition to that provided for completing the project in the first place.%%%%The first of Herrah’s gifts is a giant spool of Weaver silk, something they do not give lightly. Weaver silk is infused with SOUL, and makes a wonderful catalyst for runes and rituals, and when made into clothing, one will find the clothes made are incredibly soft, and their material allows them a durability near equalling that of proper metal armor as well as allowing magic or SOUL channeled through it to function incredibly well.%%%%Secondly, they grant you a charm of Unbreakable Strength, representing your will in challenging the dark. It grants you moderately increased physical strength as well as making all of your weapons cut, slice, or bash their targets that much harder. This charm costs no Notches.%%%%Finally, in addition to your pay of several thousand Geo, your efforts have also caught the eye of the ever elusive Menderbug guild, who are impressed at your dedication to building and offer their services to you.%%%%Any tool that you might break or damage caused to friendly structures will find themselves repaired overnight, no fuss or hassle. You’ll never see these bugs, for they pride themselves in functioning in the background, but any thanks to them for their efforts will be surely appreciated.,,
For the Flame,,5,,00,,False,,True,,The Grimm Troupe is a curious cult of sorts. A travelling troupe, bound to their leader, who is in turn is but a vessel for the Lord of Nightmares, the Nightmare Heart. They travel from broken land to broken land at the behest of a lantern’s call, gathering the remnants of the kingdom and performing a ritual of succession, to ensure the Heart continues it’s song forevermore.%%%%You’ve found yourself at the start of a ritual in a far corner of Hallownest, one on the brink of collapse from Infection. And you are given a new task. Gather the Flames and perform the ritual. Ensure the continuation of the Troupe.%%%%To gather these flames, one will be accompanied by a small being bound by Charm, a Grimmchild, one who will start out as little more than a pest and with the power of Flame, will grow into a quite useful ally for battle. You must cover the long stretches of Hallownest in its death throes, battling the Grimmkin tasked to gather flame and take it from them. Each is a potent pyromancer, as quick as they are lethal. In addition, the Pale King knows of your intrusion, and even as they prepare a final solution, they despise the presence of the Troupe and will do all in their power to stop you, sending kill-squads of Moulds after your presence while twisting the caverns to impede you.%%%%After gathering two sets of 3 flames, you must return to the ritual site, and face Grimm themselves, to further the ritual. They are a master of combat, mixing flame and claw, warping around the arena in entirely unpredictable manners, or utilizing their Scarletroot Cape to attempt to skewer you. Upon defeat, they give you a smile and tell you to gather a final set of flame, taking you into some of the most dangerous parts of Hallownest, including the White Palace itself, which will do all in it’s power to stop you from taking its flame with countless tricks, traps, and massive groups of Moulds, and in desperation, they may even send the Pure Vessel themselves after you, a near godlike being in it’s own right, conjuring storms of SOUL merely by Focusing, and coating the ground in blades nearly as tall as the room itself. Only once you best them can you gather the flame and quickly retreat.%%%%Once finished, you return, only to find a gateway. Entering it will find yourself in the Realm of Nightmares, before the presence of the Nightmare Heart itself. It is here you must perform the final task, a final dance of death against the truest form of Grimm, the Nightmare King incarnate. If the Pure Vessel was close to a god, then Grimm is truly worthy of the title. Bathing the ground in scarlet flame that can burn through steel, moving almost quicker than the eye can see, conjuring wrathful fire that hunts you down, lashing out with claws as sharp as swords, and splitting into a swarm of insects to overwhelm and confuse you.%%%%But if you can best them, they stand, giving a final bow before warping before the great Heart overlooking the arena, beating faster and faster, and then, in a flash of scarlet light and a scream, Grimm is utterly destroyed, it’s essence reabsorbed by the heart as the ritual is completed.%%%%%%%%Rewards:%%After the ritual, you wake up at the ritual site, it’s implements gone, leaving you in a barren cave. But the nightmare Heart is pleased at the completion of the Ritual, and the Grimmchild still beside you is one part of that. You gain them as a companion, and eventually, they will transform into a being resembling Grimm.%%%%Although, they are wholly different beings, even if both are vessels for the Heart, and can be influenced and taught just as well as a regular child. It might take a few years for them to fully grow, but at the end, you’ll have a loyal god of fire and nightmares at your side, often treating you as a parental figure.%%%%%%Secondly, while asleep, you will never face a nightmare again, and will always wake up fully refreshed and wide awake. In addition, any wounds or sicknesses you suffered from the previous day will be gone. Finally, you are granted an immunity to flame of any kind, and in fact, flames can invigorate you and heal your wounds.,,
The Blackwyrm,,5,,00,,False,,True,,The Pale King is not the only Wyrm. Not at all. Other Wyrms exist, looking for suitable homes or suitable potential kingdoms to create. And on occasion, these Wyrms clash. Being highly individualistic creatures, they often squabble over territory, their lands contested and their power often resulting in the destruction of the lands they fought over in the first place.%%%%Unfortunately, the Pale King’s encounter with one only occurred after their molting, after they gave up their immense physical strength to rule properly. Thus came the Blackwyrm.%%%%A large Wyrm, even among their titanic kind, one coated in ebony black chitin and a jagged maw of teeth, with powers of SOUL as great as it’s physical bulk. An ancient thing with a dominating temperament. It found Hallownest, and began to turn some of its people to their call. Fearing the destruction a civil war could bring, the Pale King consulted to their own means and located the Wyrm, eventually sending their best warriors to combat it, among them being those who would eventually become the Five Great Knights of Hallownest.%%%%But something has gone wrong. The scales have tipped in the Blackwyrm’s favor, and if it continues this way, Hallownest will fall to war. This is where you come in. You must assist the knights and their entourage, punch through the Blackwyrm’s defenses of trained warriors and miners enslaved to the Wyrm’s will, enter their staging grounds for invasion in the wastes past the Crystal Peak, and destroy the Blackwyrm, once and for all.%%%%%%%%Rewards:%%The Blackwyrm itself, even in death provides many a good, and the Pale King allows you to take what you desire from it. Of most note is the Wyrm’s chitin. An immensely tough material far outstripping the durability of anything in Hallownest, perfect for any kind of equipment. It is also extremely useful for methods of enchantment, responding well to any kind applied to it, amplifying their effects.%%%%%%Next is what is found deep within its corpse. The shattered remains of an egg, a failed attempt at rebirth in the last moments of it’s life to save itself. Of more note is the energy emanating from it, and upon touching it, one will find themselves marked with the Brand of a King.%%%%Through this, no door is barred from your passage, and showing it to guards asserts your authority as being allowed to be there.%%%%It also allows you far more weight in conversations with powerful beings or entities, your words being far more impactful than they otherwise might be.%%%%%%Finally, you earn the gratitude and respect of those who would become the Five Great Knights and those of the entourage still alive. You may take them all as companions, counting as one.%%%%Of the Knights are Mighty Hegemol, a maggot who crafted themselves a great mechanical body, known for their intelligence, strength, and humor. Fierce Dryya, master swordsman known for their steadfast nature and wisdom, Mysterious Ze’mer, user of SOUL and nail in conjunction and known for their inquisitive nature and empathy, Kindly Isma, a master of a special form of SOUL sorcery involving manipulation and creation of plants, known for their motherly instinct and sincerity, and Loyal Ogrim, as strong as they are boisterous, a true knightly figure and a friend to all.,,
The Gods of Hollwonest,,5,,00,,False,,True,,The Godseekers arrive in this land, seeking Gods. Not gods as you or I perceive them. Powerful beings, strong warriors and mages and true gods alike, they wish to attune to them, to bask in their glory, and to find the true one they seek.%%%%The God of Gods.%%%%A true being to follow, bask, and attune to perfect Focus. They lie in the Pantheon within their great mind, and they search and search and bask in what they find. You find yourself in this mindscape, this Godhome. And you must find what they cannot. The God of Gods, at the peak of their focus. But to do this, you must prove yourself worthy. Four Pantheons await you, increasing in difficulty with each. One powerful foe after another, with only a single break in the middle to calm yourself. You will fight everything, from primal animals and infected beings to some of the greatest to have ever walked Hallownest’s grounds.%%%%And even if you beat the 4th, you are not done. There is a final Pantheon that awaits you, as does the God of Gods. The Pantheon of Hallownest. Every foe you fought within the first 4 are here, along with some being even more powerful than before. Fight after fight, you must triumph, and then defeat the God of Gods. If you succeed in this task, your rewards will be as immense as your hardships.%%%%%%%%Rewards:%%The Godseekers came from many places, many origins, many tasks, and among the most unique to their land were the Glorifiers, those who took those Charms of remembrance and amplified them, making the people behind them to always be remembered at their best.%%%%Each pantheon upgrades a set of charms, with the final granting an even larger boon. Defeating the first upgrades 1 Notch charms, the second 2 notches, and so on, ending with the final at the last and longest pantheon. Even if you fail the later pantheons, you still get all the upgrades gotten from completed ones.%%%%%%Pantheon 1 Upgrades:%%Wayward Compass: Wayward Compass now costs zero notches to equip, and grants a small sheath of lifeblood around your person, capable of dampening the blow of a single hit.%%%%Gathering Swarm: No longer brings it back to your person, rather it immediately brings taken valuables back to your Warehouse or other accessible abode.%%%%Thorns of Agony: Causes the retaliatory thorns to do further damage, and more so, turns it into a form of magic, allowing it to benefit from anything that bolsters sorcery.%%%%Sprintmaster: Instead of moving 15% faster, you now move 30% faster.%%%%Grubsong: Increases SOUL gained on hit from 5% to 25% depending on how injured you are.%%%%Steady Body: Knockback from any weapon you possess is doubled in regards to your person, and can affect you without damage, allowing one to propel themselves through the air with such weaponry.%%%%Defender’s Crest: The smell greatly expands in range and effect and only affects enemies, not allies.%%%%%%Pantheon 2 Upgrades:%%Spell Twister: Grants additional damage to your spells depending on how much you have left after casting, scaling down from 25% at near full to 0% at empty.%%%%Heavy Blow: Goes from doubling your knockback against foes to quadrupling it.%%%%Glowing Womb: Hatchings spawn 50% faster, now have a cap of 8 rather than 4, and take about half as much SOUL to create.%%%%Lifeblood Heart: Essentially doubles the protection the sheath provides, allowing you to take numerous hits before it fails completely.%%%%Weaversong: Weaverlings can now spit sticky, acidic webs at foes, giving them the ability to harass enemies at range.%%%%Fury of the Fallen: Nullifies a single hit that would have otherwise killed you. Ability regenerates once a day.%%%%Baldur Shell: Hits taken while shelled no longer interrupt your Focus.%%%%%%Pantheon 3 Upgrades%%Shaman Stone: Increases the size of your spells even further and allows them to penetrate enemies.%%%%Quick Slash: Allows one to swing even faster, making your blades become practical blurs when swung.%%%%Mark of Pride: Allows the projection to grant triple the range instead of double.%%%%Quick Focus: Focus even faster, allowing one to pull off a heal in under half a second.%%%%Carefree Melody: Melody now only loses half it’s charges upon activation.%%%%Dreamshield: Grants you a second shield, spinning directly opposite to the first. Has it’s own damage storage.%%%%Grubberfly’s Elegy: Allows one to fire off the projectiles of their 50% damage and range when not at full health.%%%%%%Pantheon 4 Upgrades:%%Hiveblood: Reduces it’s Notch cost by one, and coagulation and healing occurs 25% faster.%%%%Soul Eater: Greatly reduces the drain of the excess SOUL shield and allows your hits to draw in 100% more SOUL instead of 75%.%%%%Deep Focus: Increases the healing of Focus further by another 50%.%%%%Joni’s Blessing: Grants an even greater constitution and allows healing to function on you at 25% efficiency.%%%%%%Pantheon of Hallownest Upgrade:%%Kingsoul: Naturally generates 10% SOUL a second instead of 5%. Reduces it’s Notch Cost by one.%%%%%%Final Reward:%%The Godseekers bow to your might, and provide you a gift of servitude and Ascension. They wish to join you as a faithful set of servants, eager to please you however you wish. Their linked minds grant them immense intelligence, multitasking, and learning capability, and you may, if you wish, separate them out into multiple bodies if you so choose, although all will still be linked.%%%%As mentioned, the Godseekers have come from nearly every creed and status, and the things they don’t know how to do are few, at least within the setting. The Godseekers count as a single companion.%%%%In addition, their Focus upon your person has granted you great boons, bolstering your strength in a manner akin to the Ascension perk. Bask in your new glory, God of Gods, and show those cringers beneath you the power you have gained through blood, sweat, and tears.%%%%Finally, you are granted the Pantheons themselves, with the ability to re-challenge any of their ‘gods’ at will, if you so choose. If you possess a Godtuner, you can add those whose signature it captures to the Pantheons, allowing you to fight near any foe you encounter.,,
Hallownest Stands Eternal,,5,,00,,False,,False,,Few know the true fate Hallownest suffered. Its fall was great and innumerable died. Some from Infection, But many more simply because of the scared, fearful people throwing lives at the problem and seeing what stuck. You have been placed here, before the Infection has gotten out of control. Before the Soul Master took the lives of thousands in hopes of immortality, before the Pale King sent countless of their children into that Void-ridden shore, and left them to wither and die.%%%%You goal is simple. Save Hallownest and prevent the genocides to come. But simple does not mean easy. No, no, this will be a long, painful task, especially with the Radiance not bound to a single body. You must find a way to them and stop their madness, be it through deicide, or something different. Whichever you choose, you still gain the main reward, but depending on how you approach it, another reward may be obtained.%%%%Main Reward:%%You’ve done it. The dead finally sleep. The sickly smell and glow of orange fades from the tunnels and Hallownest releases a held-in breath. It is saved, not by their king or their followers, but a simple foreigner. And your reward? Why, the kingdom you just saved, of course. You receive Hallownest in it’s prime, it’s countless citizens eager to please you, and help you in your travels. From the highest point of Crystal Peak, to the darkest depths of Deepnest, its citizens bow to you, and even the Pale King is willing to heed your word. Rest easy, for Hallownest stands eternal, and it is all thanks to you.%%%%Reward (Deicide):%%The Old Light falls, and the Infection falters as a result. The reasonable method, although the direct path was something not even the Pale King expected to work, and thus, they are very, very impressed and pleased with the completion of your task. They escort you into the White Palace, and offer you a set of gifts in response, as well as their eternal gratitude. Firstly is a repurposed spark, taken by the King from the remnants of the Radiance, and infused with their Pale light. You now are a beacon of Mind, capable of uplifting hundreds of creatures into sentience at a time, if you so desire. You can even enforce some amount of gratitude and loyalty on these uplifted specimens, if you so desire.%%%%In addition, the Pale King offers a set of masterwork equipment, some of the finest within Hallownest, forged by the King themselves and imbued with their light to propel their strength far beyond what mere metal can provide, naturally bolstering your use of SOUL sorcery, to boot.%%%%Finally, you get an optional reward, if you so desire it, for the Pale King has figured your foreign origins, and is immensely curious. You may take them as a companion, if you so wish. In addition to their natural Beacon, they’re a powerful sorcerer, capable of conjuring storms of blades, spears, and saws at a moment’s notice, supplemented by their capability of flight and general inspiring presence.%%%%%%Reward (Spared):%%You found a way to resolve this peacefully? For the Radiance to back down from their desperate assault? To get the Pale King to actually cooperate with another Higher Being? Well, that’s quite the surprise. But a happy one, to be sure. And one the Radiance is more than willing to reward. They may have weakened in their time sealed, but still, they grant a small orb of light that seems to fuse into your very being. It fills you with a warmth, soft and fuzzy. But more notably, it fills you with power, or the potential for such.%%%%You have been granted a small spark of power which grants the ability to utilize SOUL magic based on Light. At the start, you may summon rays that scorch foes, or a soft light to protect allies, but eventually, you could summon storms of pure light energy, countless beams incinerating countless foes, create volleys of orbs that relentlessly hunt down targets, and soothing auras to mend the wounds of large groups.%%%%In addition, in thanks, the Radiance is willing to don a physical form and offer themselves as a companion in your journey. You may turn this down, they have no qualms, but they could be a powerful ally capable of incredibly potent light magic in consort with an adept manipulation of minds, to the point where they can create entire hiveminds even in a weakened, desperate state.,,
