Name,,Type,,CP Change,,Active,,Chained,,Description,,Notes
Starting CP,,6,,10000,,True,,False,,,,
Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You're dropped in at the outskirts of the city in a secluded area. You get an ID card, a stipend, an apartment to live in, and a school to go to. The city has no records of your abilities though. All they have is your name, your ethnicity, your date of birth, and a picture of your face. As a result, you could probably get away with doing things under the radar.,,
Student,,0,,-500,,False,,False,,You're a student of a school appropriate to your current age and gender, which you can choose, within reason. Though it's a stable life and you're guaranteed to learn new things, spending years studying here might not be appealing to you. Despite that, academy city's technological prowess is second to none, and studying as hard as you can, for as long as you can, might just pay off in the end. Also, you're guaranteed to have fun, interesting classmates, and will make friends and memories quickly.,,
Spy,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,You were a spy for a magical organisation outside Academy city but were caught within 24 hours. Who you currently work for is anyone's guess. Since then, you're been supplying information to both sides, and dabbling in the underworld to get it. You have knowledge of, and maybe access to magic, but using this kind of magic from this world hurts you and might even kill you as you're an esper now. Mana and an esper's altered brain don't mix.,,
Experiment,,0,,-1000,,False,,False,,You were a Child Error, or in other words, an orphan left in Academy City in hopes of you having a better life. However, shortly after, you were taken by a laboratory, trained, and used for an experiment. You're more powerful than most others as a result, but you're put on a tight leash. Although the experiments are over, you have little to no freedom and may be forced to do some questionable things. Hope you want to be in a black ops organisation.,,
Esper Abilities,,1,,00,,False,,False,,All abilities start from Level 1%%You can roll dice to determine one esper ability for free, but you cannot choose more than one if you do so,,
Clairvoyance,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,This ability allows you to see through objects at first and gain information on objects at higher levels. At lower levels, you might be restricted to checking for concealed weapons reading books without opening them, or simply putting this ability to some rather naughty uses. However, as you get better you'll be able to determine the location origin past, and maybe even future of things. Might even develop into a form of precognition. You'll be able to know the probable outcomes the chances of success of a plan what might happen to the character ten years from now, the uses of an ancient artifact and destroy an annoying angsty person's speech on his dreadful past by recounting it exactly as it happened.,,Level difference: X-Ray vision - See through walls - Precognition - Determine object details - See the past - Future sight
Telepathy,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Transmission of information from one person to another through the use of an invisible wire made by the user through the manipulation of the vibrations of air to create a frequency. Any part of the body can create a connection though you'll need to recall the person's name or face to create one. The number and range of connections go up as your level increases culminating in the ability to give orders to a few people. The telepath can discern the location of the people he is connected to and can also control the sound level though doing the second can get quite draining. Come to think of it. You might be able to weaponise this because of that.,,Level Difference: Ventriloquism > Speak to others a block away > Weaponised telepathy > Send images > City wide connections > Give mental orders to a few people
Telekinesis,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,This form of telekinesis allows you to create a field of force that affects an object you wish to manipulate. Control decreases the closer you get to your weight limit and maximum range. Through that, you might be able to fly fire telekinetic bullets. Maintain telekinetic shielding accelerate objects to insane speeds or simply tear people apart. The amount of hands you can maintain at once and the weight moved increases per level. Range maxes out at 100m. Has a lot of potential for mayhem and huge versatility especially with creative use.,,Level Difference: Lift light objects > Throw objects around > Move 232.44kg within 100m > Force walls > God of motion
Teleporter,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,This is a pretty rare ability as you'll be the 20th that can teleport multiple things at once. Anything you teleport displaces whatever it's teleported into but teleporting yourself into solids still hurts. To teleport things you'll have to do 11th-dimensional calculations, so if something such as pain is impacting your ability to think it won't work. You also have a cooldown that's proportionate to distance travelled. Despite you only being able to teleport objects you touch, as you get stronger your cool-down time decreases while the number & total weight of objects and range of teleportation increases. Hell, I'll throw in the ability to teleport objects from your warehouse to you at level 4 for free. This has a lot of raw power considering that teleporting things into people can be really lethal.,,Level difference: Teleport small objects > Teleport heavier objects > Teleport objects rapidly > Teleport yourself, total 130.7kg > Country-wide teleportation
Electromancer,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Electrokinesis is a very common ability but few have your growth potential. You gain a multitude of different abilities and increased power output as your level increases. You have telepathic immunity and control of yourself even in a vegetative state. At level 5 you might be able to have a danger sense & 360 degree vision through analysing electromagnetic waves hack into objects through decoding the electronic flow of information or even fire metal objects at three times the speed of sound. Calling down lightning bolts firing a coin at 1030m/s and unleashing bridge-ruining blasts of electricity will also be well within your repertoire. Loads of destructive ability if you play your cards right.,,Level differences: Sparks fly between fingers > 5000 volts > Control over electromagnetism current and voltage > see EM waves coilgun > Railgun, call down lightning
Pyrokinesis,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Less common than electromaster, but again, few have your growth potential. Your maximum energy used to heat things up and the amount of abilities increase as your level increases. Although this ability doesn't have as much utility, it more than makes up for it in raw power. After all, creating firestorms of destruction, bombs of fire, melting someone's head off from a distance, as well as turning yourself into fire so bullets pass through you gets pretty damn amazing. You won't even have to play your cards right for destruction ability with this one.,,Level difference: Control fire > Jets of flame > Heat sense, explosive homing fireballs > Spontaneous ignition in line of sight, heat rays > Firestorms, fire body
Meltdowner,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Also known as a particle waveform high-speed cannon. The laws of physics are stretched in this universe, but this makes them almost hit the breaking point. In essence, this ability allows you to fire particle beams of electrons that pierce through objects at the same velocity it was fired, defeating armour. You can also redirect electricity with this, create shields that disintegrate things on contact or turn yourself into a living rocket; though that's all you can do. However, it can be stopped through energy shielding or really really thick and strong armour beyond the tech level here and is incapable of rapid-fire and area saturation. Regardless this is the most destructive ability here and gets even more destructive when you take off the mental limiters preventing you from damaging or even killing yourself.,,Level difference: Weak beam, punch-level strength > Stronger beams, 2 beams > 3 beams. Redirect electricity > Create shields that disintegrate things > 4 beams
Free Pick or Imagine Breaker,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Levels are irrelevant with the hand. This ancient ability cannot be measured by level anyway, as it's not based on the same principles as the others.%%%%Your right hand, or the closest equivalent and any right hands that might replace your current one in the future get the ability to negate anything supernatural by touch, such as magic or esper powers, with some exceptions, such as leylines and anything with enough power. As such you're helpless against supernatural attacks that come in great numbers, extremely powerful attacks that surpass your power canceling speed, or anything natural like bullets.%%%%If your right arm or the closest equivalent is replaced the power manifests in your new right arm. However, if your right arm is severed unwillingly you can choose to let the invisible thing powering it manifest as dragons and attempt to defeat your enemies in the vicinity or simply regrow your right arm. Be careful though, if you lose control it will be the end of you.%%%%As you can nullify the red string of fate all the bitches will be on you. However, you also nullify any good luck but not any plot armour, luck makes your chances better, plot armour prevents you from dying. You will definitely be noticed and used due to this ability as it's the McGuffin of the magical world. Please note that you do not have the mc's plot armour. If you pull the shit he does things will not end well. Then again, the imagine breaker doesn't affect your own supernatural abilities%%%%After ten years the bad luck will be an inconvenience and at worst make you miserable for some time. It won't kill you or affect you in combat though, and good luck perks still work. They just get gimped outside combat. Take bad luck and keikaku keystone and gain no points for them. They don't count towards the drawback limit though.,,
Drop In - True Gift,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You're less likely to give up. When faced with an insurmountable task, such as climbing a mountain, you're more likely to succeed by pushing through the pain or at least get dragged away kicking and screaming than actually giving up. In a fight, you won't back down easily and you're likely to keep going until the bitter end or you decide on a strategic retreat. Problems with cowardice will not be problems any longer with the purchase of this perk.,,
Drop In - True Sight,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,They say that to beat an esper, you first calmly analyse the opponent then find a way to defeat him. Your analytical skills are increased to the point that you can see through someone's actions in the present to find their weak point whether it be in a fight or in something like a football match or a cook-off you can discern their weaknesses and exploit that to defeat them more easily than you would have otherwise, keep in mind that this isn't the same as precognition as this provides knowledge you can easily explain to others. An impenetrable defence is no longer impenetrable as long as you're around.,,
Drop In - Premonition Precog,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You get a kind of precognition that's only useful in fights. You unconsciously read an opponent's involuntary movements such as their facial expressions and movements and use these to subconsciously anticipate the attacks coming your way & judge what to do next accurately. Through this, you gain almost-perfect timing and the unconscious knowledge of what to do next to get the best results in any fight to the point that some might mistake this as ridiculously good luck or even plot armour. If taken with clairvoyance this ascends to truly ridiculous levels, think protagonist level plot armour. And if taken with imagine breaker this provides you the timing and intuition necessary to use your power to maximum effect giving you insane defence.,,
Student - Slice of Life,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,Your daily life unfolds like a slice of life anime. In theory. This wouldn't do much, and you probably won't notice the difference, however your life becomes a lot more cheerful and enjoyable than it was previously. People are much nicer to you than before and you can get away with most minor wrongdoings and have no lasting consequences for some more severe ones. You'll be able to live in the present without being bogged down by your past and enjoy your life without getting hindered by conflict too much. Regardless of the situation, you're somehow capable of always looking on the bright side of life even though you may face an invasion your impending execution or the like you take things for granted less and something like a sweet dessert never fails to put a smile to your face.,,
Student - Motivated,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You're much much more motivated than before you find it easy to dedicate yourself to things and self-discipline will no longer be a problem. You also rediscover or discover your love of learning and will be more than willing to spend weeks on learning stopping only to eat and sleep. As a bonus, you have godly research skills and will almost always seem to find the information you're looking for as long as you search hard enough. In addition, your memory is also improved to help you keep up with perfect memory and highly efficient memory indexing. Given enough time and effort almost everything will be within your grasp regardless of whether it's a cure for cancer fil or something along those lines. You should eventually find it. I might take eons though so don t die before il,,
Student - Hard Science,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have knowledge of academy city's science and technology to rival a scientist with a doctorate and several years of experience under his belt. You're much more intelligent analytical and can easily keep your cool under pressure and rein in your emotions. You also gain a doctorate s worth of regular scientific knowledge in the discipline of your choice. You know the inner workings of recoil mitigating systems and powered armour but your true specialty is the esper creation and development process given enough time you might just figure out a way to get rid of the randomness inherent in the process and give x person y ability training an esper to help him reach his maximum potential is child's play. You could probably pass as a member of the illustrious and brilliant Kihara family due to your sheer expertise and brilliance just that your sense of ethics would give you away, right?,,
Spy - Dark Sider,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You're intimately acquainted with the academy city's underworld and by extension the people in charge of the city itself. You know whom to contact whom to blackmail and whom to get the blackmail from this also helps in keeping you safe as you know whom to steer clear from and whom to get others to steer clear from you. If you ever get into trouble decide to set up a gang get information or simply keep your head down in a city full of surveillance cameras you can bet that these new connections will help you out.,,
Spy - Critical,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You're a good spy, that much can be said. You can sneak around gather information and assassinate targets. However, your real talent lies in your acting skills. You'll never break cover and you can spin a thick web of lies. You il be able to avoid fights altogether by tricking enemies into surrendering with just a light switch and some convincing acting, turning the tide of a battle causing an enemy outpost to surrender, or causing infighting in enemy factions with a bluff will not be beyond you. You will go down in history as a master of ruses rivalling some of the greatest master rusemen throughout the ages,,
Spy - Magician,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You have knowledge of magic as well as the ability to cast magic by yourself. You are very very good at teaching others magic and were an accomplished magician in the school of magic of your choice. Whether it was alchemy. Summoning healing or simply destructive evocation of an element you were one of the best at it in addition you were also proficient at other basic schools that arent your specialties like evocation and some basic application of rituals. However ever since you became an esper the negative side effects of using magic as an esper have threatened to take your life every time you were forced to use them. Despite that, you have a strange feeling that you might be able to bypass this whether it's by getting someone else to heal you or by other more sinister and obscure means.,,
Experiment - Formal Training,,1,,-1000,,False,,True,,You get training in the use of your abilities. This might not seem like much, but this il help you apply your powers better you'll be able to think of different uses for them more quickly and as a result, do things you couldn't do before, that passive telekinetic shield wet dream is suddenly a lot more realistic now. Though all this does is speed up the process. Without the perk, you should still get it. Eventually. But hey, extra guidance on how your weird new abilities work is always great.,,
Experiment - Doubled Growth Rate,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,Your esper abilities take half as much time to develop you might just be able to hit level 5 by the time the jump ends and to get more powerful faster, careful though, power takes time to get used to and if you're not trained or don't practice enough you might not be able to get used to your strength. After all, what's the point of having power if you can't use it?,,
Experiment - Malleable Reality,,1,,-6000,,False,,True,,You're more imaginative than usual though you'll become quite eccentric you can change what you believe in or your personal reality, more easily. Your powers grow slightly faster (1.25x now and don't have to make sense anymore. As a result, you could probably do some crazy shit such as making homing ball lightning or creating constructs of fire that act as matter with enough training you might even be able to stave off some of the side effects from using magic as an esper by imagining something else to be part of your body and having the side effects impact that instead. If you're willing to become even crazier though the sky's the limit for what you can do after all the more insane you get the stronger your esper powers grow. That said a little eccentricity can go a long way. Screw being scientifically correct,,
