Drop In,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You just got here - one moment there was no one there and the next minute you were there, as if you’d just come around a corner. Good job no one was looking that way.%%%%+ No public records of your existence%%+ Never played Glory before%%- You’re an unknown quantity to the Glory scene,,
Glory Fan,,0,,00,,False,,False,,Not everyone plays for the money - you’re just in this for the fun of the game and the community.

Rookie Pro,,0,,00,,False,,False,,You were head-hunted by one of the Alliance teams less than two years ago as a notable talent and hired on. After a period of intense training you’ve been allowed to take a reserve or even starting slot on the team.%%%%+ You’ve got local citizenship and identification%%+ You’re recognised as an excellent Glory player, with potential to be more%%+ If you’re with a Club they’ll provide you with a high level Glory%%account as long as you play for them.%%- As a professional, you’re under supervision of your seniors and expected not to bring your team into disrepute.,,

Speak Mandarin Like A Mandarin?,,1,,00,,True,,True,,Since you’re probably going to be spending a lot of time in mainland China, you’re now completely fluent in written and verbal Mandarin.,,
Drop In - Shameless,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You’ll never feel that your status makes you above doing scrub work or using dirty tactics like scrap picking.,,
Drop In - Demon of the Well,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,When you want to, you can scare someone silly - sneaking up behind them, saying something ominous or just spearing them with a death-glare. This might buy you a moment’s distraction or warn them off entirely.,,
Drop In - Lucky Drops,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,You’ll never get stuck killing the same monsters over and over for just one specific drop or body-part you need. The rarer the creature (IRL or in a game) the more likely you are to receive the desired item, so a trash mob might require killing a dozen or so while a rare beast or one of Glory’s weekly bosses is almost always has what you want right away.,,
Drop In - Do You Even DPS?,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,On the fundamental level, you win fights by harming your opponent and you’re an expert in this - if equipment and skills are level you will usually do notably more damage than the opposition whether it’s a boss another player or a fist-fight in an alleyway.,,
Drop In - Hide Your Face,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,Anonymity is hard to come by in the modern age - you certainly can’t expect to hide your name without illegal behaviour. But your face is another matter and for some reason no one will be concerned if you cover your face with a scarf or insist on playing behind a screen so that no one identifies your face.,,
Drop In - Use Him For Hard Labor,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,It’s not even remotely uncommon for Guilds to create disposable accounts that can join rival guilds as spies. However, in order to join a guild you have to show that you’re useful to them. When running a organisation, if you have a suspected spy you’ll always know the maximum benefit you can squeeze out of them for your group.,,
Glory Fan - Find a Guide,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,For any legal pursuit you have in mind, all you need is access to the internet or a library and you’ll turn up a basic level guidebook for it in seconds.,,
Glory Fan - Curiously Charming,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,People seem to find your quirks and habits not only tolerable but actually amusing unless they’re specifically hindering them right now. Even then they’ll forgive you immediately for any annoyance caused.,,
Glory Fan - Trash Talk,,1,,-3000,,False,,True,,You know what’s annoying? Someone who won’t shut up. What’s worse is when they won’t stop taunting and insulting you. You’re a master of putting people off their game with this sort of annoyance.,,
Glory Fan - Do You Even Heal?,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Endurance is a key factor in fights and recovering from taking a hit can make all the difference. You’re an expert in directing your healing skills across a team, almost always recovering health more efficiently than other healers working with the same skills and equipment.,,
Glory Fan - Glory Has Never Been Something You Play Alone,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,Glory’s dungeons are intended for 5-100 players and professional matches always include a team stage. Players who act as a coherent team are many times as effective as the same number acting without coordination - and you can direct a team to obtain this great advantage.,,
Glory Fan - What Level Advantage?,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,You’re an expert in fighting giant monsters, so good that you’re able to surpass expectations of how well you should be able to fight against them. You can solo against opponents that should require a full team or step up and fight against monsters considered above your level without disadvantage.,,
Rookie Pro - Know the Ropes,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,You know how MMO players think and can quickly figure out what will get you the best deals for selling material or joining a guild or pick-up group.,,
Rookie Pro - Eye for Equipment?,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,For some reason you have a flawless eye for what people are wearing and recollection of that. In an MMO where costume choices are a little more finite than IRL, you can easily identify what a player is equipped with.,,
Rookie Pro - Timing,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,Due to the cooldowns on skills, careful timing lets you make the most of your skills. You’ve got a good sense for the moment when a using a skill will reap the most benefit and when it’s better to wait for a future opportunity.,,
Rookie Pro - Do You Even Tank,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,The single most vital role in taking down a boss is controlling their aggro, keeping them focused on attacking the team’s tanks. You’re an expert in judging how much damage can be done without letting a boss go ‘off-tank’ and how to compensate. You can even manage multiple bosses at once!,,
Rookie Pro - Ungodly APM,,1,,-5000,,True,,True,,Actions Per Minute: how many controlled commands can you input in a minute? Any idiot can hammer mindlessly on a keyboard, but precisely thought out combinations makes a difference. Your APM is over four hundred, higher than many professional players!,,
Rookie Pro - PK PK PK PK PK PK!,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Fighting other players demands more flexibility than fighting mobs and bosses, which is where you excel. In any formal single combat that should be a level playing field - an arena match or a formal duel - you’re in fact at your best, hyper-focused and stepping up beyond your full potential.,,
Veteran Pro - l2p,,1,,-1000,,True,,True,,For any computer game you can quickly grasp the mechanics and how to exploit them, only ever needing to see them once to understand.,,
Veteran Pro - Do It With Style,,1,,-2000,,True,,True,,There are certain styles of fighting and you can excellently copy another’s. This doesn’t mean you understand it, but monkey-see, monkey-do can get you by in an emergency. It’s also convincing for bluffs.,,
Veteran Pro - Old Dog, New Tricks,,1,,-3000,,True,,True,,There’s many a problem that looks very different years later. If you return at least a year later to a problem you’ve faced before, you’re certain to see a new possible approach to resolving it.,,
Veteran Pro - Do You Even Control?,,1,,-4000,,True,,True,,Control of the battlefield gives control of the outcome - deprive an opponent of mobility, of the use of their skills, even of the knowledge of where you are... Glory has many skills and equipment items that can let you do this and you’re an expert, rarely ever having to fight on even terms.,,
Veteran Pro - Manage Player’s Aggro,,1,,-5000,,False,,True,,Everyone has a talent and one of yours is getting people steaming mad at you. To the point of attacking you, perhaps at the expense of your more vulnerable compatriots, chasing you into a trap or rage-quitting. As with managing mob aggro, it’s a delicate art to get the result you want.,,
Veteran Pro - Awesome At Analysis,,1,,-6000,,True,,True,,Beyond recognising or copying what you see, you can obtain a deeper understanding. In a numbers-based system like a computer game you’ll be able to break down any numerical system into factors and work out how to apply them with maximum efficiency, even extrapolating for possible options that haven’t been made available yet.,,
McDonald’s Vouchers,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,You’ve a roll of twelve vouchers for McDonald’s “What A Big Cone” promotion - each voucher gets you a free ice cream (you may only exchange one at a time) and the roll replenishes each day. Accepted at any McDonald’s (or thinly disguised fictional equivalent) in any jump.,,
Pack of Cigarettes,,2,,-500,,False,,True,,A slightly crumpled pack of cigarettes that somehow always seems to be half-full every time you take it out. Even if you empty it out, just put it back in a pocket and retrieve it to get more. Don’t smoke in no-smoking areas.,,
Your Account Card,,2,,-1440,,True,,False,,For every 50cp spent here, you can start with 2 Glory Points added the value of your Account Cards, see the next section.,,Purchased three times for six Glory Points
High Quality Headset, Mouse & Keyboard,,2,,-1000,,True,,True,,Real professional quality gear, able to stand up to the abuse of a serious player going all out while still having a good response time. They also have several conformable controls, letting them adjust to other games if for some reason you didn’t want to play Glory.,,
Gamer’s Chair,,2,,-1500,,True,,True,,An ergonomically designed gaming chair, ideal for sitting in for hours without any discomfort at all. Height, arms, back support and head support will all adjust automatically to your needs. While you’re sat on this you won’t experience any calls of nature whatsoever - although as soon as you leave the chair, any deferred needs of this sort will become due.,,
Gaming Spec PC,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,You’ve got a really nice computer set-up, with graphics and audio optimised for your gaming needs and a huge, high-resolution screen so you can see everything and maybe not get your view covered with chat bubbles. It’s always top of the line, wherever you are.,,
A Nice Apartment,,2,,-2000,,True,,True,,A three bedroom apartment (well, two and a half - the last is more of a box room) with a well-lit lounge, small kitchen and a nice bathroom. This apartment will appear at some plausible location in future jumps and has a door into your warehouse that only you and your companions can see.,,
Internet Cafe,,2,,-4000,,True,,True,,Somehow you’ve inherited an internet cafe: a rather nice open-plan main floor with a control desk and a couple of hundred computer workstations, as well as several smaller rooms upstairs that can be rented out, used for meetings, storage or even accommodation. In future jumps it’ll adjust to be something plausible for the local culture. In any case, this requires minimal supervision and provides a modest but comfortable income.,,
Glory Is Eternal,,2,,-4000,,False,,True,,Strangely, in the future, any world with comparable computer technology or better will have this MMO as an active game and even a professional league.,,
Account Cards,,2,,50,,True,,False,,Every character account on Glory has a physical presence in the real world: an account card (much like a bank card) that is slotted into your computer to play. The card is the sole official repository of the character’s build and equipment so if you lose it you’ve lost the character entirely.%%%%You can buy as many account cards as you want to start the jump with. In future jumps you’ll be able to slot a card into a computer running any game you want and use the character on it in the game, replacing a properly created character for the game. However unlikely it is or how out of genre, the game and it’s administrators will accept this as entirely legitimate.%%%%You may begin with an account card or cards valued at 5 Glory Points (gp). This value can be increased by spending cp on Your Account Card(s).,,
Server,,2,,00,,False,,False,,An account can only be played on one server and in the Heavenly Domain (equipment from the latter can’t be taken back to the home server). Select one of the nine active servers at no cost. You may select the new tenth server if you wish, but there is a 50cp surcharge if the account doesn’t have:%%%%Level: Blank%%Skill Points: Nothing Special%%Equipment: White%%Guild Membership: None%%%%At this time only admin accounts should have any more than this on the 10th server and having such an account will give you a head start there.,,
Level - Heavenly Domain,,2,,-20,,True,,True,,Blank?%%The account card hasn’t even had a character created on it at all yet - you’ll need to name your character, choose their appearance and allocate the first few skill points before you can use it.%%%%Low Level?%%The account card has a level between 1 and 19. You’re too low level even to dungeon but you can complete quests. And if you want to get higher up then it should only take a day or two to level up the account.%%%%Mid-Level?%%Having assigned a class at level 20 (assuming you did so), you’re still somewhere below level 55 - the lowest level there’s content for in the Heavenly Domain. Still, there’s lots of content on the normal servers for you and you can run dungeons up to three times a day...%%%%High Level?: -1%%You’re now at a level where you could tackle endgame content, starting with the original level 50 and 55 dungeons and going up to level 70. Most players who’ve stuck with Glory will have an account at this level, and of course this is the only level found in the Heavenly Domain.%%%%Heavenly Domain?: -1, Free for Rookie Pro and Veteran Pro%%This is an enhancement for High Level accounts only. The account is logged as having completed the Heavenly Domain Challenge, a gruelling set of PvE and PvP requirements, and may now be played in the Heavenly Domain.,,
Skill Points - Notable,,2,,-20,,True,,True,,Not all accounts of the same level are equal. Each level provides skill points to invest in the character’s skills (limited by class) and a level 70 character will receive 4,000 skill points through levelling... but the maximum number of skill points is 5,000. Players obtain by extra skill points by earning skill books providing 5-25 extra skill points as rare drops - at this time the highest known number of skill points for any account is 4,880.%%%%Nothing Special?%%You’ve amassed less than 200 extra skill points on your account, which is nothing to boast of.%%%%Respectable?: -1%%Between 200 and 700 extra skill points marks your account as a strong one, worthy of a skilled player of Glory.%%%%Notable?: -2%%Over 700 extra skill points would make this account suitable for use in professional play.,,
Equipment - Silver,,2,,-40,,True,,True,,Equipment in Glory is colour coded by rarity although gear of each colour is available from a low level. Rare gear is naturally better so while your account should have level-appropriate items, rarer gear is an advantage.%%%%White?%%Gear that can be bought from an NPC. Don’t expect to be taken seriously if this is all you have.%%%%Green?%%This is the sort of gear you might predictably receive from completing quests. Are you even trying?%%%%Blue?: -1%%A few high level quests might give you this gear but you probably got it from a dungeon boss - so it’s worth at least a little respect.%%%%Purple?: -2%%This gear drops in dungeons and from field bosses. Most players rely mostly on this level so you’ve got some substance to you.%%%%Orange?: -3%%The really good stuff, the best and rarest drops in the game. Using this marks you out as a serious player, worth including in a raid.%%%%Silver: -4%%This gear doesn’t drop, it’s made by players and potentially it can be better than even orange gear. Still, it takes a lot of experimentation and rare materials to make such gear so it’s mostly used by professionals.,,
Guild Membership - Club Guild,,2,,-30,,True,,True,,While no one has to join a guild, Glory has open world PVP so unless you’re good enough to keep from being PKed it’s at least worth considering joining a guild so someone’s got your back. The benefits aren’t limited to that, though. Guilds usually provide access to shared stores of equipment until you can get your own, as well as advice and helping you to find a party.%%%%None?%%You’ve got to walk your own path? Just watch your back - there’s nothing to stop you getting PKed for your gear.%%%%Independent Guild: -1%%An ordinary guild, probably made up of a loose network of friends. A little security but very little freedom is given up in excahnge.%%%%Hidden Guild?: -1%%Hidden Guild? (1gp) While this guild appears to be independent, in fact it’s a secret associate of a Club. This means they have a little more resources to offer, but you might be asked to take part in activities intended to deniably advance the Club.%%%%Club Associate?: -2%%Each professional Club maintains a primary guild and several openly associated guilds, which are primarily made up of the hardcore of the club’s fanbase. As Clubs rise and fall, so does the influence and number of players in their guilds. Such guilds tend to have a fairly tight command structure and have to worry about spies... but they can sometimes even call on professional players to help them out. It makes for great PR.%%%%Club Guild: -3%%The biggest, most respected and therefore powerful guilds in Glory – guilds associated with the Clubs at the top of professional alliance. Currently Tyrannical Ambition, Herb Garden and Blue Brook are considered the Three Great Guilds with unrivalled resources and numbers.,,
Class,,2,,00,,False,,False,,Finally you should pick a class and sub-class. There’s no charge for this.%%%%If you wish not to pick a class and remain Unspecialized, you can build your character using classes available below level 20 to any of 24 subclasses - which is still a good selection. Different skills require different weapons though, and switching a weapon takes time, it can be... inconvenient to be caught without a weapon during these intervals. If you want to try this and change your mind later, you can always pick a class but this will lock out the skills not available to your chosen class and you don’t get the skill points back so what would the point be?%%,,
Fighter,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Striker%%The fastest and most mobile of the fighter classes.%%%%Grappler%%Optimised for getting close and controlling an opponent’s actions with pins and throws.%%%%Brawler%%Focused on ‘dirty’ skills like throwing sand in an opponent’s eyes or bricks to stun them.%%%%Qi Master%%An all-rounder balancing offensive and defensive skills. Does magic damage.,,
Gunner,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Launcher%%Uses a large cannon and missiles for devastating long range firepower but quite weak at closer ranges.%%%%Mechanic%%Flies using a rotor and deploys mechanical traps and bombs.%%%%Sharpshooter%%Armed with a revolver and unarmed combat skills. Skilled users can dual wield%%%%Spitfire%%Armed with a diverse range of specialist ammunitions to control the field,,
Mage,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Battle Mage%%Combines spear-wielding with elemental damage techniques.%%%%Elementalist%%Focused on ranged DPS using one or more elemental affiliations.%%%%Summoner%%Why fight on your own when you can summon up a small host of monsters to fight for you?%%%%Witch%%Flies on a broomstick and employs a variety of magical items to fight with.,,
Night Warrior,,2,,00,,False,,True,,Assassin%%Dagger-wielding warriors focused on avoiding detection and outflanking opponents.%%%%Ninja%%Stealthy with many decoy skills and armed with ninja tools such as shuriken and caltrops.%%%%Thief%%Focused upon laying traps for targets that can cause Damage Over Time.%%%%Warlock%%Very weak up close but superb for crowd control.,,
Swordsman - Spell Blade,,2,,00,,True,,True,,Berserker%%Built around slow but very damaging melee attacks with a high alpha damage.%%%%Blade Master%%Focused on combos of quick attacks to keep a target off-balance.%%%%Ghost Blade%%Mostly uses magic attacks and buffs to control the battlefield.%%%%Spell Blade%%Use magic to enhance their sword skills and cause extra damage.,,
Best Partnership,,3,,-1000,,False,,False,,Import one companion who receives 600cp and may take up to 300cp of drawbacks.,,
Dungeon Party,,3,,-2000,,False,,False,,Import up to four companions (enough that you can have a full party for a 5-man dungeon), with points as per Best Partnership.,,
Challenge Team,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,Import up to nine companions (the maximum number of professional players that an Alliance Club can maintain is ten) per Best Partnership.,,
‘Sleeping Moon’,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,Something of a scoundrel, Sleeping Moon is part of the independent guild Full Moon. He’s come to the 10th Server to establish the guild there - and to make a profit at the expense of new players. Shortly he’ll earn the nickname ‘Little Moon Moon’. Although he’s a blade master, he’s a huge Ye Qiu fan.,,
Chen Guo,,3,,-1000,,False,,True,,A five year veteran of Glory and passionate Su Mucheng fan, ‘GuoGuo’ is a member of the Excellent Dynasty Guild and owns the Joyful Flourish internet cafe. Her account, Chasing Haze, is a launcher like her idol’s account.,,
Bao Rongxing,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,A towering security guard at an internet cafe, Bao Rongxing will just be starting playing Glory when the 10th server opens. He’s an easy going soul, who brawls and parties thoughtlessly, acting on his feelings which can make him unpredictable to those around him.,,
Tang Rou,,3,,-2000,,False,,True,,A very pretty girl who works at Joyful Flourish. She’s easily bored by things that are too easy for her and considers Glory very simple, but as she has outrageous APM, GuoGuo sometimes has her use Chasing Haze to boost her arena record for her.,,
Qiao Yifan,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,A reserve player for the Tiny Herb team who hasn’t yet been used as a substitute. Lacking confidence and the respect of his team, he has no regularly assigned account but Tiny Herb’s captain believes he has potential that might be better developed elsewhere.,,
Xu Boyuan,,3,,-3000,,False,,True,,One of the Five Great Experts of Blue Brook Guild, Xu Boyuan has been sent to set up the guild’s branch in the 10th Server. Honest and straightforward he’s created a new Blade Master account, Blue River, for use on the new server.,,
Su Mucheng,,3,,-4000,,False,,True,,A top level professional player since the second season of the Glory Alliance and the best launcher player. Su Mucheng is a beautiful young woman and receives excellent sponsorship. She plays for Excellent Era and her account is Dancing Rain.,,
Ye Qiu,,3,,-4000,,False,,True,,Known as both one of the four ‘Master Tacticians’ and playing God-ranked Battle Mage account One Autumn Leaf, Ye Qiu has never shown his face in public but he led Excellent Era to three championship victories. Tomorrow his retirement from professional play will be announced.,,
Drawbacks,,4,,00,,False,,False,,You can take drawbacks with a total base value of up to 800cp, not including any extra cp you receive for taking drawbacks matched to your background.,,
Camera Shy,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,200 CP for Drop In%%%%It’s vitally important to you that no one puts a name to your face (particularly if your identification isn’t entirely legal). As a result you have to bow out on any sponsorship deals or publicity. Glory is an acceptable false-face so it doesn’t matter if footage of you playing makes it onto TV, but otherwise you’re going to be very reclusive.,,
Know Nothing,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,150 CP for Glory Fan%%%%Reading a guidebook? Where’s the fun in that? You’ll only learn how to play through hands on experience and probably getting yelled at in chat about what your skills do. Perks that enhance learning are unavailable to you.,,
Guild Demands Attention,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,150 CP for Rookie Pro%%%%Either through a club or personal associations, there’s a guild that keeps calling you in to do favours for them - to back them up on a boss fight, to help get a time record. They’ll call you in fifty or sixty times through the next ten years and you can never actually decline.,,
Retirement,,4,,1000,,False,,False,,150 CP for Veteran Pro%%%%Perhaps you’re too old (25 is ancient) or there was some contractual issues, but you’ve been forced out of the Glory Alliance. Having formally retired you’re not allowed to return to professional play for a full year.,,
Chat Gossip Fodder,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Drop In%%%%Someone’s dropping your account name repeatedly in chat, and not in a good way. Accusations of letting your party get killed so you can take all the loot, that sort of thing. Looks like you’ve upset some keyboard warrior.,,
Lousy Mechanics,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Drop In%%%%You’re just embarrassingly bad at moving your character and targeting your attacks. Expect to be walking into trees, falling into wells and hitting your own party with attacks.,,
Wanna Guess My Sign,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Glory Fan%%%%You’re not taking this very seriously. You’re easily distracted and liable to tangent conversations to whatever catches your attention, even if it has nothing to do with Glory or whatever you’re doing at the moment.,,
Lone Wolf,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Glory Fan%%%%You can’t coordinate with other players to save your own life - whether you like it or not, you’re a one step above being a deadweight in team fights and as part of a party with a very unfortunate tendency to drop AoEs where someone was about to move, use superfluous buffs or pull aggro away from the main tank. At least you’re more hit points the opponent needs to destroy.,,
Easily Provoked,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Rookie Pro%%%%You might want to calm down a bit. No, I’m not telling you what to do... Could you be any easier to troll? Probably not, you’re just the sort of person who responds to criticism in an aggressive fashion. Anyone who knows you can push your buttons to make you accept a challenge or just to get a rise.,,
Let’s Duel!,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Rookie Pro%%%%You’re obsessed with Glory, and with one specific aspect: fighting other players one-on-one. All your spare time is spent hanging around the Arena and if for some reason you move around in game you’ll drop all other objectives for the chance to fight a challenging looking opponent. Expect your relationships with others suffer, unless they’re in Glory too and doing the same sort of thing.,,
Glory is Serious Business,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Veteran Pro%%%%You can’t understand all these filthy casuals who claim ‘it’s just a game’. You treat everything in Glory with the utmost seriousness, as if it has life or death importance which Guild kills a particular wild boss. It’s best not to get you started on analyzing which Club should win this season’s championship.,,
Grudge?,,4,,2000,,False,,False,,300 CP for Veteran Pro%%%%There’s someone out there that really, really wants to beat you. No, not just beat. That’s not enough. Destroy, that’s the thing. In their mind you’ve done them wrong and things won’t be right again until your life, online and offline has been ruined. You might be able to reason with them (although they’re not very reasonable) but I really don’t recommend killing them or you’ll have to deal with police convinced that you’re a murderer.,,
Penniless,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,450 CP for Drop In%%%%For the duration of your jump, your Glory account(s) have access to your warehouse and all items you brought with you from previous jumps... but you don’t. Of course, if you start pulling out battlecruisers and super-weapons in the game, other players may complain to the GMs. And items from Glory can’t be put into your warehouse.,,
Crippled Hands,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,450 CP for Glory Fan%%%%Your hand speed is just atrocious - you have trouble getting past 100 commands a minute, which is a huge handicap in Glory. This isn’t to say that you can’t play, but you’ll have to be very strategic and avoid any situation where APM is the deciding factor. (If you take the Ungodly APM perk then it will offer no benefit until the end of this jump).,,
Ye Xiu/Qiu?,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,450 CP for Rookie Pro%%%%It seems you have an identical twin in this world and somehow he has a key to your warehouse. Expect that about half the time you want something from the warehouse, he’ll have borrowed it. He’s good about returning things, eventually.,,
Virtual Life,,4,,3000,,False,,False,,450 CP for Veteran Pro%%%%Welcome to being reduced to using your body-mod - for the duration of the jump all your perks, skills and so forth are unavailable to you... except inside the game of Glory where your accounts have full access to them. Which could almost be considered cheating...,,
